<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Texts &amp; Technology work is situated on an understanding of &quot;new&quot; media mechanisms, which includes the underlying layer of code. Throughout the core Texts &amp; Technology courses, we work to bridge the gaps of text, technology, and theory. In <em>Design &amp; Development</em>, we will put this understanding into practice, building towards confidence and flexibility in using procedural tools and digital methods in humanities research. While there are many languages potential relevant to T&amp;T and the digital humanities broadly, this course focuses on Python, which is currently one of the top choices for data analysis thanks to its tools (including Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks, which we will employ) and flexibility.</p>
<p>The bulk of the course will be spent experimenting: while at first it may seem there is minimal &quot;writing&quot; in this course, Annette Vee's framework reminds us that code itself fits in the rubric of literacy, and through reading and writing code (and using it as a lens for seeing other &quot;texts&quot;) we will build that procedural literacy. At the end of the course, we will put this knowledge into use through a larger project, building upon the exercises towards a potential future research application in an area of interest.</p>
<p>Each week, plan on following following instructions in the Webcourses module regarding readings and online exercises to accompany the in-class discussion. Each module will be divided into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Readings.</strong> Complete this combination of primary and secondary texts prior to attending the in-person meeting. The full schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus: additional recommended readings will be provided in each module.</li>
<li><strong>In-Person Overview.</strong> Each week's in-person meeeting will involve a combination of hands-on design and coding exercises, lab collaboration time, and discussions focused on understanding and applying concepts from the readings.</li>
<li><strong>Coding Exercises.</strong> A weekly online assignment to build your skills in programming, debugging, and applying code solutions to research and design problems.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop an understanding of programming, including basic terminology and the use of variables, functions, loops, libraries, and conditional statements.</li>
<li>Understand the installation, configuration, syntax, and debugging methods required for Python.</li>
<li>Apply digital humanities methods such as textual analysis, visualization, mapping, modeling, and data manipulation to a variety of potential projects.</li>
<li>Conceptualize a project using Python to answer a research question appropriate to the student's goals and area of specialization.</li>
<li>Reflect upon the design of technology, with critical attention to its engagement with theoretical frameworks and the assumptions and dangers of algorithmic methods.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="materials-and-texts">Materials and Texts</h2>
<p>This course requires a mix of applied and theoretical readings, including some open access materials. The primary texts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benjamin, Ruha. 2019. <em>Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code.</em> John Wiley &amp; Sons.</li>
<li>Drucker, Johanna. 2021. <a href="https://go.openathens.net/redirector/ucf.edu?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.taylorfrancis.com%2Fbooks%2Fmono%2F10.4324%2F9781003106531"><em>The Digital Humanities Coursebook: An Introduction to Digital Methods for Research and Scholarship.</em></a> Routledge.

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p><a href="http://academicintegrity.org/">The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)</a> defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.</p>
<p><strong>UCF Creed:</strong> Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.</li>
<li>Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.</li>
<li>Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.</li>
<li>Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.</li>
<li>Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should familiarize themselves with <a href="https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/">UCF’s Rules of Conduct</a>. According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in</p>
<ol>
<li>Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.</li>
<li>Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.</li>
<li>Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.</li>
<li>Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.</li>
<li>Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.</li>
<li>Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.</li>
<li>Helping another violate academic behavior standards.</li>
<li>Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="responses-to-academic-dishonesty-plagiarism-or-cheating">Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating</h3>
<p>Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, <a href="https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/">The Golden Rule</a>. UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.</p>
<h3 id="course-accessibility-statement">Course Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with <a href="http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/">Student Accessibility Services (SAS)</a> (Ferrell Commons 185, <a href="mailto:sas@ucf.edu">sas@ucf.edu</a>, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.</p>
<h3 id="land-acknowledgement-statement">Land Acknowledgement Statement</h3>
<p>The UCF Department of English acknowledges that our main campus stands on the traditional territories of the Seminole and Timucua peoples, and that other Native American traditional territories exist throughout Florida where our regional campuses are located. We collectively recognize their continuing connection to the land, water, and air and pay respect to their elders past, present, and emerging. We recognize the continuing consequences of colonialism on Indigenous peoples and their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and we fully endorse Indigenous Sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="campus-safety-statement">Campus Safety Statement</h3>
<p>Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.</li>
<li>Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the <a href="http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html">online version</a>.</li>
<li>Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.</li>
<li>If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see <a href="https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations">locations</a>.</li>
<li>To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <a href="https://my.ucf.edu">MyUCF</a> and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”</li>

<h3 id="deployed-active-duty-military-students">Deployed Active Duty Military Students</h3>
<p>Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="authorized-events-and-religious-observances">Authorized Events and Religious Observances</h3>
<p>Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.</p>
<p>Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the <a href="http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf">UCF policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="covid-19-statements-and-policies">COVID-19 Statements and Policies</h2>
<p>To protect members of our community, everyone is required to wear a facial covering inside all common spaces including <a href="https://policies.ucf.edu/documents/PolicyEmergencyCOVIDReturnPolicy.pdf">classrooms</a>. Students who choose not to wear facial coverings will be asked to leave the classroom by the instructor. If they refuse to leave the classroom or put on a facial covering, they may be considered disruptive (please see the Golden Rule for student behavior expectations). Faculty have the right to cancel class if the safety and well-being of class members are in jeopardy. Students will be responsible for the material that would have been covered in class as provided by the instructor.</p>
<p>Depending on the course of the pandemic during the semester, the university may make changes to the way classes are offered. If that happens, please look for announcements or messages in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email about changes specific to this course.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 and Illness Notification</strong> – Students who believe they may have a COVID-19 diagnosis should contact UCF Student Health Services (407-823-2509) so proper contact tracing procedures can take place.
Students should not come to campus if they are ill, are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, have tested positive for COVID, or if anyone living in their residence has tested positive or is sick with COVID-19 symptoms. CDC guidance for COVID-19 symptoms is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">located here</a></p>
<p>Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness reason to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made. When possible, students should contact their instructor(s) before missing class.</p>
<p><strong>In Case of Faculty Illness</strong> – If the instructor falls ill during the semester, there may be changes to this course, including having a backup instructor take over the course.
