    "VADER collects and scores negative, neutral, and positive words and features (and accounts for factors like negation along the way). The “neg”, “neu”, and “pos” values describe the fraction of weighted scores that fall into each category. VADER also sums all weighted scores to calculate a “compound” value normalized between -1 and 1; this value attempts to describe the overall affect of the entire text from strongly negative (-1) to strongly positive (1). In this case, the VADER analysis describes the passage as slightly-to-moderately negative (-0.3804). We can think of this value as estimating the overall impression of an average reader when considering the e-mail as a whole, despite some ambiguity and ambivalence along the way."
