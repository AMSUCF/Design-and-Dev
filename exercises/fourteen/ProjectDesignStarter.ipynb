    "- **Dependencies:** What modules will your project need?\n",
    "- **Collection:** Where is your data coming from?\n",
    "- **Processing:** How will you format and process your data?\n",

    "- **Visualization:** How will you visualize and explore your data?\n",

    "Don't worry if you aren't exactly certain how you would implement everything - this should be a starting point for a larger research study, but it doesn't need to be a complete, functional workflow. Aim for a \"good enough\" starting point that you can reference and extend for future work. \n",
