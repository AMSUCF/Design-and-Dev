AAAAACAAAAAQAAAAIAAAABgAAAAUAAAADAAAABgAAAAcAAAAKAAAACAAAAAoAAAACAAAACAAAAAcAAAAKAAAABAAAAAgAAAADAAAA","dtype":"int32","order":"little","shape":[3837]},"review":["Don't trust the critics, they are false. I've seen critics with lower ratings than a 70. Overall, the game is disappointing and lacking. False advertising, updates are lackluster, and the game is unplayable. It's buggy as well. Some sprites wouldn't load until 30 seconds later. 0/10.","The game is visually alright. However, it is quite horrible compared to other Animal Crossing games. Not only this, but the fact that it is marketed as relaxing throws me off. Animal Crossing is supposed to be fun, not relaxing. A very terrible title, and have got my refund two weeks ago.","I'm cool with the one island per console limitation, but its insane that progress in the game is restricted to what player one does. I recently started an island with my wife. What if my wife quits playing the game? Will I have to start over? Crazy.","It\u2019s a fun game, very reminiscent of the old Animal Crossing games. HOWEVER, the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn\u2019t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. Not even a second copy of the game will rectify this. The only way to rectify it is to buy another switch. Nintendo is being VERY GREEDY in limiting the game play like this. And for that reason, I give this game a 4.","\"One Dictator, Seven Slaves\" same-console multiplayer is a huge disappointment.  We bought this game to *share* it- one island, one screen, shared decisions and contribution,","To actually review this game I think you'll need two scores. The first score being the game when you are Citizen Representative (you booted up the game first) and the second score when you are an additional player.\r I was unlucky enough to boot the game second and am not a Citizen Representative and to be honest I stopped playing the game after two days. You always have a feeling you have an inferior game where you are nothing more than a character on someone's island. You don't get to name the island, you don't get to build the structures on the island and you don't get to contribute to most of the \"story\" which Animal Crossing has to offer.\r My brother who is the Citizen Representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop, but I feel ripped off. To me, this game deserves nothing more than a 1 out of 10, because I really cannot live with the fact that my game is limited. If you pay \u20ac60 for a game, you want to fully enjoy it. Now I just can't because of these restrictions.","My gf started playing before me. No option to create my own island and guys, being the 2nd player to start on a console SUCKS!!!! You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.","Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can\u2019t contribute and can only really gather resources. This limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows. I hope Nintendo fixes this.","While the game itself is great, really relaxing and gorgeous, i can't ignore one thing that ruins the whole experience for me and a lot of other people as seen by the different user reviews.\r That thing is that you only have 1 island per console. This decision limits to one person being able to enjoy the full experience. It also nukes any creative control of the island, since you have the other users\rhouse and furniture. I hope nintendo can soon fix this big issue, because for now, this killed any intentions i had to play the game.","Bought the game for my Girlfriend and me. The system that you can only have one island is absolutely **** Why Nintendo, why???? Destroyed so much fun for me..","The one island per console is pretty stupid, but I really enjoy the game. Probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same Switch but for me it's not too much of a problem. Really great way to unwind, the Nook Miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now. Kinda wish it wasn't locked to real time but mostly because I'm impatient. I can see myself logging a metric f-ton of time into this game. Good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through Hell in Doom Eternal.","My wife and I were looking forward to playing this game when it released. I bought it, I let her play first she made an island and played for a bit. Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do. So, if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game, you need two switches. Worst decision I have ever seen, this even beats EA.\rCongratulations Nintendo, you have officially become the worst video game company this year!","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE PLANNING TO PLAY ON ONE SWITCH.\rIf you do, there goes $60 down the drain. Only 1 island is allowed to be created per Switch, and if another player on the same Switch wants to play, they'll be a glorified visitor on the island, unable to make any decisions for the island, being restricted to do essentially nothing but build their own home. The game either needs to make the option of making multiple islands or give everyone on an island the option to be in control. My sister made an account first and unless I pay another $300 for a new Switch, I can't play the game. Such a disappointment, would rather have gotten DOOM.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great solo game that innovates and improves on most facets of the previous entries in the series and advertises that you can play with up to eight players on one island!\rOn the surface it sounds great, and it can be if you only want to play solo. This is a social game though, meant to be enjoyed by more than one person, and that experience is unfortunately ruined by some unbelievably poor design choices and limitations.\rThe only player who gets any real meaningful control over the island is the one who begins the game. They get to build villager's houses, place community buildings, etc. All players who come after them are treated like second-rate citizens, are given no control over virtually anything, and have a significantly diminished experience.\rThrough their failings, Nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game solo I suggest avoiding it.","BEWARE!  If you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account (island).  ONLY ONE customizable island can be played per Switch.  Even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize ONE island.  I have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island - AND THEY CANT!   This is absolutely unacceptable.  Maybe the dumbest thing Nintendo has ever done.  I have owned every Nintendo console since the original NES and I can not think of a worse decision by Nintendo.","The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is nonsensical. It\u2018s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles. This means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent. Player 2 can barely do anything, and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further. Player 2 can\u2019t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game.Sorry but this is an instant 0/10. The Switch is a family-oriented console and this is not a family-oriented game. This is a colossal failure on Nintendo\u2019s part.","I was very excited for this new installment of the Animal Crossing series. And I wish I could say that all the new bells and whistles and pretty graphics have made it the best ever. But Nintendo made the worst decision they could have possible made for this game.\r You can only have one island per SWITCH. Not per user profile. Not per Cartridge. Per SWITCH.\r This game is supposed to be Zen. It's not supposed to be the reason for a spike in domestic homicides. Having to share limited space with multiple family members competing for limited daily resources basically makes this game unplayable if, like a reasonable human, you only have one of these consoles in your family because they already have multiplayer support and you shouldn't need more than one for everyone to enjoy a game.\r Nintendo needs to patch this, or else refund every person that isn't a single person household with this game.","Only one island per console. The only way to get another is to buy another console I don\u2019t mind buying another copy of the game but another console is too much. I\u2019m leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart.","We need equal values and opportunities for all players on the island! My wife is the first player, which is great but I do not want to wait for her progress. At the same time, I do not want her to have a a second class player experience if I am the founder. Fix this Nintendo!!","I think it's a really enjoyable, addictive game. The graphics look really good, and doing chores for Tom Nook doesn't feel like it. The criticisms about one island per console are very valid, and understandably frustrating. I can see how families and couples would have a problem with it, though, even if it is something I do not. Just don't think that's worth giving it a zero. Anyways, buy at your own risk, but do your homework first","As a secondary island member, it is hard to rate this game more than a 1. This is my first time playing an Animal Crossing game. My spouse played first, establishing himself as the island representative. I quickly realized that this meant I have no ability to make any decisions about the island. Thankfully my spouse asks for my input when placing houses, musuem, etc..  But then I realized he also gets access to diy recipes that I don't and that the island doesn't progress if he doesn't progress it. I can't contribute to the building off houses! We have no problems sharing resources. We have divided the island in half and have been sharing... But I feel like I'm getting a watered down version of the game. I don't think I should have to buy a whole other switch just so I cna have my own island! It seems ridiculous and unfair. I can't even imagine having a family with children who all want to play. How do you decide who gets to be the decision maker? I am sad because I love the game, but I feel disappointed that I don't get to experience it in full because I'm not the primary player.","It's 2020 and for some reason Nintendo has decided that only one island is available per Switch console. Meaning my fianc\u00e9 cannot progress the game beyond what I have done since I started my game first. She cannot place buildings down. She cannot obtain better tools until I've done it myself. Why is she hamstrung? She has to have a lesser experience because of it. This is an utter joke and I expect my money back. I'm being pushed into buying a new console just so she can have the full experience. I will NOT be buying a whole new console just for that. This is shameful.","Having one island per console isn't even the worst part about this game. The fact that every other player - except the first person to boot up the game - cannot learn and perform more than 75% of the games functions is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. At this point Nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play AC at the same register as the island \"resident representative\" LOL. This issue is clearly a money grabbing scheme and could easily be avoided by either 1) allowing everyone to be 'resident representative, or 2) Giving each player the OPTION to either join someone else's island on their switch OR create their own island. This function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is BROKEN, and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics: Couples who share a switch, siblings who share a switch, a parent and a child who want to play together, Roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together.... you get my point. Hopefully it can be fixed because currently customers are very dissatisfied with the results.","This is so annoying. Only one player has the ability to play this game because only one island. Nintendo doesn't deserve my money anymore.","It seems all the negative reviews are about the fact that you can only have one island per system, regardless of how many users there are. If this isn't a problem then you, like me, will absolutely love this game. It's Animal Crossing - on the Switch. Things from the older games have been streamlined but it feels different enough to be a worthy sequel.\r The game looks gorgeous, the character customisation is at a series high, the villagers seem more alive than ever before, the progression is satisfying (albeit slow in the first few days), and all in all, the game is just fantastic. I'll be playing it for years, for sure.","I purchased this game for my household (me and my GF) and she started playing the game first. There was no advertisement or clear indication of this but each switch console is limited to one Island and the first person on that Island has a much better gaming experience than anyone else. Anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building, set any mandates, and cannot progress in the story (e.g. getting tools) until the owner of the island does. There are also restrictions on what the second player can put in the musuem. There is no reason for there not to be a second game file for each profile on the switch and Ninentdo attempt to push people to buy seperate consoles for this game is extremely greedy. Gameplay is actually great but the severe limitations and no forewarning leads me to post this review to tell people not to buy this game if more than one person will play on the switch.","The game is probably fine but you can't fully experience it if you are the second player on the same console. You are forced to live on the island of the player who first started the game. Even worse, you share resources. So player one collects all fruits, insects etc. and you stand there with nothing. This has to be the worst game design decision ever made. Until that is fixed I cannot play and therefore not recommend the game. Shame on you Nintendo. Thats not family friendly at all.","they heavily marketed this game as a social experience. a game to share with your friends and family. but heres the catch, you will need 1 nintendo switch for each player to get the full experience. I bought the game to share it with my girlfriend but the first player is considered as the FOUNDER of the island, and he is the one that will progress the story, that will unlock stuff and do all the cool things. The second nintendo switch profile will act merely as a villager, with little to no impact on the game and not able to progress without the founders progress. Game ruined by greed, want to have the full experience? BUY 2 PHYSICAL COPIES AND 2 NINTENDO SWITCHES, yeah thats what nintendo requires of you to play a social game if you want to be social.","The game is awesome, but the limit of one island per console means that only one person in my family actually gets to enjoy the game in its entiretyEveryone else is limited in what they can do, and they all take a supporting role. Disappointed to be honest. The game would be perfect if each profile could choose between joining an existing island or creating their own. Unfortunately, this is the only way I can protest","Nintendo made this game so that only one person per console can get the full experience and it disappointing to say the least.","One island per console is a pretty terrible and greedy design choice by Nintendo. Whoever is first on the island gets the full game experience and everyone else is gimped and cannot progress or do the same things.","Retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements, such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside. These factors contribute to an excellent amount of customisation and ensure that I will be playing for years to come.\r I have two complaints with this new entry though. The first is the crafting mechanic. While scavenging for materials to build things ranging from tools to furniture is interesting initially, the novelty wears off quickly and it becomes a chore. This is especially evident with tools constantly breaking. The second complaint is the lack of cloud saving, giving me no current way to back up my save data.","You can only create one island per switch and anyone else that joins the island literally cannot progress until the person who created it does. Greedy Nintendo at it again.","Only ONE island per console!\r You can't create a different island per user/account.\rOnce you have created an island on your console, all users have to share it.\rGood luck if you have two or more kids...\r Nintendo got away with forcing us to buy one game per user for years and years with Pokemon and Animal Crossing, and now they want us to buy one CONSOLE per user. They had the \"excuse\" of lack of memory space with cartridges, but with the Switch, there is literally NO GOOD REASON to do that but CORPORATE GREED.\r That kind of practice shouldn't be allowed.\rSeriously, shame on you Nintendo!","You can only have one island per Switch. If multiple people play on the same system, you\u2019ll be tied to whoever started the first game\u2019s island. Kinda kills any sort of independence.","Why add local co op if you can only do one island and not have an option to split screen?","Forcing there to only be 1 island per account completely ruins multiplayer for any family or residents that share a switch. The only way to enjoy this with your family is purchasing multiple switches, and that's completely ridiculous. There's no reason not to have the option of starting a new Island. Just shady business. The game is fun, unfortunately, not everyone who lives on the island will get to experience that.","Though advertised as multiplayer most in game actions are unnecessarily locked to the first person that starts the game. The poor design decisions include, but are not limited to:1) There is no mechanical reason for only one person to be allowed to craft certain items. This not only applies to larger projects such bridges, but also smaller diy recipes are only gifted to the first player. 2) You canot travel to other islands or invite friends to your island while playing co-op. (Not only online functions but the in game deserted islands too.)3) Rather than create a co-op inventory system they opted to be lazy and limit it to the leader only. Other items are teleported to a shared inventory.4) Another minor issue with co-op is the controls for swapping tools changes depending on whether you're the leader or not. This is obviously a minor gripe, but annoying none the less. &amp; completely  unnecessary.5) The most annoying thing about these issues is that they're the result of poor design choices and laziness.","YES, the game starts slowly, but by day 3, I have had so much to do, I don't know what to do with all my time!  This is exactly the game the world needs right now.  Highly recommended, 10/10.","Perfect for one player. Coop sucks, but what KILLS the game is that you can essentially only have one player PER SWITCH. Your SO/sibling/kid will have to play on YOUR island on YOUR profile.I cannot think of a single other home console game with this limitation. Not being able to share this with my family makes it a return.","If more than one person plays on a Switch, even with seperate profiles you are forced to share not only the island but all the resources as well.  Anyone playing on a file after the first person to create a file is extremely limited as well.  It is an absolute nightmare to play with more than one person.","Cant stop playing!","It's absolutely ridiculous that the 5 members of my family that all share a switch have to only have one island. And on top of that the first person is the boss. You have really let me down Nintendo and hope you get this fixed. Also how is there no cloud save??? Welcome to 2020","Alright, so first things first the game itself is alright, HOWEVER, if you have more than one person in your household only the FOUNDER will be able to enjoy it as supposed to. Not only you can not have multiple islands (not even sure how to react on that in 2020), but also the first player gets all proper interactions, quests etc. If you share a console other players will be limited to the progress of player 1.\r But what's worse is a local coop, the second player is basically a slave of the main one without inventory and even being able to proper pick-up stuff (so you have to jump around the main player for usual exchange). Not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground (like \"hey I found this\") especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth. Also, the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu.\r Also, small things like not being able to rotate the camera or change the location of the tent are annoying.\r IDK to it seems like Nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth. Disappointed.","I like many people and  across several platforms, share my switch with my partner. practically  Locking the game to one user per console is absolutely disgusting. That's all ther is to say.","Updating my review - sharing a single island stinks, and I wish both of us in our house could have an island to place things where we wished, however my previous low review was a bit too harsh.  The additional islands make resource sharing easy, so at least both of us can play the game.  I really wish Nintendo would push out an update to allow saving 1 island per user account though ...","It totally sucks that you can only have one island per switch. My boyfriend tried to make an island of his own.....BUT NO. So now he get to sit beside and just watch me play.Do it again and do it right Nintendo.","It's absolutely amazing, gorgeous looking game, tons of stuff to do, you'll never run out of thing to do.","One island per console ruined the game for me. After my girlfriend set up the island, I realized I'm basically a guest in her island for pretty much anything now. It's not even proper sharing - she's the owner and I'm her guest in the Island.\r I'll just let her play the game on her own and I'll play something else instead.","This game is just further proof that Nintendo refuses to understand what people want from an online experience. Only one island, combined with whoever leads gets all the items picked up. Bottom line is if your not leading your not progressing.","A good game, for sure, but only 1 Island. With this limitation, to keep the interest longer, only my wife play.Half the payer, half the rating. I Hope a change soon","First of all I want to admit that yeah, it\u2019s true single console multiplayer options are terrible. The second character gets dumbed down to a sort of follower that can only be in the shadow of the main player. Truth is tho that this feature has been true of New Leaf as well. If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn\u2019t mayor and didn\u2019t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn\u2019t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don\u2019t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game. It can\u2019t be enjoyed by all, but for those that are planning to play solo, go for it, there is so much to get out of this experience!!","Same-console multiplayer is severely limited. The game was designed so that only one person per family can actually get the full experience. Do NOT buy this game if you want to play with multiple people.","The game is broken bugged right out the get go. I started a game,progressed my Island, etc. Later in the day, my wife gets on the family console to play, and is totally confused. The game only allows one person to play it on a console, the other profiles can only get a severely stripped down version of your island. No way to have their own profile. Some fanboys claim this was on purpose, but I cant imagine Nintendo would make this big of a mistake on purpose. Once this huge bug gets fixed, I'm happy to reevaluate the score, but this is a solid 0/10 for blocking other players from playing beyond the first to start a game on the console.","Unplayable for more than one child.\rSet up in such a way that it's pretty much unplayable outside of singleplayer. You have to buy a whole other switch and game if you want peace and quiet out of kids playing. Dirty practise from a company renowned for making family games.\rOutside of the cash gouging, very little of the game mechanics is explained, especially if you're the second person to jump in and try to play.\rItems are trapped behinds arbitrary walls put in place by Tom nook, in single player, that's frustrating, the resources needed for multiple people to achieve this kinda makes it somewhat miserable to play.\rSure, it's cute, sure the music is nice, but you can get all of that from the old games\r I think the scores of ten are coming from people treating this as a sacred cow...","Im Currently 18 hours in, with over 2 months worth of time skips. Game seems worse than its predecessors, Overall its a fun experience, but its limited in ways that i can only believe are to allow more copies to be sold before people can see the lack of content. Im on my 4th house expansion with a town of 6, shop upgraded. And it seems like im at the end of the museum collection. The little things that made the previous games feel special are missing, while new mechanics are in place to create a facade of advancement. Tons of things are missing from previous games that have become staples. Removal of the stat system for catches also removes half of the excitement of catching the same stuff over and over since you cant get a New best because size simply no longer exists. Controls could have been improved alot for this game, There are no touch functions despite having alot of use in many areas, such as home design and patterns or basic inventory management. Information is sparse. The game expects you to understand what your doing and why your doing it with zero direction for majority of the game. Honestly if this was any other game it would score much lower and i haven't even gotten into the multiplayer aspect both locally and online.","Forced to play on same island as roommate who logs on first everyday.....I get minimal resources, and they get to decide every house and building location. WASTE OF MONEY.","For those who are not familiar to the animal crossing franchise, Animal Crossing is a life stimulation game where you take your time to relax and explore your island as well as forming friendship with the villagers while doing outdoor activities such as bug catching and fishing.\r As for New Horizons the game is just pleasant to play. The control feels right, there's more events to do, the atmosphere is much more lively and what's more with the addition of terraforming allows players to build new path or destroying the edge of a cliff in their island to how they see fits. Veterans of the animal crossing franchise fans will most likely appreciate all these new addition to the games.\r The games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well. Nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you can't have multiple islands on the same console. It also restricted other profile users in your switch to perform activities in the island if you're not the owner of the island. Therefore New Horizon single player aspect is fun and all but if you're looking for a co-op experience this game does really poorly on that aspect.","my girls were so excited to get this game. I read nothing about because it doesn't interest me. Once they started playing it they realised that there was only one island per switch, and my god, do they hate that!!! My girls are years apart and what appeals to one doesnt appeal to the other.\r This limitation feels arbitrary and ill thought out.\r I hope a patch fixes this","It's immensely disappointing to purchase the game and learn that there is very little value for a family. Whereas I can share my other games with my children, the fact that only one of us can make true progress in the game is a letdown and just another example of Nintendo being completely tone deaf and out of touch.\r Beyond this, though, the fact that few reviewers discuss this fact is abhorrent. The game simply does not deserve the praise it is receiving from the media in the face of such a glaring misstep, highlighting their own massive blind spots.\r At this point, while an okay but slow game, in the face of its price and the limitations its value drops far below far more mediocre games that are at least enjoyable more broadly.","i'll update my review as I play. but mannnn this game is boring.\r2 hours into the game and I got a house... that's all I feel like I accomplished. Games are supposed to bring some short of enjoyment, whether it be story, graphics or gameplay... This has none of that so far.... Just kill me now please.......","An awesome Animal Crossing Experience. Being able to build out your island the way you like is an awesome feature. It's almost like having a crossover episode between Minecraft and Animal Crossing.\r The only negative is the one Island per console. If we could have even one per User I would have given this game a higher score.","Alright game I guess, but it\u2019s very lacking. I can\u2019t give it a good rating due to the lack of content we get in updates. We got Rover on a cliff now. Rover used to be more memorable in the OG (Original GCN) game than a May Day Event. I am disappointed in this game. I didn\u2019t give it a 0, because the storyline was good and should have continued. They could\u2019ve made New Horizons a side-story game if it weren\u2019t for three things. The NookPhone (and the whole \u201cmodernization\u201d thing) and the sequel references, (because it would take place before them) and the most important thing: MORE STORYLINE! I know Animal Crossing  isn\u2019t supposed to be a story mode game, but New Horizons feels like it\u2019s supposed to be that way.","I'm just not getting all of the hype with this game. I'm REALLY disappointed with this game. I expected to find some type of cool island with buildings and structures, as shown in commercials, but there's nothing there. It's misleading. I was told to play previous games. So, you what I did? I replaced the game. I said I wanted the 3DS version instead. They gave me the 3DS version and $30 credit. (since it cost only $30) I had a New Nintendo 2DS XL for games like Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3DS (The 3D one, I have the 2D one, too), Miitopia, and Tomodachi Life. I like the Tomodachi Life game, and it was similar, so what the heck, I gave Animal Crossing 3DS a try. I do not regret it, and find it to be the BEST decision I ever made. They had BUILDINGS! It had LIFE! I enjoyed 3DS, 10 TIMES BETTER, in the FIRST DAY, than Animal Crossing Switch ever did, in THREE DAYS! I may do a review on Animal Crossing 3DS in the future, but it's too early to decide yet. Heck, many critics reviewed the game too early! Why count any of the critics before the release date? I would give Animal Crossing Switch a 1, but I can't. I did not have any fun, except for the airport thing, which the train thing was a huge improvement over the Switch version, so I can't even give it a 1. I will give it a 4/100 (0.4/10), because it was playable, at the beginning.","There is a 75 character minimum for reviews. If your review contains spoilers, please check the Spoiler box.

It makes you wanna get out, out of this trap of a game. It's not good. It has ruined last year, and this year. When we found out a New Animal Crossing game was coming out, we were excited. We each had humble hopes. Ever since that 2019 announcement, I was dreaming of an amazing town to play in. But, when the trailer for New Horizons came out, our hopes were not as high. We were debating whether to get the game. We all agreed that we didn't like the whole NookPhone thing, but we still had hopes. We were excited March, but slowly but surely, it became worse. When April came along, so did Bunny Day. UGH! That was STUPID and didn't make me want to play the game! I started getting bored around mid-April, slowly but surely decreasing my rating. May was alright, and then we realized how repetitive it was. My friend didn't appreciate the game as we wanted it to be. As the months went by, everyone, including me started to not like the game. It became a bad game. It became so repetitive, we couldn't even play a minute. It's a waste now. Some new features are alright, but I can't give this any more than a 3/10. It's not a 0, we kind of enjoyed the game at first. Even the updates couldn't save the game... The updates are horrible and repetitive. They don't fix the game, and never will. No matter how many updates they release, it will never fix the game. As a long time Animal Crossing fan, I am disappointed. Many long-time Animal Crossing fans are disappointed in this game. Even people who don't play Animal Crossing will eventually find New Horizons repetitive. Whatever the case, I suggest people do not get the game. You may find it alright for a few hours, but after that, prepare to be disappointed. If you want to be introduced to Animal Crossing, we suggest an older game, but not the spin-offs. I think this should represent the issues that people think of this game. Oh, and the hourly music. Oh my... it's bland. It does not represent Animal Crossing music, and feels extremely bland, especially in the first month. It makes you want to turn off the music entirely. That's another issue I forgot to mention. The music! I remember playing, and the music... is boring. Now I think that's everything to include in my opinions, along with my friends opinions. It's a disappointment.","Bought this game to relax and feel free.Bad choice. All the game you are in debt and tom nook take all the credit for the work you do.VERY basic and repetitive.The character will tell their intro lines EVERYTIME you talk to them. Grindy AF","Animal Crossing in name and villagers only.  This game is missing so much and is so incomplete.  They sold it under the promise that there would be meaningful updates which they have failed to deliver on.  The only content updates were parts of the game that were not quite complete when the game released such as diving or the museum/ artwork, but it was obvious they were supposed to be in the game as people could glitch into the water to swim and the spot for Redd to show up was already there.  What the hell did they do with the extra six months they took after the first release date before actually releasing?  Meanwhile they add a few clothing/ furniture items every month and boldly call it a \"free update\".  Where's the coffee shop, shampoodle, fortune teller, GYROIDS FFS, store upgrades, shoe shop, gracies, mini games, etc etc etc.  If it wasn't severely time gated then the main story would have been done in a day if that.  What a rip off and blatant lie to their promise.  The only reason I gave it a 2 was I did enjoy what little of the game there was.  New Leaf was 10x the game. Pretty typical of Nintendo and their over-glorified mobile tablet now.","I was very excited for this game and when I got it I was hooked. But that feeling only lasted a few weeks and after that I put down the game and didn't pick it back up. Enjoyed it but thought the wonderful experience would last longer. Eventually you'll get bored.","I'm so torn on this game. It's fun for a while, but you can't stop playing or you're punished. The menus are so long and tedious. Only the first player can do certain stuff on your island. You can only have one island. The game has missing content from New Leaf that is slowly added back.\r I was going to give this a 5 at first, but I'm just now realizing how much this game hates it's players. 4 it is.","Let me first start off saying I'm a huge AC fan. With that being said, wtf happen nintendo? It's been past a year now and their updates are pure garbage in comparison to what New Leaf provided.  The characters don't have any life to them, if you have more than one personality type prepare to read the same dialogue again and again. This is unavoidable dude to you being allowed 10 villagers max and there being only 8 personality types in the game. I'm really frustrated and confused as to why I'm paying for Nintendo online membership to utilize the games island backup service but if I ever wanna restore my island save I need to contact Nintendo support and have them hold my hand though the process. Long story short get the game play for a year or buy new leaf and have fun.","This shouldn\u2019t be called New Horizons since there\u2019s nothing good in this game. I don\u2019t believe it. What is this garbage? It\u2019s a time-waster, in a bad way. You get bored quickly. There\u2019s only three songs in this game. THREE SONGS! The title theme, the outside theme, and the shopping tent theme. WHAT IS THIS? You get two villagers and they don\u2019t help you with progress. I quit this game. I wanted to throw my controller into the TV and destroy the island! Luckily I got a refund, but it was a hassle!","Initially, I could not put down this game. I spent two weeks after getting a \"4-star\" island rating trying to raise it to 5 but... I hate it now. I hate the way my island looks and feels. I look to other player's 5-star islands and it is not my jam. I've ruined so much of the natural beauty of my secluded island to please Isabelle, but she's never satisfied. Can't even start a fresh island without deleting all my progress. Do I really want to back to a time when I only had one outfit?","It's a good game with beautiful graphics but it gets quite boring after some time and it just doesn't grip me as New Leaf did.","This empty, life-less husk of a game is an insult to the name Animal Crossing. Out of hundreds of NPCs with rich, vibrant (and seemingly unending) dialogue, New Horizons gives us a handful who say something different a grand total of one time a day. How anyone who was a real animal crossing fan did not immediately storm this developer\u2019s headquarters and spit on their placard is beyond my understanding. Go look at your town. It\u2019s very pretty, fancy, and oh-so- Minecraft????  Customization is great but these NPCs (a large part of what made the older games so fun) have no soul. I\u2019m sure marketing made a great pitch for online play and yadda-yadda but how no one brought up the fact that this game is primarily going to pique the attention of a niche audience who has been waiting for years and who did not go ga-ga for online play (mostly because it largely didn\u2019t exist on this platform) is also baffling. I hope that future updates will fix this glaring issue but fear that even the most honed necromancy will not have the juice to bring our islands to life.","I bought this game as a joint venture for me and and son, as it's been raved for its help against mental illness. My son turns out not to be interested in the game. He would sooner play Minecraft but he has start the world and is the king user.Myself and my wife are player two and three.. effectively visitors on our sons island. We can't progress in the game. Can't move forward with the story or anything it's like we're on a limited trial version of the game.. The only way round this apparently is to buy a second or third switch!  Which frankly is completely unacceptable! Nintendo and the animal crossing team need to fix this asap.","I love Animal Crossing, but this game just feels like a let down.\r Visually, this game looks FANTASTIC. There are so many small details that affect the world around you like the wind speed, how trees and other objects look in the rain, the sounds of different kinds of shoes walking across the ground, it\u2019s great.\r Terraforming is nice, putting furniture outside is cool, and crafting is a fun idea. I actually really love how this game starts out. I love that each day the island is growing, you get new items, and meet new characters as they slowly come to your island. But I feel like after this \u201ctutorial\u201d ends, I don\u2019t really want to play anymore. In New Leaf your always building up stuff even after the beginning. I feel like New Horizons just stops in giving you major reasons to play the game.\r Villagers are also a major issue. I never feel like actually interacting with a villager anymore. If I do I just mash the A button barely processing what the villager is saying because they\u2019ve already said this exact thing a million times before. They just aren\u2019t interesting to talk to. I also hate that when you give them items, they seemingly always accept it. This behavior just comes off as so fake to me that I don\u2019t like it. Please just say \u201cno, this isn\u2019t my style\u201d or something. Animals clearly have preference as sometimes they\u2019ll wear the clothing you give them and other times they\u2019ll wear it one time and just place it in there house the next day to never be used again.\r I also find that furniture sets have less variety. So many items have been removed from New Leaf, it\u2019s sad. Speaking of which, why did they completely cut gyroids from this game??? I thought before New Horizons that they would never remove Gyroids because they were in every single Animal Crossing game beforehand. But yet, here we are.\r Also why is there only one shop upgrade? Seriously? And this can be done in like 1 month... Also why is Mable the only one to get a store, what about Kicks and Leif? Couldn\u2019t they have been a similar thing to how Mable worked?\r When this game can out, it was SUPER bare bones. Though this game was heavily reliant on updates for content... so okay I guess. Until you realize that most of the updates focus on some one day event that has already been in the previous Animal Crossings game. It\u2019s disappointing how much new content were in these updates.\r As many people have described New Horizons as a Happy Home Designer sequel. And that\u2019s really what this game is. It focuses a lot on customization. But that\u2019s not really my favorite feature. It\u2019s the villagers. New Leaf didn\u2019t really have the best villagers. I thought, \u201cthey can\u2019t get any worse right? They can only get better.\u201d\r Well... guess my \u201chopes\u201d were too high.\r This game is fine on its own but Animal Crossing has been separating the main theme it started from, which is \u201cfamily, friendship and community.\u201d","My husband and I decided to get it, because we both love animal crossing. Since my husband bought it, he started first. He's been playing it a few days, and I went to start my island when he wasn't playing. Guess what? I can't. You LITERALLY CANNOT HAVE TWO ISLANDS ON ONE SWITCH. Are you kidding? Just because my husband started the game, now I can never have my own without spending hundreds of dollars on another game console? That is absolutely ridiculous. Now I will never be able to actually play the game, since he has already started the town and is now in charge of all the decisions. I am beyond furious.","No cooking/eating in a game like this? Horrendous. Animal Crossing: New Horizons sports a disappointing amount of content, absolutely unrepresentative of its steep price tag. Don't get me started with that one island per console and severe limitations on other users hogwash. I've never seen save files handled on any game as badly as this; not to mention this is a first-party title on a console, which makes it even worse.","I really like this game, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement I have played just about all of the AC titles at this point and this in my opinion is the second best (New Leaf first).\r-There is a big lack of variety in dialogue with the villagers in the sense talking to them more than 2x per day gets them all mad and complain that the island is not big enough for the two of you.\r-Not enough buildings. As of right now there are only 2 shops and all other NPC's only visit once in awhile on unpredictable schedules.\r-What is the point of Isabelle announcements at the start of each day if she's not going to tell me when I have visitors like Sahara or Celeste just to name a few. I have defintely missed days with them on my island simply because I did not know they were here.\r-Rugs sold from Sahara cannot be placed outdoors, why bother buying these if they can only be placed in my house when they would go PERFECTLY with the furniture I set up outside? Big opportunity missed there...\r-Buying clothing from the Able Sisters shop is so time consuming, especially if I'm visiting someone else's island in the sense that I can only purchase one type of clothing at a time (ex buying the same shirt in multiple colors, I have to enter and exit the changing room several times). If there are other people waiting to use the single changing room available, it really slows everyone down.\r-The crafting / DIY setup is really great, but I'd like to be able to craft multiple items at a time and have my in home work bench connect to what's in storage in home. Having all the materials in my pockets and trying to craft just takes up too much space (even with fully expanded inventory).\r This seems like a long list of complaints, but the good really does outweigh the bad!","Once again I was allured to Animal Crossing more than ever, it was fun, it was great, but soon, slowly but truly its charm disappeared a fair amount.\r I'm not a fan of review bombing, but I'm surely counting negative aspects that a lot of people are complaining about, if not for them, this review will be easily a 9 or so, but as it is, I believe a 7 is a fair score, without further ado my thoughts are as follows:\r Starting with the positive things, NH is as ever an incredible time if you're up to the task of giving your heart to it, long gone are those days when you could only customize your house, now the full island has customization, and almost every furniture or item is placeable wherever you want, and it gives a lot of freedom and customization. As it was in New Leaf where you could make public structures, like arches or statues, now they're just items like it should have from a long time ago. Another good addition is its new point system called 'Nook Miles' in which you have to meet certain requirements like achievements and you'll be rewarded with miles, this system comes as unique achievements and a daily wheel of minor achievements that can be done over and over, in contrast with past entries where at a certain point you simply turn off the game because you didn't have more things to do for that day, these miles can be exchanged for several things like furniture, clothes or unique DIY recipes, this new mechanic in form of DIY is easily one of the most enjoyable things in NH, they come as gifts from villagers, message bottles, rewards, etc, the fun part is that you need certain items to make them, so a lot of your time will be invested in acquiring items to make your recipes, pure joy.\r By far, the best thing that NH has to offer is terraforming, although it has its limitations, it's easily the most entertaining addition: do you want to make your island like a crater? maybe a fortress? or how about a city? the limit is your determination and creativity (and maybe at times money), but it surely is the thing that a lot of veterans were waiting, think of it as a Minecraft ripoff, but with Animal Crossing makeover.\r As for the negatives, there are a lot of issues that can be resumed into 4 main problems, at least to me, they weren't a problem at first but everything went a little downhill once you notice them. First and the most common issue for everyone is the one island per switch, when the official trailer launched and stated that this game will be multiplayer with a common island I was really into, I and my partner were daydreaming about the things and possibilities of playing co-op, turns out that the local multiplayer is more a gimmick and the second player is basically a background PC, although the biggest issue is that the only the 1st resident can advance through the \"main quest\" so good luck if your 1st resident is not as active as you. The second issue is its online mode, if you're playing with one friend is just serviceable, but if you're going to play with two or more persons (friends or internet people) you'll notice that every single time a person arrives or leaves your island, every player that is in the island have to watch an unskippable (quite long) cutscene, not only that, for some unthinkable reason, you can't navigate through menus or inventory in that particular moment, otherwise, the cutscene will be delayed. this is a serious problem particularly if you're planning to play this with several friends or if you're into the stalk market, prepare to loose 15-20 min per arrival.\r My third issue is more a quality of life issue, you see, Animal Crossing have ever being a game about of time, you have to wait a lot in order to have the best of it, but, at this point, selling, buying and navigating through menus is quite a burden, not only that, there are too many nitpicks to list in here, but, certainly it seems more like the game is keeping you away from having fun, is not like there aren't a lot of things to do, so it feels more like cheap padding than anything.\r The last issue and the one that I hate the most and it seems that no one is talking about, is its \"free updates\", when the first official trailer launched with its terraforming promises, it also mentioned something that bothered me a lot, the fact its main events will arrive as free updates as if they need to be charged or something, in past entries these seasonal events wherein the main game, so it feels way too worrisome that now they're extra, if this game was a MMO or online specific, I wouldn't mind but, it's more like I paid full price for a game that is not finished, so if you're like me and want to play this game in some years, good luck finding those \"free updates\".\r If you took your time to read this whole thing, I appreciate it a lot, even if you agree or not, I like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but, is important to address its issues.","This game and what is behind it is honestly appalling. Of course there's the one-island-per-console thing, which is terrible, but the game itself is just not what the Animal Crossing series is supposed to represent. The villagers have been completely sidelined and now do nothing to contribute to the game, repeating the same happy-go-lucky lines over and over. What happened to the sass? The gossip? And what happened to being part of a community? Now the main focus is showing off your island, but the game can't even do that right because of the horrible quality of life, such as the aforementioned island limitation as well as every minute task taking forever to do. Post-launch support has been revolting, and a year later this game still lacks most of the content of the previous titles. The developers refuse to listen to any gripes players may have, and do the bare minimum to constitute the game being $60, because they don't have to care because of how well this game sold. If you like the Animal Crossing series please DO NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS GAME.","The customization is aight, but Nintendo needs to be held accountable for **** practices in this game. Less content than New Leaf, one island per Switch, and everything is so bland and dull after playing for a little bit","The game has good graphics....that's all you can say about this \"game\". If you can call it \"game\"....The Villagers don't have any personality, The dialogues are repetitive, The Events are really boring and the Updates are empty and just not good. I have over 1000 hours in the game but only because i started a new Island everytime it got boring. We NEED gameplay new dialogues, more personality!!! NO New objects","if i was writing this review a year ago this game would\u2019ve been at a 9 or even 10 as i and a bunch of other fans were promised updates to the game that would add new features however a year later this game feels less like a 60$ game and more like an e3 demo, we\u2019ve only gotten a handful of updates most of which were watered down features that were already in the base game of previous entries, lackluster \u201cevents\u201d or random (tiny) furniture that no one has asked for we haven\u2019t received a proper quality of life update or any major updates that added new or even old features except 2 both of which were last year meanwhile animal crossing pocket camp (a free mobile game) receives  updates way more frequently and almost each one includes exciting furniture sets, this game is an absolute let down from the high that was new leaf and it\u2019s sad to see such a great series  produce such a boring  experience","Why is there crafting in an Animal Crossing game? This isn't a Minecraft-style game! STOP\u00a0STEALING FROM MINECRAFT NINTENDO! There are corporations now that are even more selfish than EA, including you Nintendo. This is the worst game ever made, and Nintendo should be embarrassed of themselves. It makes no difference to me whether it gets a Metacritic score of 90! That's a lie! Nintendo most likely paid them to choose only the positive reviews and one mixed review for the game. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING REASONABLE! Customers complain about most games in a variety of ways, and the way Metacritic does that is unrealistic and does not make sense. Metacritic, please do your research! This game will always, and forever be a 0/10.","This opinion on the game is without including the new updates!\r I hated this game for one reason: It absolutely wastes your time in every aspect of the game.\rWhy can't I craft multiple items of one type at once?\rWhy is the inventory so limited from the start?\rWhy are there always so many clicks you have to do for everything?\rAlso, Nintendo. Why can't I cloud save this game? I would like to uninstall it and come back to it later once there are quality of life updates, but I still have to have the icon on my switch no matter what? That just seems wrong.\r Verdict: This game would be great with enough quality of life updates. As it stands tho it's a giant waste of time.\r Rating:\rGameplay: 1/5 - Time wasting\rLevel Design: 4/5 - Great looking islands with nice exploration.\rSoundtrack: 5/5 - Fantastic\rStory: 2/5 - Everything this game needs, but nothing special\rGraphics: 5/5 - Beautiful.\rLength: 5/5 - As long as you want to. Played it for 30 hours and was still on the start of the game.\rReplay Value: 2/5 - There's no real reason to start over again since you'll repeat everything just with other characters on your island.\rEnjoyment: 1/5 - It just got frustrating the more I played.\r Overall rating: 25/40 =&gt; 6.25/10 =&gt; 6/10","Lacking in content, frustrating menus, boring and bland villager dialogue, updates that add cut content from older games so it really isn\u2019t new stuff","Look, this is a very cute and diverting game. I got it when it came out even though I had never played another AC game before, though I have put many hours into Stardew Valley so I thought it would be a good fit. Then the pandemic came and I got into it especially at the beginning. Didn't even time travel until late May or so. I've bred all the varieties of flowers, collected all the fossils in the museum and just finished getting all the artwork too (I'm not some sucker that's going to not TT and wait 3 frigging years of real life to get all the art), terraformed my island several times over, so it's not like I don't appreciate what is in the game. The problem is the seeming hatred Nintendo's programmers have for the players of this game. Talking to Gulliver or Gullivarr, you literally have to hit the A button almost 20 times to get through the dialogues to get your task from them. This is similar for interactions with EVERY NPC that isn't an island villager. Why does Kicks even come to islands? He never sells anything worth having and that's just one more day until you can get some useful like Redd on the island. Crafting DIYs is a pain. I gave up crafing bait probably back in July, once I had caught all the fish available to that point. IF I ever pick up the game again (and it's less likely every day), I will never craft bait again OR terraform again. Terraforming is one island pixel/cell at a time. Like everything in this game, it is beyond tedious. This isn't so much a game as a part-time job and about as enjoyable after the shine wears off. I'm to the point where I cringe every time I hear the Isabelle music when starting up the game, then close my eyes and hit the A button until she's done saying nothing... again.\r Back to the villagers... so boring. It's like you're supposed to talk to them every day, but when you do 9 times out of 10 they say the EXACT same thing they said yesterday. Reading online about how the villagers have been dumbed down and made nicer since the earlier games makes it seem like a really poor choice. When you get to the late game - having plenty of bells in your account and upgrading the house and shops to the max, and having the villagers you want - there's NO reason to go to other islands with Nook Miles Tickets. I now have about 150,000 NMs and NOTHING to spend them on. And I have a few achievements left to earn more but they are grindy AF and it would take me another 100 or 200 hours to get them (I'm ashamed to say I've played this over 500 hours, but I blame that on the pandemic). Not interested.\r To sum up: It's a pretty game with no soul and in the end, will bore the cr*p out of you.","While I understand why people like this game... it's just not for me. I just couldn't keep playing it, and I just ended up moving on to other games. To me there just wasn't a whole lot to do, and every time you thought you were doing something cool you would have to wait a day for it, and don't even get me started on the menuing... Honestly, my favorite part of the game was catching bugs and fish, and while I can see why people like this game, it was just boring to me. My advice: wait for a big sale, or even better, just buy Stardew Valley.","This is the first review I have written. Im not normally one to write reviews although I depend on them for all purchases. AC is not a bad game but while others find it enjoyable, I find it more of a chore with Nintendo forcing me to play the game the way they want.\r 1) One island per switch is annoying. This tied with the fact that only ONE person can do things like move / build bridges, stairs, &amp; housing plots makes it extremely annoying when the island \"rep\" stops playing. Also, my partner &amp; I have different tastes &amp; playstyles. Forcing one island per switch was a terrible idea (but im sure they just wanted to force people to buy more Switches)\r 2) Load times are LONG. Breath of the wild, which is more intensive and large then this game, loads up in like half the time.  One of the biggest reasons I dont play anymore, is  because it just takes so long to get into the game and do the daily tasks.\r The amount of dialog you have to sit through repeatedly + lack of bulk crafting added to the load times adds up.\r 3) Outside of events, the game is pretty stale. The amount of villagers keeps things interesting but after a week you heard all of Isabelle's basic greetings. Your person says the same cringy line EVERY TIME you find a fossil, catch a fish, ect.","I play solo so I don't care about the 1 island per console thing, and it's been done to death already so let's talk about the game's other glaring flaws.\r - The dialogue is repetitive and uninteresting across the board. It makes me want to skip NPC text and makes villagers feel like decorations rather than actual people.\r- Early game progression is so linear. Your early villagers are selected from 2 personality pools rather than from all villagers.\r- The music is very forgettable outside of the K.K. Slider songs (which arguably don't count due to all but 4 of them returning from previous games) and the main theme.\r- There's only 1 shop upgrade, despite the older titles having 4 upgrades.\r- Content is drip fed through updates rather than being available from the start, which brick walls you if you finish the new content too fast.\r- So many classic NPCs are gone for no reason.\r- Crafting is cumbersome and feels unneeded after a while.\r- The whole game feels like it's focused on being a sandbox instead of a life sim.\r Seriously, if you have a 3DS, buy New Leaf instead. It's better in basically every way and is significantly cheaper. Or just emulate the older ones","this game SUCKS the whole game to me is boring im so bored when i play i try to get far but i cant without being bored I love new leaf and i was dissapointed when i played new horizons and i was glad to see that i can place stuff outside but the stuff is to expensive i cant get bells fast enough i don't see enough rare bugs and fish so i cant get enough then they added swimming but that boring i want to decorate that is my favorite thing to do but its to expensive as i said also crafting is useless like i never use it its also so annoying how it requires some stuff that is sometimes like 20 gold nuggets and sometimes like 5 stone i just hate the game","This game is virtually an alpha version of what i'm sure they planed. Are the bones of a promissing game, but as any alpha, it can barely be considered as a game. Boring after the first hours, all the good critics this game recived are the resoult of Nintendo paying more atention to buy good reviews than to the developement itself. Sad to see how this beloved saga suffered such degeneration thanks to the new Nintendo politics, cheap companny, cheap game.","The game lacks over half of features from previous releases and passes infinitesimal updates as actual content update. Lackluster and disappointing. Play New Leaf for a propper Animal Crossing.","Well, the director of this entry is the director of Happy Home Designer. That is why game feels more like a HHD sequel than a new Animal Crossing entry.... I loved this franchise but they literally removed everything that made AC charming, for what?? For being able to terra-form and decorate my island? This game is supposed to be a life-simulator, not a decorating game :/ Big let down! Also they promised us 3 years of updates, the first updates were nice but then the updates turned into adding the festivals and 3 items... wow! If the current director will also be the director of the next game, I am going to say goodbye to this franchise.","Game abandoned, lack of content missing from previous games like npcs shop upgrades, 100s of iconic furniture items which make up themed sets gone, no mini games to enjoy with friends like Tortimer island, villagers are empty with poor range of dialogue you can't have them visit you absolutely nothing, breakable golden tools, I could go on and on.\r It's basically a seasonal item collection sim","I spent close to $400 to be able to play this game and I feel as though I and all other Animal Crossing fans have been scammed . After years of waiting , Animal Crossing fans were excited to hear there was a new mainline Animal Crossing game coming which promised amazing new features for decorating and truly customizing the  exterior of your town . It was a bit suspicious that they only showed the beginning of the game in the promotional material and didn\u2019t showcase any of the rest of the things that are present in every other Animal Crossing game once you progress past the beginning . But , people figured there was a good explanation for this and , of course , expected that the game would include all the features that all the other mainline Animal Crossing games have because those things are what makes a mainline animal crossing game a mainline animal crossing game and differentiate them from the spin off games which are missing those features . However , once the game launched and people played it for a few weeks it became clear all those things were completely absent from New Horizons and that New Horizons only featured about 1/4 of the content of a normal Animal Crossing main title . When the game released , Nintendo promised to continuously update it for a few years and , in the beginning , they did do some fairly significant updates . This lead people to believe that the missing features in the game would come in the future but it is clear now , after a year of playing and seeing the updates get fewer and further between , that the game is never going to update to the point it can be considered the mainline Animal Crossing game that they claimed it was . The game itself is more like Animal Crossing Happy Island Designer than a mainline Animal Crossing Game . If you think of it as an Animal Crossing spin-off game for decorating an island then it is actually fairly fun , although , a bit unnecessarily tedious . If they had advertised it truthfully like that fans would have been happy with the game . But , the deceit of calling it a main line game , knowing it would mislead their customers into spending money , and then stringing them along for a year before revealing their trickery so there is no hope of fans getting their money back is , frankly , unforgivable . I would not have paid $60 for this game let alone the $400 I had to pay to buy the game , a Switch , and Nintendo Online to be able to play it properly . And that\u2019s another thing , on top of having much fewer items than previous games ( despite essentially being a decorating simulator ) , you are required to pay for Nintendo online and trade with other players to be able to get half of the items . They want you to trade with your friends but no one has enough friends who want to spend hundreds of hours trading on animal crossing to be able to get every item they want ( especially since there is nothing to do for entertainment when you connect online with friends like there was in past games ) which forces them to go online and meet up with sketchy strangers who often try to scam them because there is no mechanic in game to be able to trade online safely . It\u2019s clear this was just another tactic to get people to spend more money on the game without regard to making an enjoyable gaming experience . That seems to be the overarching theme of this game . They wanted to scam millions of fans into buying New Horizons with false promises of a mainline Animal Crossing game when the reality was an unfinished cash-grab , scam people into buying a Nintendo Online subscription to be able to fully play said game , and scam people into buying a Switch so that they will buy more games for it from them in the future . Well , in the future , unless they decide to make it right and actually update the game to being a proper Animal Crossing mainline game , I will never buy a Nintendo game at release again and I will buy all my Switch games used so that I do not support this company .","After 500+ hours, I can confidently say that I know almost everything about the game and I have no more motivation to play it. Even without time travelling, it has become too easy to progress. You quickly run out of essential things to achieve. You can decorate outdoors now, which is great, but the variety in items is too limited. The game also very quickly starts dropping below 30 FPS if you decorate MODERATELY (not even talking about cluttering!) and if you're sensitive to that, it's horrible. Island building is an amazing new feature, but this seems to be at the cost of many other things. Way too little events, no more fun buildings like the coffee shop and not many special villagers as well. It's really missing that depth. You can now go on island trips to 'choose' your own villagers and they don't randomly leave anymore. That's great. Other than that, their personality and quirkiness in dialogue is ultimately gone. They pretty much say the same every two days. In the end, the game is a fun decorating simulator with lots of limits. It desperately needs a 2.0 upgrade with many new features and items.\rAnother big minus: Every island has a fixed color palette on all items that come in different colors. Instead of collecting color-changing items, you are now forced to buy Nintendo Switch online and trade. This is a big turnoff for me. Say, if you want a basic item like a white streetlamp, but your island only offers rusty red ones, you won't be able to get it unless you trade with someone else. I think this is a horrible feature and takes away the freedom of decorating. This applies to around 60-70% of all available items.","New Horizons killed my love for this franchise. Animal Crossing is supposed to be a cozy life sim but NH really is nothing more than just a soulless decorating game.... save yourself the trouble and get New Leaf instead.","Disappointing compared to predecessors. Lack of content in advertised \"free updates\". Would not have bought if I knew the updates would be so lackluster.","I can't believe it... After digging nearly 400 hours into New Leaf on the 3DS, I was patiently awaiting the next iteration on Nintendo's newest console. I was just as excited as everybody else was when the game was first teased and then announced; getting hyped to yet again to be fully immersed in the island life.\r It's too bad that this game was such a magnificient disappointment!\r I started to play this as soon as I got it as an Easter gift, I started putting in many hours and... something wasn't clicking. Unlike New Leaf, where I would have sleepless nights waiting to enter my village for the next day, this game gave me no such feeling. I also played New Leaf consistently for about three years, yet this game became boring to me after about a month. So what gives?\r Firstly, there are a few positive things to praise the game for (although mostly minor in the grand scheme of things). The graphics are gorgeous in the game, and the miniscule details added along with them like Villagers now doing activities is so fun to see! The Soundtrack, while it is inferior in comparison to the wonderful soundtrack of previous Animal Crossing games (Especially New Leaf), is still very nice to hear and I enjoy the songs.\r With that out of the way, let's get into the many negative aspects. For starters, there's nothing to do! In New Leaf you could shop on Main Street, do errands and play minigames with villagers, visit the island with friends, go thrifting, enjoy tourneys and other special events, and plenty more! New Horizons is just... bare bones (which is quite applicable for the state of the game as a whole.). Special Characters and many shops have been gutted from the game. As you can see in some other reviews here, the developers also promised frequent updates to the game which would add in more content and even gave me and others the hope that many characters and shops would return... Nope! A year in and the updates have been incredibly lackluster, adding in nothing of note ( Well except for content that was ALREADY IN PREVIOUS GAMES). Holidays and Tourneys are God Awful in New Horizons. For example, in a New Leaf Fishing/Bug Tourney you would be competing with all the villagers in your town on catching the largest bug/fish. Whoever caught the largest by the end of the day would be placed in the top 3 and receive a trophy and maybe even special furniture for their achievements. In New Horizons the tourneys are... You against yourself? They instead opted for simply catching the most bugs/fish in an allotted time limit to get a prize. That takes away the fun and soul of a tourney. You would also think the events would be better but that is also a lie, some events are months long where all you do is the same stuff (cough cough wedding day). Speaking of soul being ripped out, let's talk about the villagers. It used to be fun and charming talking with your villagers everyday in New Leaf. You would slowly build up friendships by visiting each other's houses, completing errands, playing games, etc... In New Horizons this has all been sacrificed and Villagers have been made cute objects to look at instead of actual living villagers... The big gimmick of this game is the customization of your island with terraforming, decorating, and crafting being buffed or newly added features. Crafting becomes monotonous and grindy when you have to grind resources from your island day after day, making none of this new system fun for me at all. Animal Crossing should be a game where I can escape the stresses of life and relax, not have to grind for some stupid iron ore in a rock! Oh and by the way Nintendo, drip feeding through updates is not how you make previous Animal Crossing players want to come back to your game!\r It pains me to say it but I really cannot recommend this game. Another reviewer here mentioned how this game is more like a \"Happy Home Deluxe\" where the game is great with decorating and customization, but forgot everything else that makes Animal Crossing Animal Crossing. If you want a true Animal Crossing experience, pick up a 3DS and play New Leaf, by far the better game. I entered this game thinking this could be one of Nintendo's greatest series, now I'm left shivering at the future of Animal Crossing Games.","It's a good game with wasted potential, it was worthy of being the best animal crossing game, it had a lot of potential, like editing the Minecraft-style terrain, also in crafting things, like the minecraft crafting table, but just Nintendo and its developers, they did not know how to implement it well, the manufacturing is very bad, in capital letters! It is very tedious to find the iron, stone and clay, the terrain, it becomes very repetitive, after a few days pass, the developers did not know how to implement it well.\r Music is just MEH\r AC ACCF and ACNL, has great music, which made identifying the games in an excellent way, especially new leaf, it has the best music of the entire saga, examples are, 1am, 8am, 1pm and 5pm, you can feel it identified.\r In New Horizons?\r His music can be meh, bad, mediocre, I say that his music is very repetitive and bad, it does not fit the environment, which in this case is an island, for me, almost all of them are bad , with the exceptions of 12pm, 8pm, 3pm and 5pm, which do give a tropical atmosphere.\r Its graphics are good, to be a 2020 game on switch, although in the animal neighbors, many do not convince me, they look a little plastic, cheer them up, but that is forgiven.\r The mechanics are terrible!\r In later installments, Nintendo was forgiven, that you could only generate a world, for 4 players, but in new horizons, that is no longer forgiven.\r It's just ridiculous, like that one island? If the switch, being a more powerful console than the wii u, can support several maps, that is, do I have to pay another $ 400 for a switch and the game? it is no longer tolerable.\r The animal neighbors, they became someone without personality or soul, in new leaf or later installments, your neighbors wanted to meet you, you could see their personality in them, they were like people or friends of yours, that you could do many things, such as invite them to your home .exchange things, play among others.\r In new horizons, they just became puppets without personality, you can no longer do that, which later installments offered you, they are careless and you cannot talk to them so much, I limit myself a bit to that.\r updates.\r The updates, from 1.0.0 to 1.9.0, could be in the base game, it is an excuse, so that Nintendo can extend the life of the game, in my opinion, the updates themselves are bad, almost not brings nothing new, just a couple of sets and the events, which could be in the base game, as I repeat.\r In conclusion, this game is not for that fan of ancient animal crossing, if you are looking for a delivery, that you simulate a life with animals and feel identified, because this game is not for you, play new leaf, city folk and that of game Cube.\r but if you want to hang out, this game is for you.\r 1/10","The good:1. Improved visuals and atmosphere2. QoL improvements3. Prologue phase is a really good introduction to the seriesThe bad:1. Base game is very shallow2. Life-sim aspects are butchered3. Villagers feel like decorations4. Series staples beloved by the fanbase missing5. Updates are spaced out, leaving players frustrated with long content droughts6. Updates are also lacking in substantial content that will give players a reason to continue playingAfter more than a year, the game is still pretty much the same experience at launch. Very weak entry in the series, which is entirely focused on decorating and designing the island, leaving the core life-sim aspects of the series abandoned for seemingly no reason.","This game stinks! I want a refund right now! This game is unfinished and lacking. I haven't even played this game since April 2020. This game is such a disappointment.","The game is horrible. Plain horrible. First of all, it included no manual! How am I supposed to figure out what to do without a manual? Overall, music is boring and repetitive. Only one song! Dialogue can be repetitive. Only two villagers! Uncalled for Crafting and DIY and Phone! I gave it a try, it had a 90 Metascore, and most of the user reviews complained by more than one island, which is stupid, but I didn\u2019t care. Wrong! IT WAS RIGGED! The day after I ranted the max out of this game, I saw a review with a critic score of 5/10! The lowest here was a 7/10! Metacritic is rigged, and I do not trust them! DO NOT TRUST THEM! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I haven\u2019t played previous AC games, I may give New Leaf or the GameCube one a try sometime in the future. They look, at least visually and gameplay-wise, a lot better. They seemed to have more content. After looking at recent reviews, I decided to do the same and refund my game. I suggest you do too! I don\u2019t know about previous games, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. A lot of people are suggesting it, so what the heck. Why not. They are considered superior versions, so be it. I\u2019ll give them a wild shot. But for this game? 0/10. I can\u2019t give it any higher. I suggest you do the same.","Just because it\u2019s new, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good. I believe I have said enough.","New Horizons is disappointing, and lacks the content we were promised to get. It deserves nothing more than a 0/10.","The most abysmal game of the Nintendo Switch, if not, all of Nintendo's game consoles... ever. Abysmal is just one of the thousand words I have to say of this game. It is subpar, it sucks, it is unbelievable. I believe it's the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. This may sound extremely harsh, but to me, it is just 1% of what I feel about this game. This game is remotely awful. Plastic graphics that look more flat than a line, repetitive guitar music that sounds like it came from a cheap royalty-free music selection, repeating villager dialogue that just feels like they are on loop, and it never ends. I can't believe how atrocious this horrible game is. I cannot even express my anger to this insane game. If I were to continue, I'd start a whole rant here, so I'm just going to stop here. 0/100. Not even a single decimal I can give it. It is dreadful, and I cannot take the anger any longer. In my book, this game is unspeakable. Horrendous. Again, I'm just going to stop here. I cannot talk about this game any further.","Too boring. Too repetitive. Lacking in content. Updates aren't helping at all.","I've had enough of New Horizons. A tiring boring game that so happens to be the result of milking a series. It's a lie. In fact, if anything, this game is a borefest. A very boring game... I hate it so much... but this is only the beginning... I would go on, but I have better things to do than rant on a trash game like this one.","This is the worst game in the series. First off after the start there is just nothing to do. Talking to villagers and becoming friends which is the whole point of animal crossing is horrible in the old games i felt like i made friends now if feels like i have a bunch of stuffed animal that say the same ten sentences when you press the leg. it could be a great game but it doesn't feel like animal crossing anymore.","Yes the decision to allow only one island per switch is silly, but that does not mean the game is an automatic 0. Animal Crossing was always like this anyway. The game starts a bit slow, but there is still plenty to do thanks to the new feature of nook miles.The game has plenty of content and features new to the series, but but none feel out of place in the world of Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing New Horizons is something that both longtime fans and newcomers to the series can enjoy.","This game is absolutely incredible! As a long-time fan of animal crossing, I have played every game since the GameCube. It is incredible to see how far the series has come! The graphics themselves have truly made the game franchise and villagers come to life! No detail left unnoticed, from the way the rain drops on the water to the way the wind sways in the trees. This game is truly a beautiful escape during such an unfortunate time in history. Even my husband who hasn\u2019t been interested in previous games is hooked to this one. The crafting is addictive, and \u201cNook miles\u201d objectives keep you playing for hours on end. This game is truly a masterpiece and I can tell there was a LOT of time spent on this game by the developers! Even the dialogue is simply fantastic. I haven\u2019t seen such awesome dialog since the GameCube says. To all of those upset about the \u201cone island per switch\u201d, that is how every game has been except for the GameCube (one town per memory card). I don\u2019t think it warrants a negative review whatsoever because it\u2019s not a feature that has been taken away recently from the series. If that\u2019s the case, where are the negative reviews for new leaf, city folk, and wild world?? My only small beef with the game (and why it\u2019s 9/10) is that it is missing a large handful characters from previous games. Reese, Cyrus, Cappin\u2019, Rover, Pelly, Porter, etc. are no where to be seen. If you are a long time fan of the series, you will definitely feel their lack of presence. There are new characters enrolled to fill the spots of some characters yet to make an appearance. However, hopefully with future updates they will return for an event or possibly dlc!","Cheesy childish garbage. Why does this even exist!? Who on their right mind would pay money for this?","At first I loved this game because it was addicting and relaxing but overtime the game became tedious and boring. Pros: -addictive -easy-relaxing -slow-paced Cons-tedious -tons of inconveniences that shouldn\u2019t be in the game \u2014if you share a switch with someone you have to share an island with them","I recently got the game as a gift and I'm actually LOVING it, incredibly fun and addictive. I only have a switch lite so I am not impacted by the 1 Switch, 1 Island problem.\r Regardless, I cannot give a good review to a game which is so clearly anti-consumer. Nintendo used to be one of the last few holdouts standing against the despicable practices ruining the gaming industry, but now it seems they are jumping onto the bandwagon in a thinly veiled attempt to sell more switches (why they need to do this when its selling like crazy is beyond me). Hopefully, they will remove this ridiculous rule in an update and i can delete the second half of this review.","This game is enjoyable but is unbelievably frustrating when you can't even get 30 iron ingots to build a shop or you have to work your tail off for weeks and weeks and it's so frustrating to play some days  And it's like how do I progress when I feel so Stark and so  Abandoned.","My mom was really excited to play this so she had my switch for two weeks. Now I'm I stuck on her island. Glad I paid 60$ to be a visitor.","When I first bought this game I really enjoyed it. I didn't mind the slow pacing at release and it was a fun way to kill time. The longer the game has gone on though the more I have realized how much this game is dependent on RNG. Eventually everyone will come to realize that this game is actually a grind casino dressed up as a fun way to kill time.","Boring boring game everyone got way too hyped over. I\u2019m sure it has its niche audience that likes this style of gameplay but it\u2019s massive level of success is circumstantial (covid). Playing it and talking with people about it feels a little like it felt when Pok\u00e9mon go launched. Everyone loved it, i was momentarily charmed, but it got old fast. I bet the few friends of mine still playing won\u2019t be in a couple months. But we will still be playing smash. Lol.","My sibling and I bought the Animal Crossing Special Edition switch consoles just to play Animal Crossing. We knew we had to share an Island, so I was the second player and played for a few hours until I realized that the first player gets to do everything and experience events, while the second player has no decisions on the island and is inferior. As I don't see any point in playing with an inferior character, I just deleted my character and let my sibling play the game on their own. If they allowed the second player to have the same responsibilities as the first player or allowed 1 island per game cartridge, I would have bought another game cartridge to play (which would also be a profile for Nintendo), but no, Nintendo wants us to buy separate consoles. Nintendo is very money hungry. I have the money and can buy my own switch, but I refuse to support such greedy actions as there are other families that can't afford to buy a switch for each child. I guess I will go back to my PS4.","I can\u00b4t believe the one campaign per console limitation. This is the biggest disappointment I had in any 60 dollars game ever. I did not know about it when I bought it, why would it be like that? Never saw that before. Anyway, the game can have a really nice gameplay, but it wont be a game until this is fixed, which I think wont. Total scam, Nintendo.","When using multiple accounts only the primary account has access to certain game functions. This slows the progress for every other account since the game only allows one island per device.","Anima crossing new horizons is a good game but it has a big problem. The fact that you can only have a island per switch is pretty bad for the ones that can't buy another nitendo switch and have siblings that are interested in play the game alone, that includes me and my brother. I really hope that nitendo fix this issue because it's the only problem that i see with this game.","I'm generously giving this a 5/10, because the gameplay is full of flaws and ages terribly.\r This title's multiplayer \"feature\" is complete and utter garbage. First off, every single time a new player joins, a lengthy cut-scene (about 40 seconds) will display to EVERYONE on the island. Also, no one is allowed to use Nookphones or have a dialog while a new player tries to connect. Then, comes the biggest issue: the game DOES NOT SAVE while another person is visiting your island. Imagine you've been playing with your friends for one hour or so, and suddenly your connection fails (even a second is enough). Every player will be disconnected and ALL the progress made by EVERYONE in the last hour will be COMPLETELY ERASED Even the host will lose all the progress. The game only saves at two moments, when in multiplayer: when a player leaves or when someone arrives on your island.\r Then, there are the crafting mechanics. Poorly thought and limited, you cannot craft more than a single item at once. If someone needs 15 fish bait, the player will need to craft fish bait 15 times, go through the lengthy dialogues 15 times and endure the cut-scene 15 times. This issue is somewhat fixable by having a Turbo controller.\r What can't be fixed is the lack of recipes. I've only got one recipe a day by opening the bottles that come ashore, and a random villager will also gift you a random recipe once a day. I have got duplicates on many occasions. And that's about it for obtaining new recipes. You'll need a thousand years to complete the recipe list.\r This game has a ton of new fishes and different species. But to get them all for your museum, you'll need to travel using Nook Miles Tickets. While those aren't particularly expensive, there's only about 1% of chance of visiting an island with different fish or bugs. I'm 70 hour into the game and NEVER managed to travel to an interesting island. Most of the times, players'll get sent into a small island that has the exact same resources as the home island. So, if you think exploration is a forte in this game, rethink.\r Then comes the arbitrary limitations: players are not allowed to send more than two letters a day, cannot purchase or view custom designs when someone is visiting, cannot terraform when online, trading or giving fish or bugs in any way is not possible. Redd will only sell a single piece of art a week (original or false). Terraforming is full of limitations, such as not building waterfalls in a diagonal or leveling the edges of an island.\r Building mechanics are mediocre. The house interior is very customizable, and player designs are very well used in the game. But the lack of crafting recipes and the Nook store's 4 itens a day limitation will cripple your creativity. There are nearly no counters or tables to furniture the house.\r Getting attached to villagers is also not recommended, as they'll randomly move away, even if you talk to them everyday and create friendship bonds, the'll eventually leave you. I like to think that each villager is a tickling bomb, when their internal timers reach zero, they'll vanish from my island and a new random'll take up their space . There's also no getting around to this.\r So, the good things: the graphics are really cute, well made and unique. The music is also very good, the new mechanics (although sloppy and poorly thought) are a welcome addition to the series. There has been some good quality of life improvements, such as inventory space and item catalogues. But all in all, the problems of this game overcome the improvements. And they have added interesting new content via updates, although nothing was game-changing.\r I can only recommend this to VERY enthusiast newcomers into the series that have never played sandbox videogames before, or to die-hard Animal Crossing fans that are willing to swallow its many problems while paying 60 dollars for a clearly unfinished game that lacks a lot of polishing. Even though, a warning for those people: like Pok\u00e9mon, this game has NO CLOUD SAVING. If something happens to your console or the save data gets corrupted somehow, your island is done for. Users cannot manually backup the save, because it's stored inside the console (not on the gaming card, not on the SD Card memory).\r I have played this for about 70 hours, but the frustration with the lack of polish and overall unfinished or pre-test project feeling this game has is too much for me to keep on playing. I now seriously consider selling the cartridge to get something else. This game is nowhere as polished as Breath of the Wild, and its quality is substandard for a console-seller title. A lot of people will hop into ACNH because of the hype and, like me, will be frustrated when they realize this game ages like milk.","There is no point play as secondary player in Animal.Crossing : New Horizon.The secondary player is not able to help in progressing the island project and mission.It is very disappointing for a $60 game that only allow 1 player to have the full gaming experience","Excellent job nintendo.I cant stop playing. I cant go outside.I am enjoying the game more than real life lol.","I don't have someone else to play with me so I doesn't care for that problem... it's a great game I just miss the soundtracks of New Leaf.I think it's a great idea to only have 1 Island, but an update that all new Players have the same opportunities as the first Player would be niceand you can play the game together as Family if your playing Co-Op... so if you can't play Co-Op TOGETHER then it's not even \"playing together as family\" then go buy your own Switch please...the same problem was at the 3DS Version but nobody was crying why is everybody crying now?","I haven\u2019t played animal crossing since the game cube and all I remember was shaking trees, getting stung by bees and making my 10 year old dream house. The formula has changed surprisingly little but I have put in over 30 hours in just a week so you could say I\u2019m addicted. I love the crafting and fishing. When I boot up the game I never have a plan but end up playing for hours. It sucks that you can\u2019t have more than one island per console but my wife is fine to play a little here and there while I take main control so it doesn\u2019t affect us as much but I do feel sorry for those players who want to have two islands on one console. I\u2019ve really liked this game and would recommend it to anyone with a switch. For me, breath of the wild and Mario Odyssey are a perfect 10, smash is a 9, then I\u2019d put Mario kart, Mario maker and Animal Crossing new horizon as an 8. Just as a point of reference, ya know?","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best video game in the series in terms of content and features. Something that I love in this game as always in the franchise, is the closeness it has with reality, now more than ever. Time, season (now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island) and weather equal to your city's. It also highlights how alive the game is, with dialogues from the neighbors that change continuously (not counting those of the main characters, which are very repetitive) and situations between them, that can make you feel as if you were really inside. Many people are annoyed that there is only one island per console, but not me personally, and that is one of the many characteristics that make the Animal Crossing saga unique. The union and trust between the players who live together in the same space. Despite this, I have to admit that multiplayer on the same console is somewhat messy, since it does not allow the second player to join the game directly and it has to go through a somewhat slow process. In addition to the fact that in order for him to do any minimum action, the first player must change his position as leader, and although it is a simple and fast process, it tires having to do it many times. Still, the control of the character and interface in singleplayer mode is not bad, because I really liked the idea of using a phone as a menu to navigate between the different options. Online mode is better than I expected and is an example of how multiplayer should be on the same console, although the transition between when the visitor arrives on the island and when he leaves can be repetitive when you connect many times with friends, but it is still pretty (somewhat long). As a conclusion, I can affirm that each new day on the island feels fresh and eager to start, although progress can feel slow but satisfactory. The new playable crafting and construction features can appeal to both veteran and new players alike, and graphically as well as musically it is very, very good. I am enjoying and having fun with this game and I hope to finish it completely because I liked it a lot, and it is not that it has exceeded my expectations because it was just what I expected but I do not regret buying it at all, it is highly recommended and I assure that those who play it will like it a lot.","Not a perfect game, but definitely a great one.\r Cons:\r1. Online multiplayer waiting screen\rYou have to wait for 30~60 seconds every time someone visits or leaves your island. The waiting screen is kinda cute, but when you're playing with, let's say, 5 other people, you have to see that screen 10 times per session.\r 2. No bulk crafting/wonky inventory management\rAnimal crossing didn't have that many kinds of stackable items before New Horizons, and DS, 3DS, Wii version all had either touch screen or Wii remote which made pulling out items from the stack really fast and convenient, even if you can only remove 1 from the stack at a time. However, in NH you have to slowly remove an item from the stack each time, and the fact you can have 30 woods per stack (and even more for some items) doesn't help here. Also, the problem of slow, repetitive tasks is also in crafting, especially when you're crafting fish baits with manila clams.\r 3. No cloud save (yet)\rI won't elaborate.\r 4. Game's progression is tied to the first player.\rCan cause a huge pain if the first player stops playing this game. You should, at the very least, be able to change who's the boss among the players.\r From here, I'll talk about the problem everyone is ranting about, but personally I didn't have a big  problem with it.\r5. Local multiplayer\rThe problem I have with the local multiplayer, is the fact second player don't have access to the tool wheel, and they somehow can't even hold an umbrella. You will have like 6 tools in your inventory and it takes ages to cycle through them. Also, the second player goes \"HEY I FOUND THIS\" like Link every time they collects an item, which takes too long if you're picking up several items, like when you're chopping or shaking a tree. Other than that, it's quite fun running around chopping trees and catching fish, wandering around with my sister.\r 6. One island per console\rI understand everyone's frustration about this, but personally, I would like to share island with my family and renovate the island to a beautiful place, where our whole family worked together and have lovely memories about them. The lack of the choice isn't that good, so I'll put this as cons anyway.\r Now, I won't write about Pros here, but it's overall much better than the last game I've played, which is the Wii version of animal crossing.\r PSA: This game is NOT all about progression. The progression lies within how the island changes as you put efforts in it, building museum and upgrading resident service is only a part of it.","This game was definitely worth the wait! Starting New Horizons brought me back to the very first time I played Population Growing - learning and exploring the game in its unique way. The level of attention to detail and atmosphere that was put into it makes each play session a relaxing and enjoyable experience. As a veteran of the series, I can appreciate its reworking of past installments' features such as the message-in-a-bottle from Wild World and the crafting introduced in Pocket Camp. My sister and I are roommates and share a Switch, and yes, it's disappointing that we can't have separate islands on one console. However, the co-op mechanic has potential. It's not a perfect game, but it comes pretty close.","This is an amazing and relaxing game and it's a shame that people are rating it so low because you can only have one island per console and knowing Nintendo they will probably fix it in the next update like they fixed the multiplayer in Mario maker","I really love this game, but it is impossible to play online with friends.  To get to the island of another player is only 1 case out of 100.  And a constant error is not only me - my friends also can not get to the islands of each other.  We all tried to set up our routers and read tips from nintendo (which are completely useless).  The online game doesn't really work.","Critics really missed the mark when they let Nintendo slide with the \"one island per console\" junk.  This is a terrible precedent to set and it is not good for anyone for this game to be so popular with such anti-consumer functionality.","This is the most difficult game to score. I want to give it at 9 or a 10. But what Nintendo has done here is inexcusable, unnecessary, and unexplainable. If your Switch is yours and yours alone, then you won\u2019t have the same issues I\u2019ve been having. It really boils down to the one island per Switch decision they\u2019ve implemented. Our island rep has lost interest in playing, so that leaves me with many hundreds of thousands of bells and Nook Miles with nothing to do but try to generate more and more to no end.\rI loved the time I spent with this game. Now realizing that after all this time I spent, everything I\u2019ve earned and unlocked along the way was truly for nothing. And it makes me angry. At this point it would be unfathomable to delete everyone\u2019s save data and start over. I\u2019ve come so far and done so much. I\u2019ve got some rare items, crossbred many colours of flowers, unlocked just about every item currently available in Nooks Shop...and now here I am. Faced with a decision I shouldn\u2019t have to make.  Do I delete all this work and start over...or do I just quit?\rNintendo has shown great disrespect to its customers with their one island decision. It may be the shadiest thing I\u2019ve ever fallen for in terms of video games. I can\u2019t believe they ruined it with this decision. I haven\u2019t enjoyed a game this much in YEARS but...yeah they had to find a way to absolutely kill it for some reason.\rVery disturbing decision by Nintendo and hopefully not a sign of things to come. It\u2019s sad. It really is. Was it greed that prompted this decision? Idk, do they actually think people the world over would buy a second Switch so they could have their own island? That\u2019s just not in cards for many people. Could I? Yeah probably, but that wouldn\u2019t be very financially responsible for someone who has an actual life to live and maintain. What they\u2019ve done here is within their rights, but I don\u2019t understand it, and there\u2019s no way around it. They got my money I guess and that\u2019s good enough for them. How could you Nintendo?","I'm so sad about that player 2 limitation. Like many I bought this game to play with my girlfriend not knowing we will have to share an island.The idea of shared island seemed pretty funny at first but it appears to be a prison cell for player 2.It feels like you follow the path of the true hero of the game and its pretty disappointing. At the beginning of the game you don't even got a proper introduction and for the rest you have to wait for player 1 to progress to do anything intersting.This is our first Switch game and I must say I'm so disappointed I don't fell like playing it anymore.","Here is a breakdown for you:\r - Previous features and characters have been removed.\r- Islands feel small and crammed.\r- Content is limited and drip-fed.\r- Crafting and customizing are tedious chores.\r- Tools break way too easily, and having to craft twice to build one tool is a pain in the a***.\r- Travelling becomes pointless after a couple of trips.\r- Terraforming gets old quick.\r- UI is irritating and everything takes too many button presses. Menu and dialog mechanics from the 1990s are not fun in 2020, Nintendo.\r- Background music is repetitive.\r- Interacting with villagers is repetitive.\r- Local multiplayer is practically a scam.\r- Online multiplayer is basically a middle finger to people with no friends that play the game. Matchmaking? Why bother developing such a feature when you can send people to Facebook to watch some ads.\r Sure, graphics look great and the first few hours of gameplay are entertaining but if you scratch past the surface it is not a very good game.","Why is it still an island on one device? The second player has nothing to do.","Vraiment g\u00e9nial, c'est New Leaf en mieux ! H\u00e2te de voir le jeu avec toutes les mises \u00e0 jours saisonni\u00e8res et tous les b\u00e2timents dispo :) J'aurais mis 9/10 vu que tout n'est pas encore d\u00e9blocable comme la section art du mus\u00e9e, mais vu la stupidit\u00e9 des gens qui notent n\u00e9gativement le jeu parce qu'ils ne se sont pas renseign\u00e9s avant d'acheter je rel\u00e8ve alors ma note \u00e0 10/10 ! Buy DOOM Eternal if you are frustrated.","Boring. Grind for grind. Parasitic mechanics like it's a free to play cheap mobile game. And, for sure, the greediest idea in a history -- one player per console.Doesn't worth buying. Professional \"critics\" should be stopped reading and considering, they have proven it many times","At its most basic, it succeeds as an AC game. If you\u2019re looking for something new in the AC franchise this will entertain you without issue if you play sporadically. Spend a good amount of time with it and you will see how careless and thoughtless some of the design decisions are. Crafting seems to have been added as an afterthought because it polled well with focus groups. Building your own tools fits the theme of beginning life again on a new island, but after it loses its novelty, its just a VERY basic durability system that doesn\u2019t show any gradual degradation. Your perfect-looking net or axe just vanishes with a poof after enough uses. It tries to encourage a loop of gathering and crafting, but crafting more than one or two things at a time is so tedious I\u2019d often find myself pulling up a different screen to look at. I\u2019m not saying the system doesn\u2019t belong in the game, but the combination of \u2018only random\u2019 (still multiple duplicates or recipes from the recipe kits available at the very start of the game) recipe acquisition, clunky crafting UI, and literally no form of progression makes me wonder how much more robust this kind of system could be in 2020.The biggest killer for me was the villager system. If someone moves out you get a vacant lot in their place. It will randomly fill after some random number of days. This feels like someone else making villager choices for you while you accidentally left your switch unattended. I think this is so you will feel pressured into buying Amiibos to help replace villagers you did not invite to your island. Having them move out on their own can take WEEKS (This system is what made me want to leave this review).Many of the systems in place to add a sense of a dynamic town begin to feel punishing. Random vendors/NPC visit the island but are limited to one visit per week. Take a day off from playing when the ones making collectibles of the things you caught happen to be visiting? Better luck next week! There are a lot of QoL issues that become infuriating after you spend enough time with the game. So many buttons go unused in menus and elsewhere. Buying items requires you to get them one or five at a time, clicking through multiple screens of unskippable text each time for the privilege. It just seems like they ran out of time making all the items and focusing on visual appeal (It\u2019s great!) and had to sacrifice having a deep look at the big flaws in this iteration. This game will be worth buying when it\u2019s been out for a few major overhauls. They\u2019ll focus on seasonal events and patching out exploits in between DLC releases. My prediction is they will never make any attempt at addressing the \u2018minor\u2019 issues outlined here because they don\u2019t break the game, they just make it more frustrating to play.","Just picked the game up for me and my wife to play and should have done more research. One island really??? So very disappointed in this and has left a bad taste making us not to really want to continue playing. The game seems fun so far but what's the point if we both can't have our own individual experience while playing together.","1  island per switch, if u are the second player this game sucks just because you dont have the same game","A game that perfectly encompasses everything wrong with Nintendo nowadays: new gimmicks that are barely capitalised on, less content than the previous titles, awful online gameplay, and no lack or charm. It's not just bad as an Animal Crossing game, it's bad as a game full stop. Never have I gotten bored of an Animal Crossing game within such a short amount of time, but once again Nintendo fails to innovate and gets away with it because it's Nintendo and they can do no wrong. This game is not good. Do not waste 60$ on what is an early access at best.","I really don't like this game, it takes too much time to play(farming).\rOnly the first few hours were fun. :(","I truly wish I could say I enjoyed this game. I played it as the first person on the console so I was able to get the full experience. I sunk 50 hours into it, but I\u2019m sad to say I disliked almost all of that time.It\u2019s an easy game to get lost in, I\u2019ll give it that, but after the first few tasks of the game when you are finally given free roam, it\u2019s boring. Absolutely nothing compared to the refreshing experience that was New Leaf.It may appeal to some, but personally, filling an island with objects that are unusable to achieve a 5 star rating is not what I expected from an Animal Crossing game. Dialogue with the characters on your island is short and lifeless. It\u2019s tedious to get actual tasks out of them. Terraforming seems fun to begin with, but soon becomes a chore when trying to create the \u2018perfect\u2019 island. Furniture cannot be interacted with, so once something is placed, that\u2019s the end of the fun. Filling the museum is enjoyable, but that\u2019s the most action the game has. You\u2019re basically turning your island into a museum anyway.Travelling to randomly generated islands feels repetitive, and the only redeeming quality of them is finding a rare bug or a cute villager.  I expected something amazing compared to New Leaf (which is my favourite Animal Crossing game), but New Horizons fell short.It\u2019s truly only worth the money if world-building appeals to you. It\u2019s a relaxing experience, but I expected more actual gameplay. I\u2019m disappointed to say the least. It\u2019s as lifeless as Amiibo Festival.","I cannot fully enjoy the game as I am a secondary account.  how is it possible that Nintendo allows this?","The dialog takes to long, and it's for 60\u20ac NOT the content that I expect. And wenn you want your favorite Villager yeah than buy some Animal Crossing Cards.","One island per console is terrible when sharing with a whole family. Each person that signs in *should* be able to shake furniture out of trees and dig up their fossils each day even if all on the same island, but it\u2019s not built like this. Does Nintendo update the game to allow this? No, no... they waste money and coding time on updating \u201cDream\u201d visits to islands where you can\u2019t actually do anything nor bring anything back. And you have to have a code to go to one to do nothing.Wow. Thanks Nintendo. That\u2019s... great?","Only one Island makes this game extremely awful for playing with several kids. Avoid it completely in case there are more than one person to play. My youngest daughter started with an island and the older is suffering since then. I have seriously thought to uninstall the game","It\u2019s so idiotic that you can only have one island per console. We can only afford one console for our family and many people would like to enjoy the game to the fullest.","Thank you for the drama and deception with my kids, nintendo. One island per console? What kind of stupid decision is that? This is ridiculous!","Bought this game for the promising coop experience for me and my GF. Turns out the first registered player in the game is only able go do progress on the \u2018\u2019main storyline\u2019\u2019. GF lost interest in the game as the main player, and I did not...  So im stuck playing 2 profiles. How about a detailed warning about this before starting making the profiles?????And the coop experice is a joke only 1 player can really do anything, other players are limited to using tools and thats it, gets boring so fast....I do not understand why is a good idea? Not even an option to make someone admin. No fun allowed. If you like solo play this game is for you, but find something els if you enjoy coop. The bad rating is due to the game being a huge letdown for me, would never spend this money if I knew those things.","My boyfriend was super excited for this game, and visiting each other's island. Today we got majorly disappointed...Only 1 island available per system. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER. Not only can't you make an island of your own, but all the decisions on the island are made by, essentially, player 1. If Nintendo fixes this sh*'t, I'll reconsider, but otherwise it's a 2 out of 10 for us.","An amazing experience \u2764. This is one of my favorite games, and you can spend a lot of hours in.","Why is there crafting in an Animal Crossing game? This isn't Minecraft! DO NOT RIP-OFF MINECRAFT NINTENDO! Stupid companies these days, greedier than EA. This game is worse than any game in history, and it should be a shame to Nintendo. I don't care about it's 90 Metacritic Score! That's fake! They only picked the good reviews and probably got paid by Nintendo to choose only the game one, and one mixed review. THAT IS NOT REALISTIC! Most games get several mixed reviews, and sometimes negative reviews. METACRITIC, DO YOUR RESEARCH! This game will forever be a 0/10.","This is without a doubt my favorite Switch game so far. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying and you really can mold your island into just about anything you want it to be. There are only two things I take issue with though-- crafting can be incredibly tedious and it needs a few changes (allow us to craft multiple items at once, skip the low-grade tools if we have the necessary materials for better ones). Secondly, I think allowing players to join you on mystery island expeditions would make the game even more enjoyable. They're fun to play on your own but exploring new islands and finding new materials would be even more exciting with friends.","Took the essential Animal Crossing core, and decorated and perfected it with modern mechanics which are additional but meaningful.","The game is absolutely stunning! The whole time I was sucked in, somehow I can always find things to do. It has so much freedom, and everything about it is great.\r (Well, maybe the multiplayer thing and \"one switch share one island\" thing was kinda going **** I heard, but I was the only one playing, so my review doesn't include that.)","Good, I enjoyed it. I haven't played the multiplayer so I can't comment on that.","Actually, the best Animal Crossing ever made.The only bad thing here is the bad multiplayer system.","Este juego es Hermoso!. la perfeccion en momentos tan dificil como el que estamos viviendo.\ramo a mis vecinos, y la mecanica de construccion.\rel apartado grafico es perfecto!, asi como el apartado tecnico...","An outright fun and amazing game. I feel in love with animal crossing a little late into the game but still found that this one respects the old ones and moves forward with new mechanics. I'm having a blast playing this game and would say that most people who enjoyed the older animal crossings would have a blast too.\r Only downside is that there are no gyroids. Hopefully they will add them in.","Really great relaxing game. You need to be patient if you want to get it, everything happens in real time so it's kind of slow but it's still a great game","One of my favourite games! At first i thought i wouldn't like it, but I've been addicted ever since launch!\r The only reason i haven't given it a ten is because of the fact that you can't have two islands on one switch. This is **** because 1: It's more than possible and 2: this is a casual game, so it attracts those who aren't avid gamer's. So if i'm playing this game and my younger sister wants to play it too, she has to buy ANOTHER switch if she wants her own island.\r Apart from that this games is perfect! there are various quality of life features that Nintendo could fix but they barely take away from the gaming experience. I will be playing this game for a long, long time!","This game is fun if you don\u2019t want to play with anyone else. If you have more than one person who wants to play it\u2019s a nightmare. If you choose to buy this game get a physical copy, if it drives you crazy there are no refunds from Nintendo eshop. I\u2019m so disappointed. I really liked it until I realized its really only meant for one person to have the full experience. Oh, and the multiplayer is horrendous. Only the \u2018leader\u2019 is able to do anything meaningful while the other players mostly just run around with them. The non leader cannot even pick up items.","Worst game ever! One Island per switch! Network doesn't work - loading every where, it's not playable!","Why WHY WHYYYY Nintendo!? These are some of the worse design choices for coop I've ever seen. Lets start with local coop issues, ONE shared island for every account on the Switch, No shared progress (Everything is done for player 1 only....recipes, island progression everything) PAINFULLY long collecting animation for local players collecting ANYTHING, NO INVENTORY for player 2 (every single item collected by player 2 goes to recycling bin), No ability to design anything for player 2. Just an absolute joke. Ok...lets say your a sucker like me and went out and bought your gf an ENTIRE 2nd NINTENDO SWITCH JUST TO ENJOY THE GAME. I can't say the online coop is any better. Wanna trade things into Blathers when you have a coop player? CAN'T Wanna visit another island with your friends? CAN'T DO IT! Outdoor customization with your guest? Nah can't do it. This isn't a review bombing. This is a legitimate cry for nintendo to get with the f***ing times. Its 2020 and the only way for me to invite my gf to a game is to setup a four digit code and give her the code. WHY CAN'T I JUST SEND HER A GAME INVITE LIKE EVERY OTHER CONSOLE NINTENDO!? Stop your stupid close minded game development and make something with full features considering your games are always locked at 60 bucks for years for garbage feature incomplete games like this REGULARLY. No one wants to talk about how the 4 \"dungeons\" in Breath of The Wild are basically the same \"manipulate this things position to solve problems\". This company is a shell of its formal self, where they leverage their brand recognition and colorful beutiful art design to shove garbage software down our throats desperate to play something as magical as the games we grew up on. DON'T support them anymore unless they get with the times.","I have played the game from the release date, and I'm addicted too this game! Is fantastic. I love the nature, crafting, visiting ppl and explore around. I can make your own style in clothes, furnitures and other things. And It's make me something to look forward to every day.","Hi, as a 14 year old with two siblings I have a few problems with this game. I have been so hyped for this beautiful game! So when I heard my mum had let us get the game for being good during her stay at the hospital, I was ecstatic! This game is \u00a349.99 and it is worth every penny. It is stunning. The best looking animal crossing game ever. Once downloaded, my brother let me watch him I was so excited seeing him play and I was dying to make my own island. However, I soon realised I couldn't do that. There is a limit of one island to a console. Now I understand the reason. It is a great business technique but it is just unfair. My mum was barely able to afford the one we have now and me and my siblings will not be able to share the one island. It'll cause too much frustration. Resource limitation and progression differentiation is irritating to say the least. Me and my sister won't have the same choices and things that my brother will get because he is the representative. I love animal crossing because it's a chill game. I can take my time and do what I want on my own file. But this makes it impossible to have as much fun as I'd have on New Leaf. I seriously just want to give up and let my brother have his fun and it breaks my heart. In this current time with this pandemic I just wanna go to a deserted island and forget what's is going on since I can't see my friends. But this limitation will tear me and my siblings apart which is not what we need.I don't want to drag this game because it doesn't deserve that. It has been amazingly developed and it has so many positives! I wish I could give it 10/10 but I can't. This one island per console is too unfair and too expensive. This game is advertised for families with kids and most kids will have siblings who will also want to play the game and that is not including the parents. Now, I don't know about you but my family can't afford 4 switches. I hope Nintendo fix this so I can give it the 10/10 it deserves!","I've never really been into games, but the last days I've spent most of my time enjoying animal crossing. My boyfriend wanted to introduce me to games and offered to buy this one on his switch. He set up the island, and i became 2nd resident. It was really disappointing when I realised that the reason I didn't make any progress was because my boyfriend was the island resident representative. Super greedy of Nintendo to expect people to buy not only another copy of the game, but also a new switch, to fully enjoy the game. All my joy for this game has been sucked out because of this experience.","I started a new account just to rate this. I bought this for my kids to play on thier switch but apparently having a separate profiles isnt enough.  They each have to have thier own switch Nintendo has gone the way of ripping people and I won't be buying anything else from them","This game is NOT a family game, because Nintendo CHOOSE to limit to 1 island by Switch !So, if you don't have 1 Switch and 1 game for each people in your house that want to play ACNH : YOU CAN'T !!! Because, ONLY the first player that run the game could make the island progression ! The other players are just there to help collecting resources, as if they were servants...The angry point is that Nintendo says u can play with 3 players in local multiplayer but it's FAKE ! It's not really a multiplayer game !You can't even have splitter screen, so you must stay near the LEADER player.I'm very disappointed, I couldn't afford, and I don't want to, buy 3 more Switch and 3 more games to play with my Wife and my daughters !","The game advertises multiplayer with a catch, the first player to play the game is the only player who can progress in the game. Every other player (your kids you bought the game for), are stuck. This is true even if you buy more copies of the game. This in itself doesn\u2019t merit the negative review. The worst offense is the company\u2019s response to thousands of fans. I\u2019m not going to buy games from a company who can fix a problem but tells everyone to eat it by refusing to address the matter at all.","I hate how you can only have 1 island per switch.  I got it for my birthday and player about 3 days,  when my little brother wanted to play it he could only play on my island andand could not build anything. You dissapointed a 9-year old child,  Nintendo.","Am I really supposed to spend 300\u20ac more to buy another Switch and another game to not mess my girlfriend island or simply have my own? The game that's supposed to calm me has me so pissed I made an account here just to give it a bad review.","I\u2019ve literally never been so disappointed in a while. The first and probably most obvious problem that a lot of other people are talking about is the 1st player priority and 1 town per switch. Put it simply, AC is a terrible shared console game (I can say that for literally most of the AC games). Not much of an issue for the last game because it was on the 3ds and people usually got their own 3ds (and even then, I\u2019d argue it was still a better shared console game). It\u2019s even worse in NH because it treats the 1st player special and all the other players are just useless (they can still destroy **** so gl sharing with someone younger). No backup save, no transfer, no alternative way of getting a different town other than giving Nintendo more of your money during a time like this where we\u2019d all rather save it. Of course there are more reasons to hate this game that has nothing to do with the multiplayer based reasons. Remember ordinances? Gone. Swimming? Gone. Coffee shop? Gone. Completely different areas with unique themes that were really useful? Kinda but not as good as before. Perfect fruits? Gone. Reliable tools? Gone. \u2018But tools breaking tools adds challenge!\u2019 Challenge as in being obnoxious? Remember this mechanic in BotW? It worked there because 1. I don\u2019t have to go through the same obnoxious crafting cutscene to make one again and 2. The breaking tools actually encouraged conservation and different strategies to fighting, meanwhile in this game, it\u2019s just a strain on your already limited resources that you get once per day (the survival/resource-scavenging thing doesn\u2019t fit AC at all). When you break your fishing rod, there\u2019s no alternative choice than to build another one. Also **** eggs.","Animal Crossing hasn't changed that much over time, but this title really rapresents the core of the franchise: chill, customize your island, have fun with friends. The graphics are stunning and the Nook Miles sistem works very well. I'm sure that thanks to the many updates and patches that Nintendo promised us, all the problems will be solved.","Why cant we batch craft? Why can't crafting pull from resources in storage? How come Mable can place clothing I bought into storage for me when /I/ don't even have that ability? Why can't we select multiple items to buy from the Tailor- instead having to purchase one at a time to leave and re-enter to buy the other colour options of a shirt I want? Why can't I select multiple items in my inventory and choose to send them all to storage? Why can I access Nook Phone while sitting but not my inventory? Why can't we sit on the ground next to villagers? Why aren't we allowed to meet villagers on mystery islands when we have full residence on Island? Why can't we choose to buy multiple of items through the terminal (It's a pain to buy a Nook Miles Ticket, wait for it to print out, choose to purchase more ONE AT A TIME.)\r Why can't we move buildings over by just a tile or two?( I've had to move a house/store somewhere else completely to then move it back to it's original location, just 2 spaces to the left). Why is there NOTHING to do with friends in this game? Where are the island minigames like in New Leaf?\r Why can't we ride the carnival rocking horsies like we've seen in footage leading up to the release? Why does Nook's Cranny take SO long to upgrade? (You would think a store upgrade would come before you even get the chance to have an entirely new Tailor shop take root in your island.) Why does the upgrade only include ONE extra furniture slot? Remember all the Nook store upgrades in New Leaf? wow.\r I WANT TO CRAFT MULTIPLE BAIT AT A TIME! I WANT TO PLACE RUGS ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE! I WANT TABLES AND COUNTERS TO PLACE MY ITEMS ON! I WANT GOLDEN TOOLS TO NOT BREAK- OR AT LEAST LAST WAY LONGER THAN THEY DO NOW. I WANT TO  HAVE ACCESS TO ALL FURNITURE COLOUR SWATCHES/BE ABLE TO MANUALLY CUSTOMIZE THE OTHERS IF I OWN ONE.\r The multiplayer in this game is so limiting. I want more furniture sets. This game could stand to be a hell of a lot more user friendly, bro.","First time i play animal crossing. I let my sister create the island. She played for a day or two. Now she doesn't want to play anymore. I have been playing for 10 days and i was wondering why i only got the museum.\rTruns out the second players can't progress the main story, or decide in any island related issue (new resident, new tools, bridge, new building etc).\ri am left with three options:\r- Delete main player and restart the island (35h juste for me)\r- Force her to play\r- Get on her character every day to upgrade main/house story, do resident management, etc\rSuch a wast of time.","I hate the fact that only 1 island per console as I believe most of the players would rather have the freedom to develop their island and have their own collections of stuffs by their own. If it is because of local co-op function, l would rather not have it, even though I have multiple family members sharing the console","Honestly made an account just so i can express my deep frustration of the ONE ISLAND per console debacle. Me and My wife were both extraordinarily excited build our own Islands, after she played for a couple days i decided it was time and was extremely let down when i realized i couldn't have my own Animal Crossing experience. Please for the Love of all that is gaming FIX THIS.","It's a real shame that nintendo locked 1 island per switch, this is unacceptable and really disappointing. They cant even think of the fact that tons of people out there like having their own worlds their own way. Horrible companies.","Games not bad. Unfortunately I have been robbed of a genuine individual experience because my gf started first. 1 island per switch is obnoxious.","My wife started playing before me. No option to create my own island which is fine but you can\u2019t progress in anything... Being the 2nd player to start on a console SUCKS!!!! You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.","The game doesn\u2019t let you progress if someone started the game before you. Either let us progress or give us a different island, having both makes this game really unplayable","One island per Switch is insane. You guys at Nintendo sure know how to come up with good ideas and totally ruin them. Won't touch this game again unless you can have more than one island per Switch.","Animal Crossing has of course improved itself with this new entry. New features like crafting, quick customisation, and being able to place furniture outside is amazing. And with QoL (Quality of Life) improvements, like the ability to expand your inventory and having resources automatically stack, I can\u2019t help but recommend anyone who has a Switch to buy this game.\r The only thing that stops me from giving a 10 is sadly the same-switch multiplayer, and the concept of it in its entirety. Having multiple villagers on one island, only one can experience the full game, but also stops others from getting further. This gives other players the feeling that they are missing 20% of the experience. From an other players\u2019 perspective, this isn\u2019t great, and the only thing that would make me happy is to just give each player an option to either join an existing island, or create a new one.\r (Also with couch co-op, please allow followers to use the favourites wheel)","I wish this game was more of a proper multiplayer game. I can't enjoy AC:NH with my sister because of how restrictive it is. Playing this as single-player is not what I bought the game for.","I was really looking forward to playing this game with my fiance, especially since we were in self isolation, but Nintendo has gone and ruined couch coop again. As the second player, I am pretty much useless. And that's playing solo as the second account. Playing together on the same screen is a complete joke. You literally serve no purpose. The coop is just the tip of the iceberg though. Nintendo is so authoritarian now that they want to control everything you do in their games. The time it takes to do anything in this game is comparable to a mobile game like clash of clans. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't gems you can buy to speed things up. I get it's supposed to be relaxing and slow, but if I want to play the game for 8 hours in a day (because I'm stuck at home from COVID-19) and progress, I should be able to. Instead I get at most 2 hours of play time and thats with visiting other islands using nook tickets.  Overall, the game is very disappointing. There aren't really any improvements over the older games, so I guess I'll just dust off my game cube because New Horizons just isn't very good.","Unfortunately as much as the game is gorgeous and pretty, for me as player two it is just unplayable and does not offer anything. Neither can I progress in the game nor can I create my own separate save file as I'm sharing the Switch with someone else. A hugely absurd design choice for the game that promised so much. Shared island could be manageable but limiting progress to player 1 is insane these days. Either me or the other person playing will be unsatisfied. Unfortunately all the fun is spoiled because of that and except of Player 1 there is simply no reason to play. Unfortunately I cannot get a refund due to my country's law but if I could I would definitely get it and I regret I actually bought the game and gave my money to Nintendo. And the best thing that it was never clearly said in official promoting materials about this limitation. Very bad move, will definitely think more than twice about buying any of their games in the future. I truly don't recommend this game if you're gonna play with someone else, don't make my mistake and don't buy it.","My wife and I just bought the game.  I loved Animal Crossing when I was a kid and was excited to show her how to play and compare our islands progress.  We started off with her account and she got everything set up and started.  When I went to create my island I was shocked that all the decisions had been made and I was off to the island my wife created.  I missed out on all decisions and interactions that make Animal Crossing your own.  I kind of feel robbed of getting to play the game like I did as a kid.  Nintendo should seriously consider releasing a patch that at least allows you the option to have separate save files for separate accounts.  To my knowledge all other games on the Switch treat each account as a independent save file.  Please Nintendo make this right!","Good game and I can't believe people are giving 0/10 reviews. Me, my brother and my sister all share the same island and we all are having a great time with the game, I stared the island so yes I do have more stuff to do but my siblings have not complained at all and have told me that there glad I decided to get it so basically don't listen to the 0/10s and this is a 100% must buy.","Really enjoyed playing the game until I found out about all the restrictions for 2nd players. It does not bother me that the representative gets to choose placement of things but we should all be able to contribute and progress the story/town and receive the special items the representative gets.","Made an account just to give this game a A glowing review. I\u2019m not a person that usually even plays video games but I went out and bought a switch just play animal Crossing and I couldn\u2019t be more happy with the gameplay I\u2019m excited to wake up every morning and see what\u2019s changed on the island","Giving a zero star review because I've never played this game. I own a Switch console with my roommates. I was thinking about buying New Horizons, but my roommate bought it first and started a file. I sat down to start my own file and then we realized the game's terrible multiplayer situation. She didn't exactly want me to play on her file, and I didn't want to have to intrude on her game. Furthermore, I want to have the whole experience of the game as someone who has never played an Animal Crossing game before. There is nothing I can do to have my own file except to buy an entire new console and game. Somehow, I don't think Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be worth a $360 price tag.\rIt's completely ridiculous that Breath of the Wild, a massive open world game that takes up 14G of storage and is one of the most popular releases for the system (as well as every other game) was able to find a way to allow for multiple save files for different users but Animal Crossing couldn't? We talked to Nintendo's support about the problem and they mentioned that the single file system was to maintain the game's \"artistic integrity.\" Well, Nintendo, thanks to all that integrity, I can't play this game. I hope they release an update to fix the save file issue because I really would like to experience this game.","Oh Nintendo. You really screwed this one up.\r One island per switch is a dreadful decision. What about a typical family with a couple of kids who can only afford one console and share? Absolutely wrecked this game for a lot of people, unless of course you're player 1, then I am sure you'll have a great time.","Got this game for my whole family in hope that everyone could have the same enjoyment i had with Animal Crossing when i was younger. I am required to share an island with my 8 year old sister who takes all of the resources and messes with my house on the daily. This game does not deserve better rating than this due to the lack of concern for players using the same switch. Limiting 1 island per switch might be the worst desighn idea that i have ever seen from Nintendo.","This would be a great game if not for the one island limit per console. I created my account second and I'm tired of being treated like a second class citizen. You have 0 power as player two and the island is way too small for multiple people. Nintendo needs to stop being greedy and fix this. Don't buy unless you have the entire console to yourself.","If you own this game and a Switch just for yourself you will probably like this game very much.  But if you share a console with someone (a family member or your girl/boyfriend) it will undoubtedly end with an arguments and anger. I can't even imagine having two children and one console. I will recommend this game only if Nintendo fix this no. of players limitation.","1 island per switch ruins the experience for both players due to having to fight for resources. Nintendo's solution? BUY ANOTHER SWITCH FOR A MEASLY 300 DOLLARS (if you can find one one in stock.) **** this game and **** nintendo's greedy asses","Only one island per switch. Not even per game. Worst decision ever. My girlfriend bought the game and is therefore player one but now I have to wait for her to progress the story. I can't even buy my own copy of the game to fix this it's infuriating.","A game that can only be played by one account. And its not about the horrible multiplayer, you can't even play it singleplayer as a second acount.","My boyfriend and I bought the game together and he was the first one to play, and now I\u2019m stuck as the 2nd player who don\u2019t get the same experience. It sucks because we both payed but now only one really gets the opportunity to play. Really disappointing","Wow, I wish I\u2019d read the reviews before buying this. Not having multiple islands on 1 Switch has left my daughter in tears and my son defensive about his island. I wouldn\u2019t have bought this knowing the problems it was going to cause especially as it was supposed to help during the lock down. Poor show Nintendo.","I loved this game until it literally made me have a fight with my boyfriend over the 2nd player being a glorified visitor.Nintendo should either make the resident representative title a transferable one or let one have multiple savefiles with the game, it truly destroyed any positive feelings I had towards this game.I would ask for a refund but I can't go to the store due to the coronavirus","This is truly bittersweet. I'm unable to even purchase this game because of the development decisions regarding one island per-console. We have a Nintendo Switch because it's a family console. I play as a parent, and several of my children also play. We have 4 joy-cons as well as *many* games. We will not be purchasing Animal Crossing because we do not wish to choose who gets to play it and who gets to \"not play\" it secondarily. If a future update resolves this issue, count us in.","To the buffoons who thought making this game damn-near inaccessable to a second account on the same console: congratulations you have utterly and completely screwed the pooch. My girlfriend and I spent our hard-earned money because we thought this would be a fun experience for both of us to share. Now imagine our disappointment at the realization that one of us would get a complete game while the other would get a slap in the face and a note that said: thank you for your money idiot! I will make it my life's priority to disparage this game in front of anyone who dares mention it. I will spit fire and hellstone at the person who dares glorify this fart parade of a game for I can accept a video game company trying to make money off my stupidity but I will not accept a game company making money off their own stupidity.","This is a super fun game and it really should have a higher score. However, I cannot get over the fact that you cannot have multiple islands on one console. Never in my life have I seen a game where you can\u2019t have save files for different users, and I think it\u2019s atrocious to believe that people will shell out the money for a second console just to play it separately. That is not how a game should work. I shouldn\u2019t be limited to what other people I play with are doing, and vice versa. That\u2019s not truly creating my own island, which is the whole appeal of the game. Nintendo, fix this. NOW.","\"#1 Best Switch Game of 2020\". Catch 10.000 fish in a minigame that requires 2 A-button presses, catch 10.000 bugs in a minigame that requires 1 A-button press, chop 10.000 wood, mine 10.000 ore, dig for 10.000 fossils, and pop 10.000 balloons/lootboxes for rare pieces of furniture. Click through the same repeating speech bubbles when interacting with your NPC villagers. Later in Animal Crossing: New Horizons you can also edit the layout of your 3D-level, piece by piece. One of the \"best games of 2020\" is a cumbersome 3D-level-editor in which you have to do busy work to gather randomly appearing 3D models of furniture, dress up your character, and outfit an empty museum which probably no one but yourself will visit. This whole \"game\" is like outfitting an empty museum which will never be visited by many interested visitors. That's about it, that is the extent of interaction this game provides - for the \"multiplayer\" part see almost every other review. The only feature that made me play this game 5 minutes a day for several days is the \"skinner box\", i.e. the variable rewards, i.e. the chance that maybe a rare piece of furniture appears in one of the balloons/lootboxes or in one of the ingame stores. But after you've placed your rare piece of furniture and after you've equipped your new fancy hat, there's just nothing much to do but grinding and looking at good looking 3D items.","0/10 one Nintendo Switch = one Island. I will not buy the game until you change it.","A wonderfully relaxing, peaceful and unique video game experience that won't be to everyone's taste, but for its target audience it will be like a dream come true.","Unfortunately game is effectively unplayable due to being the second person trying to play on the switch. Can't even buy a second cartridge to play my own game...","Bought this game for my girlfriend hoping she would get really into it (especially during isolation). She hasn't really taken to it yet so I've launched it on my Switch and am on my way to customising my own Island which i'm finding a lot of fun. This is my first ever experience of an Animal Crossing game and I think the perfect place to start as you go from barren unpopulated island to building a full community - I've never been into games like this but it is really addictive!\r Note: I'm fortunate in that I have my own original Switch and my girlfriend has the Switch Lite so the 1 island per console rule isn't hindering either of us. I hope for the rest of the people review bombing here that Nintendo do update it to 1 island per user because that is understandably very annoying!","This new animal crossing has some new things like crafting but not all new things are good.  Because you can't craft multiple, the time to craft craft things like fish bait is increased to an unacceptable amount.  Using fish bait as an example you need to 1. Go to bench and select craft something. 2. Select the recipe you want to craft 3. See a cute animation for crafting 4. Have your character exclaim they made the thing you told them to and 5. select craft something else.  Repeat as many times as you plan to craft, and this game is getting 10's?  Its good but no 10.  I give it an 8.  -1 for the lack of multicraft and -1 for requiring the lower version of a tool to craft the better version, thats adding steps again and has the same problems of multicraft.","TL;DR: This game locks out anyone wanting to share a console with a household by removing core game functions (story progression, infrastructure tools) to players 2 to 8, and only allows for complete collection of elements if players engage in local co-op with other game owenrs or they subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online (see below for details).\r 4.5 out of 10 seems a fair score to give a game that put in a huge amount of effort to create a beautiful, well executed, addictive game that alienates half its player base. For each player in a household to have the full experience, you would need to spend $408AUD per person ($79 for a copy of the game, $329 for a Nintendo Switch Lite). Safe to say, no game is worth $408.\r Here are some of the features that players 2 to 8 on a single game miss out on: Story elements, bundles of free recipes, and island editing tools (infrastructure projects, moving buildings/houses, terraforming).\rThis would be the equivalent of BotW only allowing the first person to boot the game to fight the Divine Beasts and Fight Ganon, but allowing all other players to collect hearts, stamina, and resources for player one.\rOr, it would be the same as only allowing the first player to boot up Super Mario Odyssey to collect moons, while every other player could only collect coins.\r Furthermore, none of the promotional materials, nor any reviews of the game have indicated that collecting all the materials within the game is capped for anyone looking for a purely single player experience. As an example, a single console and island has access to a maximum of half the fruit species available unless they engage in local co-op with another owner of the game, or subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online. Datamining revealed that players visiting Mystery Islands will only be exposed to their Native Fruit, and a \"Sister Fruit\". No matter how many Mystery Islands you visit, these will be the only two fruits you'll be exposed to.\r The shady nature of the promotions around collecting, combined with the lack of autonomy given to all players beyond player one, is why this game is getting slammed by players. That is why such a beautiful game, with addictive gameplay, does not deserve the full praise it deserves, when it is so clearly trying to force people into purchasing multiple copies and consoles to fulfil the experience.","This game really came with a huge change, compared to the previous ones, craft, the miles option, the evolution is being wonderful and has a lot to do differently from the old versions, I love it, and I hope that a dlc solves this problem of having just an island, and always bring new news and maybe an expansion! Congratulations Nintendo!\r Ps: i wish i could keep things out of the house in boxes or wardrobes and not need to enter the house to save, taking the option of customizing only for mirrors","The multiplayer is very underwhelming. And so limited. So many things that you can do in single player are turned off in online multiplayer mode, so when my friends came to visit my town I honestly found myself waiting for them to leave so I could get back to what I was doing. Also, when inviting  2, 3, or more players to your town everyone has to watch a cut scene when anyone lands or takes off. It becomes a long annoying process. And then people try to leave while others come in and it becomes this bottle neck traffic jam. It gets annoying.\r Otherwise the game is great for me, but I am not sharing my switch with anyone.","The best Animal Crossing edition yet! Amazing graphics and improved gameplay, I absolutely love it and it's the perfect thing to keep occupied with throughout this period of social distancing due to covid-19","It's a truly beautiful game. You can really tell how much care they put into this game with all the little details, leaves blowing in the wind and the way light hits and reflects off objects. I really enjoy the way custom designs smooth out the pixels now, as it allows for more versatile designs. The villager personalities are incredibly charming. It would take so many words to express how much I love this game, so I'm going to stop there. I've been waiting a long time for this game, and I'm so thrilled to be able to play it now. It is a good way to escape from reality during these dark times with quarantine and all that.","It's great! Lots to do and it isn't big thing to share an island with other players because you can also visit other people's islands.","Amazing new addition to the already awesome series! I love how much work the dev and design teams have put towards this game! It is truly a labour of love. Wonderful graphics, new dialogue, new villagers, new concepts, crafting, and improvements on existing concepts such as house decor, outfits, etc.","This is the best game of the series. It combines all of the best elements of the previous games and whips them into something magical, while still introducing new elements to create an overall fantastic game. It's also extremely aesthetically pleasing to look at, which is a huge plus. I bought the game the day it came out and cannot stop playing. While other games in the series I could only play for about 30 minutes out of the day before feeling bored or like there was nothing to do, I find myself playing this one for hours and still feeling like I could do more. Overall, amazing game, and I can't wait to play it for years to come.","Just about the happiest game available right now! The game continues with the cute AC style from all the other games, but gives you loads more options to customise your characters face, hair and outfit. It combines some of the home design from HHD and the crafting element of Pocket Camp to make the game different enough from its predecessors. It's a tad monotonous at times, just like all the AC games, but it's the perfect way to kill time while the world's on lock down! You can only have 1 Town per switch, but that's the same as all the previous AC games, like New Leaf and Wild World. There is always pleanty to do, but you can play at your own speed, getting lots done every day, or hardly anything at all!","An excellent addition to the Animal Crossing library. Gorgeous graphics and sound design. Nostalgic, but with many new things to explore!","Probably the best animal crossing game to date. Great for all-time players and new ones alike. The wait for the game was worth it, as it shows a leap from previous entries. It has good online play and charming characters. New options to explore and find things. It helps to relax, pass the time and interact. A great game overall. If you are scared by the mixed user reviews, just note, all of the negative ones complain on the lack of being able to have two islands in the same switch. I don't have this problem myself, but if you have no interest in having multiple islands do not hesitate on getting this game.","Really fun game! An update on the older games while keeping the charm of the series!","Annoyed at the astrological stuff as it's kinda wonky and very unclear what to do.  Been playing this like crazy for the last week though, so it's a great game with a couple annoyances for me personally.  Would have been a 9 if not for the draconian DRM Nintendo has on this title that's been affecting others.","This game makes me wanna throw up. 5 stars10 out of 10Love itFishing hardMake me wanna throw up","Premi\u00e8re fois que joue \u00e0 un animal crossing r\u00e9sultat je regrette pas de l'avoir pris une merveille","Tom nook:You must give me a 98000bells10 hours latter....Korean:98000bellsTom:uh... thanks","Awesome.\rI don't get how so many peoples rate 0 just because a second player option... I don\u2019t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward.","If rate this game a 7.5 but going with 8 because of so many unfair reviews here. My critiques:1) There are less fruit &amp; shop varieties than NL. I wish nooks could be upgraded past a shed in this game.2) storage system could really be optimized in several ways-at least as an \"unlock\" feature. Could use a lot more storage space overall. But things like letting work benches store materials, or having ways to access storage outside of your home would be great quality of life features that don't exist right now.3) wish the map had a villager &amp; visitor key/tracker since the island is (nicely!) Big. Hard to find anyone tho.4)I miss being able to unlock services to hire people to water plants and deweed for me in the end game. I miss the being able to select building projects and have villagers occasionally help submit bells for the cause.5) NL had games you could play with your villagers randomly and have events where they'd either invite you over or request to hang out with you in your home..I have many hours in and haven't seen this. (They'd also be willing to part with furniture and such)To be clear, ACNH *added* many features but also took away some that I enjoyed. The #1 issue with this game is you can only have one island per switch ...youd have to buy an entirely different system if you have more than one person who wants to play their own file. I don't see this restriction on any other switch game I own so this feels very dissapointing as a decision even if it doesn't apply to my household situation. The switch system is pricey and families probably were caught off guard by this.I still love this game and am enjoying it. The new features I won't spoil are great.","A MUST own for Nintendo Switch!\r By far the most comprehensive and best Animal Crossing experience.\r The graphics are great in handheld, but REALLY pop at a level never before seen in docked mode.\r The soundtrack is very chill and absolutely WILL get stuck n your head.\r This is a very chill game - perfect for all of us stressed out, over worked, and quarantined people!","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an incredible game and I'm so happy it came out at a time when people are locked inside. Even after our current events have subsided I expect to be playing this game for a very long time. No other game has the charm of AC and I just can't wait for what else this game has in store as the seasons change.\r I understand many are upset about the limitation of 1 island per console but to review bomb such a great game for this and give it 0,1,2,3/10 is insane. Vent and release your frustration elsewhere if you can't be mature and give an honest rating.","This is my first Animal Crossing game. Generally, I don't like these types of games, but I don't understand what exactly it is about this game, but I can't stop playing.","The game is great in some aspects, and really bad in some others/\rWhat i really like in the game:\r- The detail of everything in the game\r- The, mostly, well written dialogues\r- The relaxing vibe of the game\r What i dislike in the game:\r- Having the same dialogue every time for basic functions (this is also the rare case where the dialogues are not well written, surprisingly) like selling things or turning something in to the museum\r- Being allowed only one island per Switch\r- The apparent randomness of some things like stacking items (some stack to 99, some to 10, some don't stack at all, etc.)\r What really grinds my gears in the ame:\r- The horrendous multiplayer. Clicking through 8 dialogues, watching an obnoxious cutscene that also plays for ALL other players in the island you go to and not being able to do basic things when your island is open for other players.\r- The speed at which tools breaks, even the improved ones. Making tools over and over and over get's RALLY tedious after a while.\r- The placing of items outside your house is absolutely terrible, where you have to hope that you 'aimed' correctly. This get's more apparent when you want to move, for example, a house, and you misplace it by 1-2 tiles, after which you have to pay to move it again.\r All in all, i have some enjoyment at times in the game, but the mentioned issues really keep me from enjoying the game to the fullest. If some those points would be improved upon, this game would be magnificent, but for now i can not give it more than a 6/10.","I have been playing animal crossing since i was a very young child on the gamecube. I\u2019ve played every version and each time it has progressively gotten better and better. This is such a beautiful representation of how far the game has come. There are so many little details that make my heart sing like rain on windows, breeze in trees, and such elaborate shadowing and lighting. I recommend this game to everyone. Everyone should play animal crossing, young and old. It brings people together and helps you unwind when you\u2019re feeling stressed. Its also not to get addicted to such a beautiful game.","This is, overall, a really great experience. I can say in full confidence that you will like this game. Even if you think you won't; in fact, this game probably has the most positive impact on people who don't think they'll like it. From the perspective of someone who's played every game in the series since the DS, I can also vouch for this one is easily the best.\r Aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience I'll get to in a minute, this game's new ideas shine. There's a lot of quality-of-life changes, but in typical Animal Crossing fashion, it's still kinda bad. For example, you don't have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want, so long as you have the materials to do so. But you can't craft the same thing in bulk, so if you have 19 manilla clams, you're gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bummer. It's still not easy to time-travel, which I understand makes me automatically the worst person on Earth and the bane of some Tumblr users' existence, but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it. Especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is... not good. It's bad. It sucks. You just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80% of the bells you would've made if you'd just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly, so it completely misses the point. But again, it's really not that big a deal.\r That stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10, but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here. I've told this to each of my friends individually, and I'll say it again: buy this game. Do it.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an extremely relaxing game. Like the games before it, you are moved into a small town and make it a thriving community. Though previous games had multiplayer, New Horizons does it extremely well. If you have patience, it is extremely satisfying","Although the game is cute and can be quite addictive even though I enjoy playing it there are a lot \u00e0 things that could be improved .. I find that they put little effort  into the story line.. I am new to the animal crossing universe and brought this game to see what the fuss was all about and was soon dispointed.. The game play feels more like a game you'd get on the app store, you have to wait till the next day to progress which gets a bit frustrating and the story line was rather short. Also the amount of menus/dialogue get really repetative and tedious too.","Only one island per system alowed. Being the second player sucks. I don't want to be forced to buy another console.","First, let me concede that the game is really fun BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOLO!\r The fact that the progress of second-and-additional players is limited by the progress of the first player is a showstopper for this game ever becoming a classic.  The Switch offers multiple separate user profiles so that games can be, well, separate.  The forced sharing of an island and the fact that the island rep gets game features that the other players don't get ruins the experience for any family/roommates//etc. that are using the same console.  The option to share an island should be just that: an option.  If in my own profile I want my own island with my own game experience, that should be possible.  I enjoyed the game for a few hours until I realized how limited I was by being player 2 and now there is no motivation to play any further.","Muy adictivo la comunidad es genial horas y horas de juego uno de los juegos m\u00e1s completos que aya jugado .","Great next step in the franchise that builds more into the game than the basic functions of the predecessors. Enjoyable and addicting.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the newest Game in the Animal Crossing Franchise and for me, It is the best. The cute look is very beautiful and I love it when i wake up and go to my switch to see what's happening. I took 1 point away because the dialoges in the game are very long.","Wow best game of the year!  So much replay value it's insane!  And now with this new Nature event there is even more stuff to do!  Even the island vendor had some special things I've really be needing for my gardens.  I'm just so in love with this game.  :)  REPLAY VALUE!!","Although the one island per console restriction can, understandably, be annoying for families and people sharing a Switch, I believe that the game is still a wonderful package for any Animal Crossing fan.","I grew up with animal crossing, from Wild World to New Leaf I couldn\u2019t miss out on New Horizons. I played the game the day it released and it\u2019s become part of my daily schedule ever since then. The game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise. Like Minecraft once said \u201cthe only limit is your creativity\u201d and that fits perfectly for this game. Almost unlimited design options from planting flowers to terraforming mountains and waterfalls allows players to practically play god and do whatever their heart desires. The start of the game is a bit slow and tedious as players try to get all the buildings and upgrades so you can do as you will. The core part of the game is building a community with these adorable animals that will populate your town that have their own personalities and preferences. Featuring many popular returning faces including Tom nook, Timmy and Tommy, Isabelle, able sisters, Leif and many more you are bound to reunite with your childhood favorites. Collecting different rare fish, bugs, and fossils is a main component of the game and can be, annoying, at times but makes you feel accomplished apon collection. Multiplayer is something I use frequently in the game and I\u2019ve discovered it to be, boring. No mini games, annoying communication, and limited interaction forces players to come up with their own things to do (or just awkwardly stand next to each other and doing emotes). Multiplayer is good for trading but that\u2019s honestly about it from what I\u2019ve personally experienced. In a game where you can do almost anything there is something for everyone here and can bring some peace to even the rowdiest of souls. With no violence, swears, drugs, or sexual references this is almost a \u201cshell shock\u201d being seen as one of the best selling games of the year so far. This game allows me to stress out about where to put my flowers instead of stressing out about deadlines and drama and is a nice feeling that only this game can deliver. I can see this being part of my daily schedule for months to come and I always look forward to what new exciting thing will happen on my island each day.","Fun game to pass time. Especially in the current climate of world lock downs.  Ignore the zero ratings,  A zero rating should be reserved for games that don\u2019t even boot up. Any zeros you see are just from people being petty over a particular feature they don\u2019t like. Those things aren\u2019t game breaking just annoyances.  I would have really rated this game a 9 for lack of multiple islands but threw it up to 10  to counteract the other reviews.","Never got into AC before this release. Have had a lot of fun with this game. It\u2019s a game I can enjoy with both my wife and daughter without much fuss. Easy to pick up for quick bites and also easy to sit down and kill a ton of time messing about. Some of the tools/controls can be a bit wonky, and the single island per system thing keep this from getting a higher score from me. Tl:dr: fun, enjoyable with family and friends. Couple of odd bits keep it from being amazing.","This game is amazing and would be perfect, but there is one huge flaw. Only one island per switch. That means only one person can truly make decisions on the island and move things forward. I just paid $60 for this game. I\u2019m not going to buy another switch and buy the game again just to have another island for my kids(but only one because of the stupid island rule). If they changed this one thing, I would give this game a 10. I\u2019m so disappointed in Nintendo. I bought into the peaceful game where nothing goes wrong thing","highly frustrating and tedious user interface,sure its a slow casual wind down game but u dont have to go as far as monologue after EVERY action. Also the chores u gotta do to add your friend ingame.Etc","I would absolutely love to give this game a 10.  I have always loved this series as a way to just sit back and relax.   BUT. This entry has terribly let me down, with the single island system. I started out fine. Played for a few hours.  Then handed it off to my five year old.  I come back to find everything I've done moved around or deleted. (I did not previously know about the single island.  OR the fact that only the main player can progress.    Please fix this issue.","Perhaps i am being to harsh on the game and went in with high expectations. I have never played an Animal crossing game up to this point but i played stardew valley and thought it was pretty great. While playing it i would get onto web forums and that is where i heard a lot about animal crossing and how it was the game that started these types of games. Some people would even say they were playing stardew valley while waiting for the coveted  animal crossing new horizons game.  I got into the hype and i felt like Nintendo was on a role with their in house games so i pre-ordered it for me and my wife.\r Here is the reasons why i am disappointed with the game.\r 1. All the profiles on a switch play on the same island. At first this sounded interesting and it felt like our house would have its own community. What makes this annoying is that you are on an island with finite daily resources so if my wife plays before me she could take most of the resources on our island. Granted I could spend nook miles to go to a random island to get resources but it was really disappointing searching the island for leftovers.\r 2. This First person to play the game can impact the progression of everyone else playing. This person becomes the island representative and they get assigned objectives that lead to the islands growth. I let my wife play first and I found my self waiting her to build some buildings and could not participate the same way. My profile can only do the side objectives. It felt like the idea of there being two people playing the game on one the same switch was an after thought. Or a greedy money grabbing attempt from Nintendo.\r 3. Most craftable items are just decorative. In games like the sims, minecraft, and  Stardew Valley you had decorative items but also a lot of items the are functional. Like a stove to cook food or a bike to make you travel faster. In animal crossing I made a bike and a stove and they just sit there and I can't use them. It makes crafting kind of boring because you don't create something useful. I have an interior design app on my phone and it feels kind of like animal crossing.\r 4. Social media seems to be a big part of this game. One of the cool things about this game is that your island is unique and what grows on your island does not nessarly grow on a friends island. For example Apples grew on my island and peaches grew on my sisters island. In order to get different  resources you either need to get extremely lucky and find them on a mysterious island or trade with a friend. If someone is your friend on the switch you still have to friend them in animal crossing. It is independent of your switch friends. The best way to trade is to get on social media or forums.  This would not be so annoying if switch had a mic built into the console. Instead I found myself having to type everything out. What made it more annoying is that my wife (the island rep) did not have switch online for her account. So the person who had the most important role could not do online trading. If you are going to force us to share an island then this island should have a shared subscription. I started getting bored because i was not the representative but my account was online so i had to do the trades.\r 5.Multiplayer is not that fun. Couch co -op is in the game, but to play it you need to have a profile and a character made on the island . For couch co-op the second player is forced to follow the first player and can not keep any resources. In Online multiplayer you can't do things like move decorations while someone is visiting your island. Online players can keep the resources they take from your island.\r 6.Lack of goals. It wants to be like minecraft in this aspect and wants you to choose your own path. Minecraft is massive with so much to explore and learn about, animal crossing is small and most island feel the same. Stardew Valley is also small but you can explore with crafting and i remember  gathering resources just to see what a crafted item does. In animal crossing the most exciting things are a new visitor, a large fish shadow, or a bug that can attack you. It just does not have enough different things for me to do or learn about to care or get lost in.\r 7.NPC relationships do not really feel like they progress. I don't feel like my npc's see me more as a friend than when they first came. Npcs with the same personality they start to get repetitive in conversations. Don't get me wrong there are some interesting things that they do but it seems few and far between.\r 8. The real time can be annoying when joined with the problems above. Basically i play the game at night after my wife and the nook shop closes. You can put stuff in a box to sell but you get penalized and lose 20%. It is annoying because when you start the game the shop is open 24/7.  If you work late you might be inconvenience by this game.\r Overall it feels like a grind for both me and my wife.","I hate you guys for omitting the ability to play with separate islands. It's just a tactic to try to sell more switch systems and it's a downright dirty trick. If you want to make more money off of the game sell it for a higher price, don't force your players to buy another console to play the game their way. I made an island not knowing the tricky tactics you guys were pulling and my partner is now left out of the fun unless I seriously limit my own game play. I'm about to just get rid of the game.  Screw this!","The inability to have multiple islands on the console make this game useless for families.","As a person who is a longtime Nintendo fan and supporter I can\u2019t stand behind The ugly cash grab that is ACNH. This is a game that wants to frustrate you to the point that you will go out and spend an additional 360$ for a new Switch and another copy of animal crossing. Not only is the one island representative bad enough. Couple that with extremely limited couch co op where second player doesn\u2019t have access to do anything other than chop trees and watch logs Poof to the recycle bin. Made miserable by the fact that you have to leader swap and go nick them up if you actually want to retrieve them. I\u2019m sorry but until this is fixed in my opinion this game is absolute trash and have no desire to play. Bought this title to play with my wife and daughter. As a longtime gamer I thought I would be able to find work around for the current problem and is is possible but so completely tedious that it completely ruins the experience for me. Nintendo\u2019s already got my money and probably the money of several thousands of people just like me. So I really doubt Nintendo is going to fix their stupid cash grab. This game could have been a masterpiece instead it is a Dumpster fire ","Hi,Great game, I love it, but... I don\u2019t get why there is only one island per console??? I don\u2019t think  anyone would have the money for that many Nintendo switches, I know the past games haven\u2019t gone so well in some countries but that\u2019s no reason to make it only one island!? It is the only reason that this game is not the best game. If you fix this in the next update, I bet even more people would want to buy it!From Milla. 8 years old. I cried because my mummy didn\u2019t get to have her own island.","I really wish I could give this a better review. If the save system was like any other game where multiple users could have their own island, then it would be a 9. But forcing people to share islands is disappointing to say the least. Instead of being able to collect resources like every one else, you\u2019re forced to compete for resources, thereby slowing everyone\u2019s progress. Additionally, unless you\u2019re the person to create the island you\u2019re treated as a second class citizen who doesn\u2019t get to help out with any of the projects that progress the island. At one point you have to build furniture and decorations for 3 villagers, but only the Resident Representative can see what\u2019s needed, let alone turn them in. You can work together to build the items and give them to the RR, but that\u2019s more cumbersome than it should be.If my daughter hadn\u2019t used her allowance to buy a digital copy then I\u2019d look into returning it. But she\u2019s 7, and loves the game, so I wouldn\u2019t do that to her even if it was possible to return digital copies of games.  Of course, since she bought it she gets to be the Resident Representative, so of course she loves it.","why  can only the very first player who went on the island  run errands for the racoon(?) and  get the necessary DIY functions for free other players on the same island have to buy the functions by bells and don't  know how the island is going on unless the first player told them","As primary user, I'd give this game a 3. As secondary, I would give a 1. First 10 hours of the game are exciting and filled with possibilities but the pace slows significantly as you run out of things to discover. Unless you like designing and organizing, it's unlikely you'll spend more than 20 minutes per day paying. Absolute biggest mistake was only allowing 1 island per switch. The entire point of this game is gathering resources and collecting. When you have to share your resources with someone else the game becomes pointless and a waste of money. I dont see any good reason for this rule, to me it's unfathomable for a company to have such a brainless flaw.","My parents bought this for me (16) and my little sister (9) \u2018s birthdays. It was a shared gift. As, cuz of the pandemic this was our main gift ( it was my main gift besides a necklace for my sweet sixteen &lt; which thanks to quarantine I got to spend with no friends) I was so greatly looking forward to having a little island to get away to, but the morning we received it my sister got up at like 6am and went straight to it, she named it (spelt the name of the island wrong) and played on. Nonetheless when I came downstairs I was so excited to do the same, but then I noticed something odd, I didn\u2019t get to create my own island. I became a \u201cside character\u201d in my nine year old sisters island. It was devastating, I tried to go along and play anyways but I\u2019ve decided to give up, once I realized I won\u2019t get to move lots or do ANYTHING BIG TO CUSTOMIZE the island it\u2019s worthless to me. It makes me so sad to see her play the game and I wish I could do all the things she does, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t get to do much but chop wood and run around","Eh its alright. Some really neat ideas have been implemented but it seems like the devs took the Todd Howard approach and left out way too many features from the previous games that made the series so beloved. Music is boring and uninspired. NPCs are one dimensional and lack personality. There also just isn't that much to do in the game. I can see why people new to Animal Crossing would think this game is great, and it is fun for a small amount of time. However, those who grew up with animal crossing may be disappointed with how far the game has strayed from the original concepts.","I really loved Animal Crossing New Leaf and I thought this game would introduce new things, but I was wrong. And they really downgraded on the fun factor. No new personality types, dead villagers who only mention the HHA score and fossils. They might as well all be the same personality type. Graphics aren't everything and this game is given way too much credit for what it is. Boring.","This score is for playing the game when you're a second class citizen. If you happen to be the first person in your family who boots up the game, great. You'll have a better experience.Everyone else who wants to play on the console, you're out of luck. You will not be able to play the game to its full extent. The one island per console limitation is probably one of the worst decisions ever made in gaming. On top of that, only the \"main\" player can advance the island. Not knowing this, I spent a lot of time thinking there was a major bug in the game. When I found out it was a feature, I was surprised and not in a good way.It's not likely it's because of a Switch technical limitation, as the Switch is able to maintain separate save files for every profile for just about every other game, including games more complex than Animal Crossing.This is just a poor design decision or a bad tactic to try to sell more consoles. Seems Nintendo dreams of every person in a family having their own Switch. Well guess what, not going to happen. Just going to get tons of negative reviews instead.","La mejor entrega de la saga por descontado.

Yes, one island PER CONSOLE. Not game, not account, but PER CONSOLE.\r Nintendo is being incredibly greedy, and is probably also desperate to push Switches out the door before the next gen arrives.","It's Animal Crossing. It's always been Animal Crossing. And while they add some quality of life improvements to the game and some more polish, it's still pretty much the same game you've played since the DS era.\r And the game still suffers from it's biggest drawback. Animal Crossing is a game that has no direction, it's about you personally finding stuff to do. And unfortunately, everything there is to do is the same mundane schlock you've come to expect from every other previous iteration of the game.\r The \"mystery islands\" could have been a nice touch, but they are a quarter of the size of the normal island. Islands are picks from a small selection of pre-made islands instead of being procedurally generated. So instead of constantly finding new islands, after a weeks worth of playing the game, you'll begin to constantly see the same island types over and over again.\r The developers made an attempt to give you more to do, but it ends up boiling down to being rewarded for doing the same stuff you have always done instead, while locking rewards behind \"Nook Miles\", a secondary form of currency in the game. The end result is, they've managed to already take a core mechanic from the game and turn it in to even more of a grind than it was before.\r Animal Crossing's popularity isn't surprising; it was simply a coincidence, it managed to be released around the same time a massive pandemic was taking place. If it weren't for that, I doubt it would be getting such high accolades from people, because at the end of the day, this version is just as mediocre as any of the other releases.\r For whatever insane reason, Nintendo has also decided to put in a bunch of really weird restrictions to the game that are ultimately unhelpful, frustrating and counterproductive to what a game should be.\r Animal Crossing needs to be BETTER, not the same.","Game is good in theory, it's fun during this time of COVID. However, and this is critically important, Nintendo treats its customers horribly. WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?! Microsoft and Sony both have implemented sweeping and positive changes to their multiplayer and online capabilities. Nintendo refuses to listen to anyone. They are tone deaf and it's honestly offensive how dismissive they are of feedback. Quick to patch exploits but the fact that if my Switch breaks, which happens all the time due to their horrible hardware quality, you are screwed. This is an egregious miss on their part. Nintendo has to fix this or people will abandon this game in droves. Nintendo needs to grow up and get with the times before they become obsolete again.","Too much review bombing over the single island thing. No, the game isnt 100% flawless but what game is?  Every day you find something new. It's entertaining, sweet, and nearly endless.  I am a companion account. My wife is the main account.  I have no problem playing and enjoying myself.  It's more a single player game with multiplayer capabilities.  Not a multiplayer multi island type of game.  1 island per copy.","Turnip price is always less then what I paid for turnips...

As long as you don't have to share your Switch with someone else, this is a very fun game and I highly recommend it.","It\u2019s a brilliant and great game that builds and expands on the amazing success it has had in prior iterations!

I got it\u2026\rThe Good of animal crossing new horizons is its addictive and calming, a game all about chosing the layout of your island and building it, letting it flourish.. learning new items to craft, becoming friends with your neighbors, ctaching bugs, fishing, collecting shells.. palnting flowers, planting trees.. just enjoying the breaze through your Nintendo switch, all on your journey to make your newly aquired island livable.. you can earn cash by selling these items you collect and use this cash to buy items to furnish your home or pay of your debts to obtain an even bigger and better home\u2026 its  anice little carrot at the end of this stick, collect, craft, design until youre statisfied.. there is no end goal here.. this is a game all about playing until youre done.. not until the game is done.. until you are done, until youre bored of it.. as this is a game meant to be played throughout the years to come.. stopping in for an hr or so a day, slowly progressing your island\u2026 and onto the bad of animal crossing progression here is far too slow, it took me 6 real time days to do anything beyond fish or collect bugs\u2026 as once again this game runs in real time, when youre told a building will be done tomorrow, the game literally means tomorrow, but for the sake of this review I time skipped with the switches settings.. I get that this is a game meant to be chipped away at, but I feel its ridiculous to expect someone to invest 6 days into a game they just purchased before things start getting good\u2026 and the only other bad here is coop.. you cant share your nintendo switch with your significant other or siblings\u2026 one switch shares an island.. but other than those 2 huge knocks theres everything here an animal crossing fan could want\u2026 and for those into games they can hop into to relax, destress, and decorate a little, catch some bugs or fish, dig some fossils for the museum..\rThe decorator in you, the collector in you.. both will shine with excitement for hours\u2026\rFor me personally Animal Crossing New Horizon got 10 hours out of me before I was over it.. but its okay to be over it.. This is what makes this game so special, Theres no pressure, everything is at your pace, and the day or hour you decide to leave your island is a day youll look back with memories of collecting or gathering this, the moment you spent inside of your head as you fished.\rAnimal Crossing New Horizons is one giant exhale.\rI give Animal Crossing: New Horizons\ran 8/10","I understand the criticisms of the folks that scored this game low but the information concerning the 'one island per switch' was announced and discussed almost a year prior to game's release.\rI don't disagree with it being a poor decision on Nintendo's part AND it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't do it as a marketing tool to promote Switch sales but it wasn't a secret - the information was readily available on several sites prior to the game's release.","as someone who really loved Stardew Valley I was really excited to try this game but honestly it's been disappointing.

Stardew Valley leaves a lot to explore and do!\r the controls aren't nice. I don't like how you have to wait for the flowers to sparkle to tell if they're watered . with a lot nearby it's not a nice way. a lot of the mechanics like donating to the museum feel so unrewarding. I feel no reason to do it. unlike stardew valley that I donated every first of any item I got there.\r stardew valley is simply 20x better and costs less than half as much when not on sale.\rit started of very fun but they haven't managed to make the tasks rewarding. there's just something about the animations the speed of them and the rewards that you get for them that makes this game not fun. and I LOVE games like this. farming stuff and the type where you get stuff and unlock more new stuff. this is my fav genre of games so it's not a \"I only like call of duty\" kind of issue, They just haven't made it work well for me. But a lot of my friends absolutely love it so yeah. It sadly doesn't have a demo. but a demo would be unfair since the first week of this game is actually fun since your'e showered with new items and don't have much time consuming but boring tasks to do.","Absolutely MEH\r Like most Switch owners, I was very excited for this release.  I felt like this would be a great game to enjoy with the wife and our 8 year old daughter.  The game looks very cute and the characters are adorable.  The graphics are easily the biggest +. The concept itself is great but the execution is just terrible.  This game was released before it was finished.  Its as simple as that.  This is not a complete game.  There isn't really any campaign which is just preposterous. It would have been so easy to send your character on a variety of cute quests to help the islands residents, but no... Everything about this game, aside from the graphics need to be refined.  It feels like no one tested this game before it was released.  There is a long list of issues that should have been fixed prior to release.  No option to craft multiple items (unbelievable).  Not enough resources to craft things (even if youre prepared to grind).  Terrible controls for building (its a crafting game but you feel very limited in what you can do and where you can place things).  Not enough quests.  Seriously just preposterous.  Even the mobile version of this game has better quests.  All you do is keep paying off enormous loans to build up your house, its just an endless grind that isn't very creative or innovative.  This game is the definition of half-baked. I wont even get into the fact that its only one island per console.  In my opinion Dragon Quest Builders II is a much better game if you want to play a crafting type game.  There are just so many things about this game that aggravate me when its being touted as a game that is enjoyable and relaxing.  I guess I will give it a 3 because of the beautiful graphics, otherwise I would be hard pressed to pay $20 for this half baked rubbish","It\u2019s a fine game but I got bored pretty quickly and the coop is so bad that it\u2019s practically unplayable with 2 people.","Animal Crossing es la clara prueba de que Nintendo no solo sigue haciendo videojuegos \u00fanicos sino que adem\u00e1s esta en plena forma.","El mismo juego que tuvimos en new leaft de 3ds la diferencia es que tienes menos opciones ya no puedes bucear ay menos tiendas las opciones de ir de viaje son menos (antes podias salir de paseo al asar con alguien ) aparte de que esta rotisimo el online aparte de que ahora es de paga tiene menos actividades ya no ay minijuegos con los amigos","Amazing game!

I thing it must be nominated to Game of the year","animalitos para ni\u00f1as juego infumable aburrido mas de lo mismo no pierdan el tiempo jugando a esta busura","Cute, but tedious and more of a long chore than an engaging game. That's the impression I've been left with after 40 hours with Animal Crossing, and I'm honestly surprised I lasted that long. Then again, it is designed to get you playing every day as you're drip fed progress whilst you do the same boring tasks every day like picking up stones one by one or fishing where you can't move your line after casting it without just casting it again altogether. There's a lot of quality of life improvements that could be made here that even fans of this game have to admit, like being able to craft multiple items at once, for example. There's a lot of repeat dialogue that gets annoying as well, and when you give Blathers a new fish, insect or fossil in the museum you have to click through the same bunch of stuff every time for every item you bring before he'll tell you an interesting fact about it.\r I can see the appeal a game like this might have to some people, as it is an escape from the real world where everything is pretty chill and you can design your island as you please. I found it really stressful though, and I know that might seem weird to some people. But the daily grind got to me, slowly ticking off those menial tasks and stressing over how to decorate my home. That might sound silly but if you're not the most creative person or you fuss over the little things, you might get a little stressed too.\r There are some things I liked. It's got a very cute aesthetic and the museum is a really nice way to show off all the things you've caught and found. There's a lot of freedom in what you wear, and how you design your island and house which is great for creatives.\r I wish I could've loved this game like it's many fans do, but I found it boring and stressful. It's got the Nintendo polish you'd expect, but also some quirks about not being able to have islands linked to individual accounts instead of the console that many people have complained about. Overall, I'd have to score this game 6/10. I might check it out again some time down the line, as it is getting updated with new seasonal events but I doubt those would fix my personal issues with the game.","El mejor juego de toda la saga animal crossing un gr\u00e1ficos muy pulidos la personalizaci\u00f3n es incre\u00edble la isla llena de vida y carisma.

And I 100% agree. Upon starting this game, the player realizes how much of a time sink this game is. The first literal week of playing is a dull time. If the game progressed at the early game's pace it would be a failure. that being said, once you get the ladder things pick up dramatically. Animal Crossing evolves so wonderfully into this symphony of good vibes that you can't help but smile. everything is charming. The idle pose for your villager is putting his arms on his hips, similar to how I feel every time I do something right. there are 3 big downsides if you play this game. Online Multiplayer is a slog and really uninteresting. In fact, it takes a minute for anyone to even join your island. Nintendo has never seemed to understand how online multiplayer works, this game only proves that. The 2nd downside is the slow start. The first week or so is a disappointment. Nothing seems to ever happen. you get told to do menial tasks with the goal of god knows what. the clunky tedium of every action gets on your nerve quick. the 3rd thing is no mini-games. in the first Animal Crossing, you could unlock a bunch of NES games to play. there isn't any equivalent in New Horizons. the closest thing is running away from bees/spiders. the tedium is the gameplay. If you want action and adventure, Do not buy this game, If you want a serene yet flawed experience I would recommend.","This is advertised as a multiplayer game but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a one player game that a second person can join in and watch.

With thousands of fish, bugs, fossils, paintings, furniture, and clothing items this game will keep anyone busy. It's very slow.

If you mess up you just wasted twice the amount of time on one space. 9/10\r As someone who doesn't share their console with other people I never felt like I was in the backseat. However, I have taken a point off for the highly flawed multi-user experience as I feel it does take away from the game.  8/10","A very relaxing game to play and a time sinker as well. The only complaint I have is the one island per switch situation, and the fact that you can't craft multiple items at once.","Animal Crossing is an experience which is definitely not for everyone. The game has charming graphics and calming sound effects, music. The gameplay is amazing and from what I have seen this is in my opinion the best Animal Crossing game. I would give this a 10/10 if didn't handle save file recovery like this. I really wish that I could back up my saves to the cloud so if I lost my Switch I wouldn't need to hope that Nintendo accepts my one time save file recovery proposal. I haven't lost my Switch once, but I really don't wanna risk it. I see a lot of people giving this game awful reviews just because you can only have one island per console. Grow up. I understand that some people might want more consoles if their entire family plays on the console, but please don't give the game 1/10 reviews only for that. As this is my first Animal Crossing game I can surely say that it is 100% worth the price! But just keep in mind that it's not for everyone.","This game oozes charm from the very first moments.

The one island per one switch, only the first player can advance the game, the second player is basically the first player's **** boy, and the one thing that really pisses me off is that after a few days...it's just boring.  I know it's a slow paced life sim, but damn, after 20 to 30 minutes I'm done doing things for the day.  It's 2020 and ACNH is on the Nintendo Switch, but the game just seems like it is either unfinished or has less content to keep you interested each day than New Leaf.  It's not horrible, but after hearing all the hype about playing together with friends, you would think you could actually play and build things together with your friends instead of this \"I am in charge and you will do all my bidding at my pace\" crap.","Hours of fun so far.

Era obvio que iba a pasar eso, basta que alguien tenga mala conexi\u00f3n para que se arruine la experiencia, as\u00ed que nintendo, que mucha gente pida algo no implica que siempre sea lo correcto.\rEra muy obvio que eso iba a ocurrir.\r Ahora con lo de la isla... \u00bfAmigo, alguna vez jugaste un AC anterior??? De cuando que en una consola puede hacer que exista un terreno o isla para cada usuario o aldeano? JAM\u00c1S.\rObviamente el encargado de la isla (el primero) tendr\u00e1 los privilegios a como el alcalde del ACNL.\r\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la sorpresa? La respuesta es clara. JAM\u00c1S JUGARON ALG\u00daN AC y s\u00f3lo lo hicieron porque para hacer videos para youtube o por la moda, por no decir POSSERS que no saben nada de la franquicia.\r Ahora ojal\u00e1 nintendo pueda habilitar en un futuro parche el que el alcalde o encargado pueda otorgar permisos mientras se juegan entre varios.\r Lo que no me gust\u00f3 es que ya no hay m\u00fasica entre horas. Era algo m\u00e1gico dependiendo de la hora y el tiempo (clima) y ahora al parecer es siempre la misma, salvo lo cambias con canela??\rEso me doli\u00f3, deber\u00edan de haberlo dejado como siempre y al menos dar la opci\u00f3n de que suene una canci\u00f3n siempre cuando se quiera en algunos casos.\r Son cosas que a futuro pueden ser mejoradas con parches y actualizaciones, as\u00ed que no tengo miedo en que nintendo haga esas cosas a futuro.\r Es muy bonito juego y los fans reales del AC estamos content\u00edsimos.\rMe llegar\u00e1 hate por parte de algunos, pero la verdad duele dicen, sorry si les he ofendido.\r Si eres nuevo en esta franquicia, tendr\u00e1s la suerte de jugar al m\u00e1s completo de todos los AC que te prometer\u00e1 horas infinitas de diversi\u00f3n y customizaci\u00f3n. No dudes en comprarlo porque una vez que empiezas, ya es muy dificil parar.\r La creatividad e imaginaci\u00f3n es tu \u00fanico l\u00edmite en este juego.","Excellent game, this title is a very good

aggravating but it's not game breaking and it's tolerable...what is not is the amount of Zero ratings because of the issue, I'm going to say this once but grow up and stop **** on our fun","Fantastico, credo che dare uno 0 come voto per una cosa mai promessa sia veramente sciocco.","The series has been very formulated up to this point, but New Horizons adds a lot of new fun aspects to the game without changing the identity of the franchise.","This is the best AC, the graphics looks so nice and the gameplay is enjoyful. I have spent about 50 hours since last friday and I cant stop playing it. The game is BEAUTIFUL.","This is probably, no definitely the best Animal Crossing game yet. The objective system is great, and starting from a desolate island and ending with a thriving village is incredible. The multiplayer, at least local, could use some work, bad its not as bad as some people would have you think. Online is fine, and its how I expected, if not a little clunkier. The limitation of one town per switch I see could bother some people, but I know quite a few that love living in one town together with their family. Overall, the game is solid, and I wouod reccomend it to everyone.","Not an actual review of the game, but one island per switch limitation is anti consumer ****","Sad I've felt like I had to give this score but inevitable. I'm a parent and also gamer, bought this for our whole family to play similar to how we did on new leaf. Sharing islands isn't an issue for us it makes it more enjoyable, the games quaint and addictive, with one MAJOR flaw. You cannot hold multiple islands like on new leaf with game save data.The saves for this game do not save to profile save date or to memory cards but directly to the console meaning multiple world is completely off the table. Not a huge problem some people say. Well, when my 6 year old was made thiwr avatar first it became an issue.  They don't play as much as myself and husband of course and us mainly being responsible for the building of the town's and helping our younger chikdren gather materials etc just became a nightmare: even more so that only the primary character can accept any quests. Therefore in order to all play and build our own characters means we either have to progress our 6 year olds character beyond what they are after or sacrifice our own progression. Badly thought put system.","Best game ever if you don't have to share your island with anyone. I feel it was designed for people between 25 and 30 years old.Don't miss this game just because the low ratings due to the one island per console issue, if you live alone you won't regret!","Just like every Animal Crossing game this is chill fun game. I play it about a hour a day or longer if I'm playing with friends. It lets you pretty much place furniture anywhere so you can really make the island your own.","The game feels tedious and doesn't feel like a AAA game. A lot of the mechanics are so monotonous. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to go through the menu every. Single. Time. to craft. So if you want to craft 10 hot items, you have to go through the process 10 times with so many button presses when they easily could've let us craft a stack of items like Minecraft. I don't think the developers tested the game cuz if they did, they'd realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are. Also after you unlock terraforming, you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block. It took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if I didn't have to sit through the annoying animation for every block. They easily could've made it so we could break or build multiple things at once but like I said, it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be \"relaxing\" which it's not. It's annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds. The villagers are also boring. In AC on the GameCube, the villagers had personality, felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend. In this game, they all basically say the same stuff, they're all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture. On top of that, they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in Pocket Camp. That's right, a $60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game. Also 1 island per switch is the worst move I've seen from Nintendo in a long time and they should've fixed it. I tried to get into this game but whenever I try to catch bugs, fish, build stuff or get bells, the enjoyment is quickly ruined by how boring and monotonous everything is. This game could be way better if they fixed a few things but guarantee they wont","Great game! I have never played animal crossing before, and hesitated buying it, because I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it. I really am loving it, though. You get this warm feeling of being part of a community, and the characters feel really alive. Unlocking new recipes, buildings and islanders gives a sense of progression I didn't think the game would have, and it's pretty cool seeing the island grow more and more each day that passes.","Everything I've ever wanted from an Animal Crossing game. This island is my own, through and through. Yes it is a shame there's only one island per console, but that does not take  this game from a 9 to a 1.","More of 7 1/2 than an 8...I've always loved the animal crossing series. But of course there are always some kind of problems. Its Nintendo, we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that $$$. We still give in and buy the games anyway. That being said here's some things I found wrong.1st, the one island per switch situation. We all know about it by now. We all dislike that decision. I'm not gonna go in on how dumb that is. Especially since I'm one of the lucky house holds with 2 switches. 2nd, you can't go on the mystery island tours with local or online players. One of my friends and I's favorite part of new leaf was going on the island tours together. Felt like this is taking a step backwards.3rd, we STILL can't kick out villagers once they moved in, just like new leaf you have to wait for the villager to make the suggestion to move, then say ok. Which sucks, cuz when nook gives you the task of placing the 3 houses for the new comers, you don't know who it will be until after you've finished making the furniture for said villagers. (Snooty jerks should start out in tents like the rest of us btw. But that's another topic all together). That is unless you had the nook miles to fly to 3 islands, happen to come across and convince 3 villagers you actually want to move into your island, b4 the task was given. Then and only then will you know who's moving in. Which feels like a slap in the face, since Nintendo advertised this game to let us pick and choose villagers 24/7.4th, not being able to relocate the plaza, airport, river openings and the mineable rocks. dont have to explain why this is flawed.5th, the museum dosent give you explanations on the bugs, fish or fossils once you found all the peices. In new leaf, once you donated something you can go in and read up a little info on what you found. Now you just look it up on your \"collections app\" or blathers can tell you about the bug/fish/fossils you find, if you have it in your inventory. Again felt like a step backwards.6th, took away the choice of what room to build. In new leaf you can choose what rooms to build in your home. My old house had only the back room, attic and basement done. I wanted to recreate that house. Only for nook to tell me that the back room was going to be made frist, then the side room...again step backwards.7th, not being able to put qr designs on all furniture items. Also some items not being customizable at all. Example, fence that I wish I could paint white, instead of buying the specific white version. Or wanting to put a custom color on the bed frame, not just the sheets.8th, no way to load your self made qr designs, from new leaf/happy home, to the switch. If you remembered to take a picture of every qr code for every design you made, congratulations! You can use the Nintendo app and download a non-editable version onto the switch...if you have Nintendo online. Locking, what was free in the last series, behind a paywall now is just shameful. People would have gotten Nintendo online for the ability to visit friends islands as it is. Which leads me to the final complaint.You know what really would have made people want to get Nintendo online for this game? CLOUD SAVES! They took away cloud saves to stop cheaters, yet people found a money glitch litterly on the release date!...But if you look past all these frustrations, the game is very relaxing and a fun time waster. A lot of these problems could be fixed with an update, so who knows what the future holds.","It is a very good and calm game. I love the graphics (finally in HD!). The bad thing is that you only have one island per switch and it doesn't have a split screen. It is a shame, but there is time to improve it. I think if you like quiet games or are a fan of the saga, this will be your favorite.","This game is excellent, I can't stop playing it, it's fun and has so many thing to do that I can spend hours and hours playing it and still don't get tired\rBest game that I have played in a while","\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f!) \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0447 20.03.2020 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u043c\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0437\u0430 3700\u20bd. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0438 10 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u042f\u0417\u042b\u041a!!!! \u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435. \u0418 \u044f \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0434 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443. \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0438 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e!)","While I totally agree that only allowing one island per Switch is a garbage move by Nintendo, everything else about this game is a 10/10.","This game is the culmination of all the previous versions in one. It's perfect a game and I can't think of the developers enough. Some people are complaining that there's no goals, when you're daily tasks and goals are rewarded with Nook Points to keep you motivated. The whole point to this game is to relax, enjoy and do whatever you want to a deserted island to make it feel like home to you. Craft furniture. Fly to other islands. Have mega 8 player party popper fests with a voice chat feature through your phone. Amazing. Are there some flaws? Yes, but every game does. People who are rating it zero don't know what their talking about. I highly recommend this game for it just being so pure and wholesome and just so enjoyable.","Honestly a lovely game. I understand frustrations with the island restrictions, but this game is still a 10/10 for me. It's not a game you win, just a game you play, which often is just what I need.If you need a relaxing, psuedo-life sim, this is your game.","This game is fantastic. What else can I say? It runs well on the Switch. The only issue that I have is that apparently the fishing tourney is timed to just 3 minutes. That sucks, but I think I can get over it : D","Epic. Absolutely epic. It's a slow burn to start the first few days can be overwhelming and waiting for things can be tough. But 100% worth the wait. The museum alone is a 10/10 it is so impressive. The silly puns are amazing and hilarious. The villagers are adorable. Tom Nook once again offering us 0% loans for new homes, cant beat it. Island hopping is a blast . i see 30 hours of gameplay in the base game, i can't wait to see the amazing DLC to come.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the kind of game that will continue to be playable for years after its release.  It is playable at any pace that is comfortable for its wide range of players.  I have personally spent the majority of the last 5 days playing it, and there is still so much to do.  Because of the franchise's famous real-time progression system, it maintains a fresh feel to it everyday.  It's the sort of game I envision myself playing 20 minutes a day for the next four years, not just grinding it all out in a month.  The vast new DIY workshop system and the customization customization system adds a whole new level to the ability for the game to be made your own.  The ability to terraform he island is also a very useful feature.  Overall, the game maintains a perfect balance of combining New Leaf, Pocket Camp, and Happy Home Designer into one game with the new and improved capabilities of the Switch.  The often talked about multiplayer aspect, though it does not affect me as of yet, seems to be a major drawback and is the only thing keeping this game from achieving a score of ten.  The Switch could easily have multiple islands per unit and the fact that one can't transfer their save data to another console is also a massive inconvenience.  Nintendo needs to realize its massive standing within the gaming industry.  If it is to continue to dominate and compete with the likes of Sony and Microsoft, it must adapt and allow these seemingly basic things to occur, rather than do obviously gouging their customers into buying entirely new Switch units if they wish to have multiple islands.","I really enjoy the game so far.My  coups de Coeur's are;\u2022The detailed graphics on the critters you catch and the villagers. (you can see fur...omg)\u2022 crafting and customizing mechanic \u2022 STORAGE \u2022 Flowers grow back\u2022 The museum. It's in every game but check it out room per room. Wow. I also have some things I don't necessarily like. Like how you can not access information on the critters you have already caught. You have to catch it again and ask Blathers about it. It gets a little annoying with bugs. I'm hoping I'm just not far enough in game and there's going to be an encyclopedia app on the nook phone.Also  sometimes I get caught on a barrier around houses and trees and it looks like I'm stuck moonwalking for some reason. A lot of people don't like that you can only have one islands per switch but I don't personally mind. I created new accounts so I could do a themed island based on the Odyssey. When Odysseus was on the goddess witch Circle's island. I understand that if your playing with siblings and you don't want then to mess up your island or vice versa it can get annoying. I hope that maybe for those of you who have issues they will release an update that allows you to choose on your profile if you wish to join the residents of an existing island or forge your way on your own island.None of the issues I faced were gamebraking and I still really enjoy the game as a whole. I'd recommend it.","Great game and the issue people have with multiplayer is ridiculous. There are so many reasons why that is the case to share an island. Also it's not that big of a deal to share. The whole point of the game is to have fun and people are taking it too seriously. Enjoy it for what it is, a game and don't get hung up on the fact that you need to actually play it to get the resources you want","Un juego excelente, con detalles muy cuidados. Su mundo es muy intensivo y se han mejorado los fallos de su anterior entrega. El mejor Animal crossing de la saga.","Games implemented new features and great ways to prevent other from cheating and ruining the in game trade currency. Honestly a huge step up from New Leaf. It\u2019s what City Folk should have been. The long wait was worth it and they\u2019ve kept their fans happy. Don\u2019t listen to the other reviews, it\u2019s just Sony fans complaining because they don\u2019t own a switch and don\u2019t have anything even close to this for their console.","Stunning. Stress relieving. Unbelievably charming and joyful. The ability to curate your island and enjoy the slow passing of time rather than the constant pressure to build, buy, and discover things on an objective storyline other games work with is exceptionally refreshing. Not to mention, the game is CUTE. The puns, the blathering of animal creatures in place of speech, the adorable poses your character makes when changing outfits.It is the nonlinear game all can enjoy, if you only look past it's simple setup. If you want complexity, seek elsewhere. This is purely for the young at heart and those than want to escape reality with their friends, or on their own.","Was going to give it a 9 mainly due to the equipment durability issue however, I changed it to a 10 to try and balance out the unnecessary zeroes it is receiving. Yeah I can see how people are upset that they cannot have more than one island due to having multiple families but the review should be based on how the game looks and plays. On that note the game plays great, better experience and creativity than ever before. HD graphics suit well for the game, and adding in simple features such as being able to place outdoor objects or river hopping makes the experience much more enjoyable. As stated before my only issue is that the equipment breaks and I really do not want to have to carry around more than one shovel, fishing rod, etc. Overall great game, highly recommend.","this game is absolutely fantastic, the crafting system and freedom of layout design really helps differentiate this game from the previous instalments in the franchise, while still feeling like the traditional animal crossing games. The only negative i have with this game is the lack of multiple saves per switch, however i do not feel this a negative enough point to ruin the entire game, i personally do not share a switch with anyone, but this game is absolutely brilliant and i highly recommend.","Me parece un juego bastante relagente y bueno la verdad adem\u00e1s de que jugarlo con amigos es divertido pero por lo que veo hay mucha gente con cuentas falsas que odian a Nintendo se les tendr\u00eda que caer la cara de verg\u00fcenza hacer lo que hacen no veo normal que una persona que no a probado el juego tenga derecho a votar deber\u00edan solamente dejar votar a las personas que tengan el juego escaneando el usuario de la consola en la p\u00e1gina web","Really, an amazing game! This is my first Animal Crossing game and I am enjoying it so much! The one island per console thing is a bit of a bummer but I guess that's just how Animal Crossing always has been. Loving the cute and colorful graphics! The sound design is great, as well. It feels like you are really on a deserted island getaway. Overall, great game! Must-buy!","I'm so happy to be returning to the world of Animal Crossing. All our old friends from previous games appear to be on the island with us, along with some new characters. The online multiplayer functionality is better than it's ever been, and I like the addition of a crafting system. Of course, with new technology, New Horizons is the most beautifully rendered game in the Animal Crossing series so far. I'm especially impressed with the lighting and the \"fuzzy\" detail on many of the animal neighbors. New Horizons also introduces a new character creation mechanic. No more frantically searching for the \"right\" answers to questions from Bob or K.K. Slider to create a character that looks how you want - now you can just choose from a wider variety of skin tones, eye shapes, and hair styles and colors.\r Of course it's disappointing that there can't be multiple \"islands\" on the same device or game card. However, this isn't new: only one player per game card could be the \"mayor\" of the town in New Leaf, leaving the other player unable to make changes to the town. Other than wishing more than one person could have an island on the same save file, New Horizons is everything I wanted from a new Animal Crossing game and more.","The game is fantastic! All these people review bombing with scores of 0-1 because of the one Island per system is just silly. Sure it's not entirely convenient, but it's absolutely not game breaking at all. Stop review bombing games children!!","Es un juego incre\u00edble, es una lastima que la gente que no conoce la saga critique el juego debido a que no es el tipico juego clich\u00e9, si eres alguien que le gusta jugar un juego de forma tranquila y que te rinda, adem\u00e1s de una experiencia muy diferente a otros juegos, este es tu juego, si buscas algo mas de acci\u00f3n prueba otro.","I've been a huge fan of the Animal Crossing franchise ever since the original on the Gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non-stop, I think I can say that it's definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt.  The game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your island down to the ground and water beneath your feet.  Never before have I felt so free in an Animal Crossing game.\r For how much I love the game, there are of course some downsides that many other users also are reporting.  The biggest of which that everyone and their dog is talking about is the 1-island-per-switch thing.  Now to be fair, this isn't unusual for the franchise, it has almost always been a 1 town per console game ever since the original on the Gamecube,  other than my sister who plays this game on occasion, I'm the only one playing so I'm not really affected too much.  Normally I would forgive this though since it's nothing new, I would forgive it if it weren't for the other issue that everyone is talking about being the limited Co-op.  This is a relatively new issue that started in New Leaf, where being the second player sucked because all the cool things that allowed you to customize and play to your heart's content was exclusive to the first player, so it made being anything other than the first player essentially boring and pointless.  I would've expected Nintendo to be smarter this time around and remove that pesky quirk, there's no reason you can't have more than one mayor or an assistant mayor/Island representative that is capable of doing everything that the first player can do except maybe delete the island, but I guess that didn't cross their minds for whatever reason?  Again like I said, I basically am the only one who plays this game so I'm not really blowing a fuse over this but for anyone with siblings or loved ones who also play this game a lot, I can see how it's so frustrating.  In this situation, the problem is not so much that Nintendo is \"Behind the times\" (they are but still) the problem is more like Nintendo taking 3 steps back when it comes to Co-Op this time around.\r Other than that, I think the positives still out-weight the negatives by a longshot.  The freedom to customize and change almost everything about your island is a huge positive.  All of the new additions are certainly welcome and the amount of quality of life changes regarding the menuing, the inventory system, the ABD and shopping, etc. make me wonder why I put up with the problems in New Leaf for so long.  The graphics are pure eye-candy, places like the museum are simply beautiful on the Switch to look at.  Playing with friends online is also a pleasant experience, although I do wish it was possible to play on other people's islands outside of your friends list for anyone who allowed that option.  Overall, it's a pretty great game for anyone who's new to the series despite its flaws, it is a must-have for anyone with a Switch IMO","By far, this is the most inventive version of animal crossing. As someone who's been playing since 2002, and by proxy grew up with this franchise, I love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason. There are problems, but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be. DIY being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands, so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible. Certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it, but that's nothing a little time travel can't fix. Time travel, though I personally don't like it, circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise's progression works, and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible, animal crossing has only ever worked when there's something important to do. When you complete everything, what else is there? So, if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from, it'd be a 9/10. Only having one island per switch is annoying, yeah, but at the same time, is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like Sonic the hedgehog (2006), or crappy movie based games like shark tales? At worst this game is a 5/10, at best it's an 8/10. Clearly, Nintendo should've made islands pertain to the profiles and not the system, but this game is such a perfect sequel to the previous games. New horizons was made for a certain kind of experience, a one player experience, in which you could do almost anything yourself. I haven't shared a system in years as these games and systems became more personalized and tailored to this kind of experience, which puts my score into perspective, but that doesn't mean I excuse it's flaws. I certainly feel for those who can't afford a second console and I want better for those who are stuck in that shared purgatory, but video games in general have come to a point where everyone has to have their own system, something that was very prevalent with handheld systems like the DS that only ever allowed one profile. Wireless connectivity has taken over and it's no longer the days where you would simply have your own memory card and put it into slot B, then plug in your second controller. So few games do this anymore where you can just grab a second controller and play split screen or do anything of the sort. I can't say whether it's good or bad that games are like this now, but for my personal experience with this game, I give an 8/10.","Amazing game that is just too close to perfection.\r There are not a lot of negatives, so let's start with them.\r First off, you already know where this is going. If you didn't start the island, if you want to contribute to the island, you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader. That kind of sucks. I don't have a problem with it as I play with my family, but I'd imagine siblings having issues with this. Do keep this in mind before buying if this is important.\r The other issue I have with this game is the first week or so. It's sloooow. Even for an animal crossing game. It was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points. If you pick up the game, stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built. It does pick up from there.\r As far as negatives go, that's all I got. Now here are a few things I love about the game.\r First of all, the game has a ton to do. From decorating your island to designing shirts, hats, and dresses, you'll never run out of things to do. That, along with unlockable features and buildings all along the way, you'll find yourself popping in every day, and getting sucked into it and next thing you know it's dinner time.\r Also, the online exists. Its like new leaf's online. Not great, but eh, it works.\r All in all, I'd 100% reccomend picking up the game. Ignore the butthurt review bombers who read an article on Kokatu and suddenly hate the game over something that hardly applies to them. If Nintendo fixed the way the island sharing works to allow non-leader residents to contribute more, this game would break the review scale.","This game is just addicting, it\u2019s hard to put down when you start, it may be one town per console, but it\u2019s been like that since the GameCube version, this game deserves way more credit, graphics are amazing, crafting is fun, etc","It's undoubtedly the most stunningly beautiful game in the series, drawing you in from the first second you play and offering a perfect getaway during these trying times. Everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry, even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies (such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store the clothes) - but those are few and far between.\rThe atmosphere is simply soothing, causing you to linger and stay for longer than anticipated even if you just quickly want to get some chores done.\r Unfortunately, the way online / multiplayer features are handled feels lacking and old-fashioned, but that's what we've come to expect from Nintendo by now - always 10 years behind the latest tech. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the island quickly becomes a very personal space that is best enjoyed alone, with only some irregular visits from others - so I don't put much weight on the online features.\r Also addressing the critisisms being voiced in the review-bombs at the moment:\rThe one island per console limit has been known for a long time ahead of this release and people acting surprized and entitled just didn't do their research. Also goes to show how playing together on one island is really not the main aspect of the game, making the bad multiplayer features I mentioned even less significant.\rHaving to share one island per console is nothing new for the series, the 3DS had it too. It used to be more easily possible to bypass it as it technically possible to have one island per memory card / game cartridge.","A great game worth playing if you have the slightest interest that succeeds at everything it wants to do, but this isn't for everyone so you may not enjoy it if this type of game isn't for you. My only complaint is the limiting of one island per switch which is really bad as it causes conflicting creative ideas and competing for resources, so if you share a switch with others who want to play this game, then that's a big issue, and I can't fully judge how big of a deal this is","Probably the best game of the year and the best switch title so far. The negative reviews are obviously jealous haters who can't accept that the Animal Crossing franchise keeps giving high quality games and get even more successful. I can grant that I will be playing this game for a long time!","I like alot of the new additions to the game such as ladders, pole vault, etc. But the way they treat (Player 2) is horrible and not haveing a cloud save save file is a major step in the wrong direction. Not to mention haveing to pay a subscription to play online. But its still a good game, i just hope they can fix it later on","This game has been great so far. I think the multiplayer and all the island hopping is super fun. I\u2019ve spent so many hours already looking for rare fish and bugs. Honestly once you start playing you can\u2019t really stop. I can\u2019t wait to see my museum all filled.","I love this game, I've had a blast playing since I got it on release. Every minute is enjoyable, from running around collecting fruit to helping your neighbors when they're sick. The game looks excellent, having cute characters while the water effects, shadows, etc. look incredible.  The only thing that keeps it away from being a 10/10 is the fact that froggy chair isn't in the game, but other than that, it's fantastic.","It's perfect to put my mind at ease during these tough times. Besides, I bought it for my boyfriend as well (he has never seen the appeal to it) and he loves it now","This is a wonderful game. Not only does it allow the player more freedom than ever, the ability to customize your island to the full extent is so enjoyable and keeps you playing for hours each day. While time skipping is an option, it simply takes the fun out of it and it is more enjoyable to experience the game day by day and see your hard work come to fruition in the passing time. My only complaint is the lack of cloud saves, and contrary to popular belief, the lack of multiple islands doesn\u2019t bother me, because the mechanic that hinders player twos progress was in New Leaf too, so it is simply a lack of further development and not a step back.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is my new favorite video game of all time. I did play both the gcn game and Wild World on the DS but I was very little at the time. I got super into the series with New Leaf. And this game takes everything good about that game and amps it up to 100!People were complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per console, but honestly I don\u2019t care. Me sharing the island with my sister actually made us become closer. I also haven\u2019t used any online features yet because I don\u2019t have any friends with the game.Single player is where the game truest shines. With adorable characters and gameplay that makes chores fun. I can\u2019t not recommend this people who enjoy just sitting back and relaxing. This game isn\u2019t meant for people who like constant action as your meant to sit back, relax and enjoy the little things","The best Animal Crossing has ever been. It's truly a massive upgrade from the past entries in the series, and adds a whole lot of new content. It may have a slow start, but eventually it picks up and shows where it really shines.\r I understand the issue that the people who are Review-Bombing this game have, which is that you can only have one save game per system. Personally, I play this alone so i'm fine with it. Animal Crossing has never been a multiplayer experience, anyway. Sure, it's had online multiplayer in the older entries, but the game is mainly single player. It's also never been possible to have more then one town without buying new cartridges before, so i don't see the issue.","More fun than I had anticipated. Haven't played an Animal Crossing since the GC and DS. I appreciate all the changes they've made to allow to a better flowing game.Yeah, multiplayer could be better but multiplayer isn't why I love Animal Crossing.If you're a fan of the series, I highly recommend it.","This game is incredible. I have played the series since the original Gamecube version. I highly recommend this game for anyone and everyone.","An amazing game that has been well worth the wait. I feel this is the height of the Animal Crossing series thus far. The island development is a nice change of pace in the series, and each new step in the progress is rewarding and exciting to complete. Watching a completely deserted island turn into a bustling community of cute critters is addicting and I can't think of a better time for this game than now.","Amazing game! New Horizons perfectly embodies the  Animal Crossing franchise!","A relaxing game with a lot of stuff to do. Would never getting bored of this game.","This game is truly fantastic. The only reason I can't feel okay with giving it a 10/10 is because of a lack of a mass craft feature. Turning 30 clams into fish bait 1 by one can be very tedious, so if they made an update that allowed you to craft multiple at one time, it would be a perfect game and easily a contender for goty.","This game is simply amazing. This game is amazingly cozy and feels really at home on the switch. It's a game that can be played for eternity. The multiplayer is a little laggy sometimes while playing online but since you can control exactly what other players are allowed to do. Local multiplayer is really boring but that doesn't really effect my experience with this game at all. Anyone who gives this game below a 7 have no idea what they are talking about. This game is a replayable masterpiece.","A slow burn as it usually is with animal crossing and a bit grindy but once in the swing of things its non stop! Fully enjoying the freedom that this game gives!!","The best game in the series yet, all the new mechanics are a breath of fresh air for the series.","I feel like a vast majority of the bad reviews are talking about the bad multiplayer, but none of them are talking about the actual game. I love this game, and honestly think that this is the most casual and relaxing experience I have ever had in a form of media. From the music, to the gameplay, to the amazing visuals, this game is a masterpiece. 10/10","Jouer \u00e0 ce jeux est comme avec les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents opus toujours un r\u00e9el bonheur","I know that lots of people have been review bombing New Horizons due to the one island per Switch feature. I'm the only player on my island, so it doesn't affect me.\rI just love the game and, whilst it is lacking in a few features at the moment (cafe, art gallery etc.), it has been all but confirmed that some of these features will be added into the game via free (probably) updates. Once these updates release, the game will be a perfect 10 for me, but for now, it must stay at a 9","This is my first animal crossing game, and I have a lot of fun playing it. But there is always something, this game lacks a lot of quality of life features. Basically the game does not care about a player's time and just wastes it. The more I catch bugs of fishes the more I'm getting sick of doing that. Catching bugs is not that bad, but still, I don't want to see the same text every time and catching fishes is even more tiring.  I don't really share my console with different people but it shouldn't be solved like it is now.  I really hope that this will be fixed in future updates. If not I think that a lot of players will abandon this game really fast.","An amazing game. It adds so much from the it previous games from its series. There is so much to do in the game and it make me coming back every single day","Excellent game. Already have 200+ hours in. All these negative reviews are a result of childlike behavior, whereas people complain and whine and make a big deal if they find one small thing they dislike. The game is amazing, hands down, been having lots of fun with all of my friends. Anyone saying they couldn\u2019t figure out what to do or complaining that there\u2019s no plot to push them forward, has no idea what animal crossing is or how to play it.","Unfortunately, Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game that rode on the back of serious anticipation, and a complete dry spell of games for the Nintendo Switch. Having spent over 60 hours in the game, I finally had to take a step back and ask myself \u201cwhat is it all for\u201d? Great for creativity, but lacking in anything meaningful or providing longevity, this game is a hard one to recommend over cheaper, better alternatives.","I think 1 island 1 Switch is amazing game design. Something I heard from a Japanese friend (seems true but need to double check) is that one of the creators would always get home from work late. Probably because of Japan\u2019s insane working hours. Anyways, their kids would be asleep, and they wish they could game with them. So they thought, what if there was a game where they could game together, even if not at the same time? And I think that is the inspiration for the shared island game design. Even when one isn\u2019t playing, you can see traces of their play session or they can leave nice messages, etc.The game is literally called \u201cAnimal Forest: Come Together\u201d in Japanese. It\u2019s about working and building an island together. Isolating each Switch user on a desert island goes against that principle, of course that isn\u2019t a feature. People that accuse Nintendo of making a cash grab are missing the point entirely. They are the type that like to characterize companies as big, money grabbing entities. Without thinking maybe, just maybe, these talented developers might have made those design decisions for other reasons. It seems to me many western gamers feel entitled and want every feature exactly how they want it.People be so angry and review bombing left and right. A single design feature they don\u2019t like doesn\u2019t warrant rating this gem a 0. Did you not read about 1 island 1 Switch before buying the game?Anyways, amazing game. Fun, beautiful, polished, engaging 10/10. Switch must play.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautiful game. Players are swept off to a blissful, peaceful island where they are free to explore, expand, and evolve the land. Characters in the game feel like they're right by your side, assisting you as the island grows and flourishes. From the moment you step off the plane and begin your Nook Inc. Getaway Package, the stunning art style, music, sound design and environments craft a game you'll never want to put down. As the game advances with the real-world clock, every day brings an abundance of new things to experience. It gives players something to look forward to, and the villagers of your island really start to feel like friends. Experience diverse seasons that bring a variety of fish, bugs and fossils to collect and fill a breathtaking museum with. Furnish and customize your home exactly the way you want. Shape the island into your own \"happy place.\" The feeling of joy and childlike wonder this game evokes makes this game a must-have. However, the flaws with this game shouldn't be overlooked. Every Switch is interconnected to an island, meaning there can be only one island per system. While in theory this allows for people to join together in creating an amazing shared island, giving only the first player the power to really advance is a huge misstep. It makes the other players feel more like visitors that equal players. That being said, everyone is still able to create their own stories, homes, and connection to the game. it's not enough to darken the overall experience. All in all, this is the brightest and most innovative the Animal Crossing series has ever been. This is a game that thrives on moments, big and small. It manages to make the time-consuming and monumental parts of the game feel earned and worth the effort. At the same time, the lovely presentation and addictive gameplay allow the little moments to feel just as meaningful. It's a game that'll turn any grey day into a sunny one. Take a deep breath, get comfy, and let Animal Crossing: New Horizons blow you away.","A realy good game that I like. I can use tons of creativity and enjoy people actually created things like the map of the legend of zelda a link to past and melemele island from pokemon sun and moon and pokemon ultra sun and moon","They should remove those ratings of \"0\" we all know that they are not users who have the video game or are simply trolls surely from sony.","Que os jodan piperos.es un juegazo.

Yes, it is a downside, but that doesn't mean it's instantly a 0/10, it's still a lot of fun, and there's infinite fun to be had, as you'd expect with an animal crossing game.","This game is an amazing addition to the series. It makes me sad to see such a low user rating!! As far as I know, animal crossing has always had a \"main\" player and secondary players, which did not have the same perks as the main player.

Are you serious?? So I need to pay USD59 for another account just for another island?  This is a con job!","Nintendo is pulling an all out cash grab on this game. Yes the gameplay, graphics, and overall feel are great....but they lock one island per switch. Not only is it one island per switch but any secondary players do no get the full experience that is offered to the island creator. The primary character is the only one who can take direction from Tom nook and further the development of the island. They cant even contribute supplies to help build things. The secondary player basixally gets a lite version of the game. This is  absolute   **** Imagine if other games did this forcing you to have seperate consoles and copies of the game. I knew Nintendo was **** stingy and grubby with money but this is the worst yet.","Game gets boring very quickly. Same as every other game, you complete chores to earn money and increase the size of your house. The crafting system is interesting in the beginning, but gets stale very quickly and can't be used for anything actually important, like infrastructure.\rAdditionally, the \"island\" from the last game which was a good place to make some quick money, was removed and replaced with randomly generated islands that are usually devoid of anything interesting. Ok if you're stuck in the apocalyptic COVID-19 quarantine nightmare... but there are more fun ways to spend your time. Also, I can't believe there isn't a voice chat on the switch, it's so annoying to have to type things to your friends with a ~20 character limit.","the only reason why i gave this mark was because i couldn't even play the game due to Nintendo's mysterious choice of giving the possibility to create only one island for console, thanks to that i can only hope that they will eventually fix this huge problem as soon as possible, if not this is the mark the game deserve as it is simply unacceptable in 2020.\rBut what really blows my mind are all the positive reviews from critics not even mentioning neither addressing this issue at all.\rThis was my first Animal crossing ever and my worst experience in my whole life as a gamer.","terrible experience\r UI/UX make like in games from late 90.\rMultiplayer experience its a sad joke.\r Enjoy your time well spend on loading screen","This game is EMPTY and only allows one island per console, these are my issues with it.\r Animal Crossing: New Horizons's release date was pushed back 9 months, but a lot of fans said they would prefer the game to be pushed back more than releasing the game incomplete.

Do you want to stare at a loading screen for 20 minutes for every 3 minutes of play? Do you want a nonsensical chat interface that requires you to use your cellphone? That's ACNH online.\r Why in the world does every player need to exit out of all menus and interactivity every time a new player joins or leaves?  Seriously, this actually happens. You will be prompted to close whatever menu or window you are in so that you can wait for the game to autosave and then display a loading screen that can take as many as five minutes to load.\r Why does the game crash if a player gets sick of this garbage and leaves without using the airport?\r Why is it impossible to join a game on an island if even a single player on that island is active with a task?\r Why are second players treated like second class citizens? Different profiles on the same switch should have the option to play on their own island.\r Games have been offering seamless online experiences for YEARS. What a huge failure on the part of Nintendo. You're seriously telling me you couldn't get someone from Rockstar for GTA, any Counterstrike clone, any fighting game, or WOW to help you build this? Shame on you Nintendo. This is an awful letdown for what could have been an all time great game.\r Online play is unplayable. Even more inexcusable since Nintendo charges for the privilege of watching that f****** loading screen for hours.\r The online experience needs to be completely rebuilt and patched before anything else.  Second is something to address the fact that second profiles on the same Switch are powerless to do anything in game. A very distant third would be addressing the clunky crafting system.\r Fix the netplay. Please. Its so bad.

It honestly feels like you're nothing more than an NPC on another player's island.I honestly didn't mind sharing the island, but the current gameplay design means I really have no incentive to do so, as the 2nd player I can make no real decisions and I have no story. Please fix this Nintendo!","This game is very boring.

With a bigger, better console they pushed out half -if that- of a game. They stripped a lot of features. They added a couple of features. It just doesn't have much to do. There is no real incentive to play multiplayer.  There's just not much in general. I regret paying full price. It's a half price game.","You stole my money. You didn't advise that this game was only for 1 player. Nintendo Switch is a family console, so it's so annoying that there is no way to play more than 1 person. The other players are just spectators that cant evolve while the main player is the only one that can make progress in the game. If this is a way to make people buying more switches, YOU ARE **** ROBBERS","This game doesn\u2019t allow multiple save files. The switch is not a handheld device. That is what the DS line is for. It is a console. Spending 300$ on a DS is absurd. So to say I need a second switch to have my own file is also absurd. Big swing and a miss (and easily fixed) Nintendo!","Biggest f* up of 2020, Nintendo!The fact that only one island can exist per console (not per account) is a deal breaker. Our Switch is shared between my sister and I, and this single element ruined the whole game. I don't understand how the producers  even thought this would be a good idea!Thanks for ruining what could have been game of the year.","For the most part this game is really good but if you have one switch console in your house and have multiple people who want to play this game then it sucks for anyone who isn't the first player.\rThis is my first animal crossing game.\rNintendo marketed the switch as a home console for families to share. so why would they make such a kid friendly game so restrictive to the other players?\rBiggest **** up of 2020.","If I spend 60\u20ac\u00a0on a new game, I expect to be fully able to play it in its fully features. It's unacceptable that you can't create more than one island per switch. It's like Fifa asking you a new Xbox only to start a new career. It should be clearly stated that this game is for only one player and any additional player to enjoy a full experience should get a new console. That said I'm really glad I got a refund and I'll consider give this game another chance if, and only if an update comes out fix this mess.","So disappointed with this game, starts off good with plenty to do... until you realise that any other players on the same console have absolutely nothing to do, was looking forward to playing with the whole family but now we've all totally lost interest,  update soon Nintendo and only then will I change  my rating.\u2639","I really enjoy the game but the decision to make player two practically useless was a big mistake. I hope nintendo makes an update so each profile can have different islands","Originally this game scored close to a 10/10 for me. Due to the poor design choices for multiplayer, I am  3 weeks into this game and unable to expand my island or complete any of the main goals of the game.  The first player to play the game is the only player who has any control and the only player who can ultimately play the game to its fullest. I was the second person to start the game in my house, and I am the only one currently playing it. However, there is no ability to delete users or switch who the main resident is. This game lacks the proper communication to users before playing - had I known this was the way the game worked, my boyfriend would not have started playing first. Now, I must either completely start over and lose all of my progress and hard work I have put into this game, or I must log on to his account and play both of our accounts to ensure I can actually complete goals and expand. I am actually quite surprised with how overlooked this design was by Nintendo - extremely disappointing.","Something i\u2019ve never seen in any game before. Only 1 player is allowed to fully play this game per console. Congratulations on the most idiotic element i\u2019ve ever seen in any video game.","To start, this game is incredibly fun at its base. But there are some truly asinine decisions made by Nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game. They don\u2019t deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions. The good: this game is, as far as straight gameplay goes, truly wonderful. It\u2019s everything Animal Crossing was meant to be and it retains the heart of the series. While it\u2019s missing quite a few of the features previous games had, updates look to be coming regularly to bring it up to par (looking at you Redd and Lief from the recent update). It\u2019s charming, has lasting appeal, and has enough to do that even past the first few weeks you\u2019ll want to pick it up every day. The eh: people with odd hours may want to set their time zone to a more traditional time before playing. I tend to be up at odd hours due to my job and on a lot of days that means I\u2019m not allowed to sell items at full price, sell turnips, buy clothes, talk to most of my neighbors, or catch certain fish/bugs. Time travel still works in this game but turnips will spoil if you do. The nature of the game dictates that you have things tied to time but give nighttime players more to do! If I happen to be only able to play at 1 am one night I should be relegated to only resident services and the museum, with the occasional visit from Whisp.The bad: if you want to play this game with anybody other than yourself, you\u2019re looking at the most tedious and unnecessary multiplayer system known to man. A long animation is required for each player visiting your item. It requires you to exit all menus and failure to do so means the visitor can\u2019t come. If more than one person try to visit at the same time, at least one will get an error and have to keep trying. It makes visiting with friends incredibly difficult. If you want to have anybody else in your household play the game look forward to buying more Switches because the only option is to share your island. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad EXCEPT only one person gets the full experience. My mom wanted to play so she got her own tent on my island. Since I\u2019ve been playing for weeks though, she gets zero build up, far fewer nook miles, ZERO instruction past a handful of things, and she needs me for a lot of major island additions like houses. Why can\u2019t it be an option to create a separate save file for each person? I\u2019m guessing that good old fashioned Nintendo greed has to do with it. It\u2019s not enough to pay up to $300 for a console and another $60 for a game I\u2019d bet will never see a sale, if you want to have the full experience for everybody in your house on a so called family console, you\u2019ll need to shell out at minimum $260 for a switch lite and another copy of AC to give just one more person. Also, speaking of my mother, I went to visit her for a week and went to change my time zone to hers so we could get the standard experience. That means that all 800,000 bells worth of turnips that I had spoiled. I live in Eastern time and she lives in Central. ANY time travel backward means your turnips spoil. Look I get it, time travelers don\u2019t get to game the turnip market. But I\u2019m not manually setting my time here, just updating a time zone to reflect where I\u2019m at physically. But that makes me a dirty cheater apparently and I\u2019m being punished as such. What else could possibly be wrong here you ask? How about zero cloud save support despite the promise it\u2019d be added \u2018shortly\u2019 after launch. How about no bulk crafting for items you\u2019ll definitely need in bulk. How about the first major event completely ruining some of the best part of the game by turning everything into eggs? This game could\u2019ve been perfect. And I know some of those gripes may not mean much to some, but it\u2019s a serious disappointment to me coming back to the series for the first time in a long time to see it turned into a frustrating version of perfection.  I have zero hope nintendo will do the right thing and fix most of these issues. This is why I tend to stay away from Nintendo. Every time I give them another shot they take my money and give me half a product. Shame on them, but shame on me too for trusting them. And for playing this game still. Despite everything it\u2019s still too fun to put down, even if I am incredibly frustrated. That\u2019s why it gets a 4 and not a 0, but there should be a warning on every box about all the ways Nintendo will force you to have fun on their terms and not your own.","Everyone in my family chipped in to buy this game but now in turns out that only one of us can really play it.","Cant create more than 1 island. This destroys the replayability of the game. It also prevents more than 1 user on each switch from experience the game in the best way possible.\r Art, Dialogue, music and are nice however its all wasted effort when you look at the end result of the 1 island per console rule.","All the positive ratings are people who dont have anyone else playing the game on their switch!!!! (Practically) Ok so I'm new to the animal crossing franchise so I dont mind the whole 1 island per console setup. It's the \"first player to start the game and name the island is the only one who gets to actually do something\" problem. I've played hundreds of games and I've never had this with any other. As I said before I like the idea of sharing an island, just not the fact that as I'm the second user on the console to play the game all I get to do are the side tasks and just collect fauna and customise a house. If there was no way around having more than one player doing the main game tasks like choosing where to set up tents and then other things I wont mention for spoilers sake, then they shouldn't of had the one island concept. It's just disappointing and frustrating how I cant even take part in advancing the island as a whole.Co-op is also pointless, you get to pick up items and shake trees, that's it. Another game first for me where the second player does absolutely nothing. My only hope is that they'll bring out an update that gives every player their own island so they get to experience the WHOLE game. But this is highly doubtful. :(","What's the point of a 2nd player if they can't really contribute to building anything in the town. Game is exactly what animal crossing is supposed to be I suppose but it gets pretty boring and repetitive, ESPECIALLY for anyone not the island representative, and for the rep since no one can actually help you build the town. BOO[!!! Shame on Nintendo until they make a patch for this","How can Nintendo make a game, that has less content than the previous ones? Less characters , less resident dialogues, less fruit trees, less shops/buildings..........\rBut it is fun to play but it needs many content updates to become a good game","No family should have to buy multiple switches just for individuals to enjoy their own island and experience the full game. Charge for multiple game copies, that is fine that is what AC has always done (save for memory cards on GameCube, the closest equivalent). But entire consoles? That is a shameful money grab.","I have no issue when the developer decided to do this to protect their product of being abused but when I look at the price tag of USD60 per copy I seriously think that they are trying to rip us off.  I have 3 kids and I have to buy 3 copies of the game and 3 nintendo switches for them to play this game might as well I ask them to stick back to minecraft.","Only 1 island per Switch console, not account, even if the game is purchased multiple times. Only 1 Island ambassador can make major decisions about the island... per Switch console, not account. This leaves all other accounts on the console playing this game unable to progress the story. I hope Nintendo does something to fix this. Worst couch co-OP gameplay ever. It makes me sad that what would be a great game is hobbled by this poor choice in game design.","The game is great  except for 1 thing. Yo can\u2019t have multiple islands per switch, me and my sister bought the game thinking we would be able to build our seperate islands individual paradise. but no, you cant even have 2 islands, and the worst part, as the second player you can berely contribute to the progress of the game, you fell like an npc more than a player. All  im asking is to have at least 2 islands per switch, or to be able to have more than 1 town organizer.","I spent 10+ hours on the game but didn't even understand I couldn't unlock the museum or other features because my friend started the game first. I can't switch the primary resident, I can't progress in the game, and I'm very close to stop playing this game entirely.\r 1 primary resident PER SWITCH makes this game a 2. If you're 1 person playing on your Switch, great this is a good game, if anyone else ever cares to try the game and create their own player, this game is A ZERO for multiplayer. Do not even bother, the results are infuriating.","I do not know anything about this game. Bought it because everyone seems to love it and I really liked it so far. Told my Mom to try because I knew she'll love it but to my surprised, we share ONE island. What make it worse is that she won't be having the same experience cuz things u can do with her character is limited.. What kind of anti consumer **** is this.. You expect us to buy another switch? I would understand if this was because of hardware limitation.. But I doubt that. Its 2020 NINTENDO!!","Great game with good pace, cute npc's, and gameplay that is relatively intuitive.  This was my first animal crossing game and I got it to have a game to unwind.  I was absolutely stunned to find out the 1 save per console setup.  I have 3 young daughters and this has caused massive issues within the household.  Nintendo, this is no longer a handheld only franchise fix this asap please or I will start sending the daily recordings of the fighting and bickering between my kids for you to endure as I do..","Such a shame that this game only allows one person to create and name an island and any other player that joins in is playing on that same island with the same resources available that have been created by the originator (a bummer when the original creator has already used the items available that day). This is a family-friendly game yet it's basically a one player game per console....so we'd have to buy another console for someone else to play and create their own island. :-/ Fix this Nintendo!!","The fact that only one person can truly experience the game in it's entirety is rediculous. It seems like a money grab from Nintendo to try and sell more consoles and that just isn't right.","A good game with some critical flaws:\rTHE GOOD: Animal Crossings: New Horizons builds on everything from the previous entries in the series, the ability to visit friend's islands is fun, the gameplay almost always has something to do, and the vast array of NPC characters is exciting.\rTHE BAD: The online play is extremely clunky, disconnects randomly, pauses for lengthy periods when someone else joins an island (like a really long time), and is very difficult to get connected with friends. The local multiplayer is even worse, only the first player on the island can experience the full game, players who join afterward are extremely limited in what they can do.\rTHE UGLY: Playing together locally is even worse, with players joining the main player basically being limited to picking up items and being dragged around the island. The game is also limited to only one island per console with no ability to backup or transfer your island to another console. This means if your switch is lost, stolen or broken you have to completely start over, this is completely unacceptable in 2020, not sure how Nintendo launched a flagship title without the ability for cloud saves or console transfers.\rFINAL VERDICT: The game is fun and offers a lot to do, but there are some massive drawbacks that make it hard to recommend currently, do yourself a favor and wait for Nintendo to correct some of these glaring faults.","The game is great. But the fact that you can only have one island per switch is complete nonsense. Very, very poor move and the reason I\u2019m writing this review.","SO MUCH POTENTIAL....for 1 person. Do not get this game if you share. Me and my wife got it, she is the island rep and barely plays so I have to account hop to progress the island. Fix your game Nintendo. Either allow multiple people to be island reps, or add separate islands for each profile.","Looks like a lot of fun,  looks like even though I own the game I can barley play it because of the dumb player 2 restrictions. If you do not share a switch get it.","The game itself contains a lot of fun. However, there are plenty of conflicts in this game. First, it encourages players to play with their friends. But the experience of visiting friends is just like UPS: slow, complicated operations, and unstable connections. When you disconnect with your friend, all of you will lose your progress. When you try to reconnect, the long, nagging conversation will drive you mad over and over again. Second, the game is set to be one island per console. But if you lost your switch, or broke it by accident, well, congratulations, you would lose all the time you waste on this game. This is hilarious. Also the local multi-player experience is just like sharing the toilet with your partners. It could happen, but we all wish that it should never happen. So be it.","Pretty fun game. I would give it a 10/10. However, as much as I'm enjoying this game, not being able to play on the same console with someone else and have their own game is unacceptable. If every profile can't play the game normally, they shouldn't charge a \"normal\" price for it. Having only one island to me at least lowers the value to like a $35 game tops, not a $60. The other big problem I have is how tedious they have made simple things. Why do I have to restart every conversation if I either change my mind or want something different. It would not be a problem if there was a way to make all of the text appear on the screen at once. It takes almost a whole minute of Orville rambling just to type in a dodo code, and if you mess up, that island's full, etc, you have to wait through another 30 seconds of dialogue just to leave, and if you want to use a different code, you must sit through that minute convo again.  For a game that almost requires visiting people either locally or online (can't get all fruits otherwise) that is stupid. You want 3 of the color variants of one piece of clothing? well, too bad. You have to go in and out of the dressing room because you can't buy more than one outfit at a time. Also, Home storage should be considered when crafting in your house. I have to open inventory, take what I want out, close inventory, craft, and then put everything back. The UI is not well thought out. I understand it's \"realistic,\" but I don't consider the airports being a pain in the *** and vendors who won't stfu to be something that a game needs. They have either lost their minds and don't realize how tedious this was before even releasing the game (Do you playtest), or they just didn't care. either of the two is ridiculous, especially for a globally-established company.","It\u2019s decent just don\u2019t plan on having more than one island per switch. Gotta love Nintendo.","The basic concept is fun and addictive.\r HOWEVER, the co-op and multiplayer is ATROCIOUS!\r 1. We bought the game mainly so my wife, son, and I could play co-op. We were so excited to travel together and explore other people's Islands. TOO BAD. For some nonsensical reason, that is not allowed. Couch co-op is ONLY allowed on your island. And on top of that, the options for players 2, 3 &amp; 4 are drastically limited. So much missed potential with this feature.\r 2. Only the first character to be created (the Island Representative) can travel to other islands online. I made my character 2nd, and I cannot travel online. It tells me I need to buy an additional Nintendo Online subscription. That means that if I am playing my character, I am pretty much stuck on our island. Why would Nintendo do this? Why should I need two online subscriptions for one game, on one Switch? I can't think of any logical reason to do this. Seems like blatant greed, to me.\r Games released a decade ago have had more robust multiplayer than this. I just don't understand how, in the year 2020, a company as experienced as Nintendo can do such a poor job on such an important feature.\r I see that I am not the only one complaining about these features. I hope Nintendo listens to its fans, and fixes them in the near future.","One island per console?? Are you joking? This is absolutely absurd. Whoever made that decision is either a senseless idiot or a malicious prick. This is a great game with an even greater, crippling flaw. This is a family console we're playing on, folks, not a Gameboy.","I can definitely say that the game is extremely enjoyable. It\u2019s very nice to sit down to on yet another day at home, and it kept me coming back each day. That is, of course, until I discovered that I couldn\u2019t change the island representative. By then I was already too far into the game. I enjoy playing with the real time aspect of Animal Crossing so when it\u2019s taken more than a month to get where I\u2019m at on my own account, along with being forced to also progress another player that my brother no longer uses, it makes me furious to see that every solution I try to turn to says the same thing: if I want to become the island representative I have to delete the entire game\u2019s save data. It\u2019s simply impossible for me to do that after putting all this time into a game that I really truly love. It\u2019s a shame that I can\u2019t enjoy it any further after all my hard work.","After looking forward to this game ever since the Switch came out, I am highly disappointed overall.  The spawn rate of good bugs and better fish is so low that it really makes the game no fun.  As a nurse, working through this time of this virus, I want to come home and relax with my game, but am finding that it\u2019s more frustrating than relaxing.  What would be the harm in increasing the rate of the better fish and bugs and making the game more fun and relaxing.  I just don\u2019t get why Nintendo wants to take away the fun of the game.  I enjoyed fishing and catching bugs in New Leaf.  But now the spawn rate is so low of any of the more challenging bugs and fish. I would not recommend this game to friends, and am seriously considering selling my Switch and my game.  I am to the point where it\u2019s just not fun for me anymore.  Thanks a lot Nintendo.","Although I like the game, it looses half of its score due to the one island rule.  It is incredibly stupid, that my wife and I cannot play our own islands on a $60 game.","By and large a good game, this, but it does get very repetitive, unless you love decorating - as that what it simply boils down to in the end. I played this lots more than I expected when it first came out, and was pleasantly surprised about that, but as soon as the \"story\" mode was over - the game was essentially over for me, there's very little incentive to real play any further unless you're really into decorating and getting lots of stuff. I personally don't know why everyone seem so bothered about which villagers they have - sure, they're charming up to a point, but I found them all incredibly shallow - very often repeating themselves, and offering little sense of the AI I expected seeing how attached some people seem to get to these characters. Overall, a positive surprise, but it does get very repetitive and boring eventually.","Lifelong Nintendo-fan here. Can't even appropriately convey my disappointment with Nintendo for the One Switch, One Island rule. I expect things like this from EA but have never in my life encountered a move like this from Nintendo. My wife and I bought a Switch Lite to share together, and she was lucky enough to play Animal Crossing first. When I hopped on and had the slow realization that I would be confined to the Island she lived on unless I was willing to purchase a second console (not a second game cartridge, which I might have considered) my heart just sank. Nintendo really screwed the pooch on this one and from the other reviews I sense that they've already lost a lot of customers. Not that they care, apparently, as there is no news of change on the horizon. Gave it at least a one because it was fun watching my wife enjoy it, but now we both feel cheated.","Terraria is much much more worth it. A very shallow console cashgrabbing Nintendo nonsence","This is definitely the best game in the Animal Crossing series and one of the best games available on the Switch in my opinion. There are definitely some small quality of life issues but they by no means ruin the game. It's adorable and relaxing and so easy to throw hours and hours of your time into without even realizing it. You can play for an hour one day and then get tired of it but the need to come back the next day and check in on everything is always there.","Only one island per switch. Only one island representative(person who advances game), and unable to transfer it. Otherwise gameplay is ok, if you like to design stuff(island, house).","Nintendo has gotten greedy. They dont allow separate islands unless you have another switch, which is a problem because only the island leader gets to do things that are fun. And also, my sister can go through the island getting all the rocks, fruit and weeds so i dont get to do anything other than fish. They should make it like the older games where you can have multiple characters, but they should do that all in one profile, so that if you want to you can have your own island or share one, or both at once. I only gave it a 3 because of the graphics. But if they fixed the one island thing it would be a 9 or 10","Poco innovador, gr\u00e1ficos que parecen porteados de la versi\u00f3n de 3ds, copia muchas cosas de juegos como Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley etc historia poco trabajada y practicamente inexistente","If i have to be sincere... Only is fun for 1 person because the rest of people who want to live in the island can\u2019t participate in the projects. This means that if the principal player don\u2019t progress in the game, the rest of the players can\u2019t progress too. Does this means that if i want to participate in the decisions of creating the island i have to buy another game? I don\u2019t see very fair and economic doing this.I hope Nintendo decides to do an actualization soon deleting all this barriers to the rest of players in the game.","First off, the game is beautiful and I haven't experienced any glitches since launch. It's fun and the new details are very cute and a big upgrade since the last games. The ability to customize your island is so cool and it gives your island a sense of uniqueness. There is a lot more customization that you were only able to dream about in the previous games....\rHowever, what forces me to give this game a 5/10 is the fact that it is not finished. Right now, we are at a stand still in the game. If you have ran out of ideas on how to decorate the island, then there is nothing else for you to do. There is no additional store upgrades, no Roost, Dream Suite, or anything else that we use to have in previous games. We are essentially stuck in the early phases of the game until Nintendo decides to give us an update.\rAlso, the use of updates is a cop out for Nintendo to sell us a full priced game that is NOT FINISHED. There is also very limited villager interactions as well. In pocket camp, the villagers actually use the furniture that you have set up. They actually use the half pipe, Ferris wheel, etc, where as all they do is sit down on the chairs or benches in ACNH. That is very frustrating when I have spent days decorating a carnival, a wedding venue, a dinner, and a library and they don't even use them.\rThis game can be fun, however it is not finished. It is different from the animal crossing that I have known and loved because it has turned into more of a decorating game. Especially since there are currently no further advances in the game (store upgrades/ additional stores), so you pretty much reach the \"end\" like you would when you have played after 5 years and have nothing else to do. I really want to love this game, but playing it makes me really want to just pull out my 3DS and play Wild World or New Leaf.\rI say wait a few years to purchase until Nintendo gets it's stuff together and actually finish the game.","So i just bought a new brand game and then went for my girlfriend to pick her from work and make her happy,but when i was waiting for her i started reading back label and i saw that i can make only ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH, the same \"\"\"\"\"family\"\"\"\"\" sharable portable console that nintendo advertasing to us... just **** off... i went back to store and got my money back and nintendo will never see a penny from me for any of their consoles in future..well done.","The game don't let\u2019s play the others users! Only the principal user can play the complete history.","Like everyone else, it\u2019s annoyingly that since my son started the game, my wife and I can\u2019t do anything because we\u2019re just bystanders.  The 1 island limitation is also a major annoyance! Nintendo please change the limitations or fix it!","In the end of the day, it's a fun game that you can spend long hours into and it's a good game to pass your time by.\r Really liked the amount of things you can collect (e.g. furniture, fish, clothes, etc. )  and the level of customization you can have on your island, house, character and so on.  The fact that they keep updating the game with new content and events to bring more to the game is also a plus and it gives value to it. The sound and graphics are simple but fine for this kind of genre. The gameplay is good and easy to learn.\r The one island per console was a really let down for sure, I bought this game not only for me but for my girlfriend too, and despite the fact that I already knew about this issue, I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. Has I played first I got to be the Citizen Representative and that removed a lot of gameplay, which includes assignments and objectives, from the second player. The multiplayer in the same console is also really weak, not giving many things to do to the player that is not in command.\r In summary, as I said, I liked it, but after spending more than 20 hours into the game I kinda felt a little bored with the the concept and the fact that after some time you keep doing the same things all over again, and you lose the purpose to play. In the future with the new updates and new content that they keep adding I may feel tempted to give it another try and spend a few more hours into the game.","it's a polished game but graphics could have been better. and should have more than one island for one system","This game is so much fun, and it keeps expanding the more you play! Definitely worth it, and still playing it!","The multi-player experience is really bad.  If you are not first player, you can't advance the story.  This would probably be a fun game if you played alone, but my my experience as player 2 was very disappointing.","COMPLETE BS NINTENDOI got this game on my birthday nintendo about 3 days ago. At the time i got animal crossing new horizons i wasn't really feeling to play the game so i let my six year old brother do it because he was very excited about the game. Now that i try to logg on animal crossing With MY ACOUNT i get sent to his island because for some reason you can only have on island per SWITCH yes you HEARD ME ONE SHARED ISLAND S W I T C H now i cant even proggres in the game because ALL accounts share the same island and ONLY the player/account who started up the island is the only one who can proggress. Just great nintendo now i cant even play the game i got on my birthday properly. I think this should be heavily more criticized so people know before they buy. i demand an update to fix this poor design choice.","Only having one island per console no matter how many copies are purchased is outrageous. It robs players of the full experience of the game as only one player has the full experience. This can cause arguments in families as to who is allowed to be that player. The Nintendo Switch and Animal Crossing: New Horizons are meant to be a family console and game. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is meant to allow players to create and design their own islands but this is not possible with only one save file. This just proves how greedy Nintendo is. It would be reasonable if it was an island per copy but it\u2019s a cheap money tactic that Nintendo has included to rob fans of the game. No other game has this problem. If you want to play Super Mario Odyssey then you have your own save file for each account but Nintendo understands that Animal Crossing is a huge nostalgia game so they took advantage of it to try get more money.","I have many brothers and sisters, and for me animal crossing was a way out of my dysfunctional family, an escapism. I wanted to relax and spend hours upon hours building a \"game life\" where I wasn't as stressed out as I am in real life. Turns out I'm stuck on my brother's island. I hate you Nintendo, change that 1 island per switch nonsense. Greedy company. NEVER AGAIN WILL I SUPPORT NINTENDO!!!!!","Not a game for me, really boring, I hated the thing you can only have one island, but maybe it\u00b4s cool for anyone else...","No review text.","One save game per switch is a **** move. **** is actually a complement tbh, I really feel this is not far off from the greediest moves some game companies (lookong ar you EA) make.","Listen, I love this game and have sunk over 400 hours into it. It's my second most played game ever right behind Minecraft which I've owned for over 8 years. 400 hours in 4 months is a ton of time for me in a game.\rHowever, I have reached a point where I'd love to have more islands to make more themed towns. I'm too attached to my first island to just kick all my villagers off and go searching for all penguins to make an ice themed island. But I can't use my creativity on more than just one island because there is only one island per Switch! I sincerely hope Nintendo patches the game so you can have at least up to 8 Islands on the console to match the number of accounts. Other games function in this manner where each account has a separate save file, why can't Animal Crossing?","Found out today that there's a one island per switch limit... Didn't think to check for this before purchasing because it seems obvious that the system is capable of having at LEAST one island per account. I can tell by the vast number of reviews that mention this feature that I'm not the only person who made that assumption. Giving this one star because I still have hope that this could be a good game, but for now it's more like something I paid $60 to watch someone else enjoy.","As someone who played New Leaf for the 3DS, the differences between the games are night and day. Where New Horizons took 2 steps forward it also takes 5 steps back when it comes to features and additions.200 hours in, the new features (outdoor decor, terraforming, DIY\u2019s) fail to make up for the countless features from previous games that don\u2019t show up. Some missing features are furniture (1,764 in NL vs 804 in NH, less than half), the HHA Showcase, island mini games, some holidays (April Fools and Earth Day so far), Nintendo themed fortune cookie items, gyroids, the Cafe, fortune telling, and the dream suite are the most notable absences in the game. Features aside, many fan-favorite characters don\u2019t make a return in the game: Kapp\u2019n, the Resetti Brothers, Pete, Pelly, Phyllis, Tortimer, Digby, and Gracie Grace are ALL absent from the game.This is not to say these characters and features won\u2019t show up in one of many planned procedural updates, but the absence of all these features and characters becomes evident once the player accomplished many of the goals set by both the game and themselves. There isn\u2019t much to do in the game after you achieve your 5-Star island. No more shop upgrades to look forward to for the time being, no more shops to open up, no more islands to visit, no mini games to play with your friends, no small distractions that were abundantly present in previous games.The lack of content in Animal Crossing New Horizons and the presence of procedural updates is a sign of Nintendo\u2019s complacency within the larger game industry. Halo MCC faced a similar lack of content compared to previous games when many of the game modes present in previous entries were unavailable on the release date. An entire year after the release of the game, all of the previous features have been added in. I fear this will be the fate of New Horizons. Whether for their own profit or to stave off time-travelers, Nintendo has chosen to give fans an IV-drip of new content into the game. It took over 2 months for diving to make a return to the game, a feature that was available in New Leaf upon release.There has also been a noticeable decline in the quality of the features that do return. Characters like Isabelle have been relegated to repeating the same lines of dialogue every time you boot up the game: the same line about her missing sock or the comedian she watched on TV or one of the five other speech options she cycles through every week. Nook\u2019s Cranny has only one upgrade as of July 2020, whereas NL had 4 upon release.New Horizons does give players a much higher level of customizability than any previous game. Although the furniture options are severely limited, players can reshape the majority of the island to whatever they desire, they can place villager homes in any location they wish, and they can decorate areas outside of the player\u2019s home. Creating custom clothing is given more versatility with more clothes types and now player designs are no longer pixelated, but rounded out when placed onto clothing items. Previously immovable objects such as rocks can be broken to be spawned in a more desirable area. The majority of fun from the game will come from the goals the player sets for themselves when playing the game, which is an issue if you struggle creatively. If you weren\u2019t a super creative person, in previous games there were goals that could keep you playing day after day: additional store upgrades, building new stores, and playing off the more expensive debts for your larger house in NL. Even if you do enjoy being creative with your island, once you\u2019ve achieved your 5-Star island, there isn\u2019t anything major for you to work towards: no upgrades, no stores, and no upgrades for the small side rooms in your house.Small features you would expect to be in any game are also missing. No options menu to change things like music volume, no ability to donate to other people\u2019s museums, no giving fish or bugs to other players, and most egregiously, no way to have multiple islands on the same console. If you have a spouse or family member who also wants to start their own island, they can\u2019t just hop on another profile, they can\u2019t even just buy bother copy of the game, they have to buy an entirely new switch and another copy of the game. This makes the cost of having two save files in one household go up to at least US$280. In past games, all you had to do was either buy a new memory card on the GameCube or buy another copy of the game to have another village. Many other reviewers talk about this issue with the game and there really is no reason other than greed for Nintendo to make this change from previous games.It feels like Animal Crossing New Horizons knew exactly what new features to bring to the game to please fans, but in bringing in the amazing new features, Nintendo failed to bring in so many of the fun, memorable, and important features and characters from the previous games.","This game looks pretty cool. My wife bought a Switch just for it. I wanted to give it a try and attempted to make my own Island but found that you can only have one Island per account, even with a different profile. I thought to myself, \"Wow this really sucks, you have to buy another copy of the game if more than one person in the household wants to play. I'm glad I don't have kids.\" Then i read that even if you buy another copy of the game, you would need to buy a 2nd Switch. That is greedy AF.\r Now i remember why Nintendo 64 was the last Nintendo product I ever purchased, and will likely ever purchase in the future.","Had to buy a second switch to have my own save file, **** this anti-consumer **** from nintendo\rThe game is fun though, this review would be a 10/10 otherwise","Buying this game to play together sucks, only one person gets an island. The second player barely get any rights and is not fun at all. very dissapointed in this choice by nintendo","Such a great game, ruined by a GROSSLY OUTDATED game structure. I understand that 1 island only is kind of a series staple, but this do not make it justifiable in this day and age. I bought the game in order to play it with my gf, and right now the game is nearly unplayable in local coop. I bought the game to let my sister create another island of her own, and this is straight up not possible. Such a good game ruined either by unjustifiable ignorance or unredeemable greed. Mah","Nintendo tricked my family into getting this game. I thought it would be fun but you can only have one island per switch. My sister opened the game first so she gets to be the mayor and I don\u2019t get to make decisions or do anything interesting. The only way to fully enjoy this game as a multi person household is to buy another switch. Of course nobody is going to do that. I was super disappointed and I thought that the game would be fun. Nintendo please fix this the fans need you to.","I bought this game for me and my girlfriend to share, but it became clear right away that it was unplayable for Player 2. No involvement with progression, can't help upgrade the island, doesn't get Diy recipes, and the other villagers don't even interact with her as much as me. With how a 2nd copy of the game won't allow for another island like with previous titles it's obvious that Nintendo just wants us to buy a 2nd switch. The biggest cash grab I've seen from Nintendo since Mario Cart Tour.","I\u2019ve never played an AC game before. I love life-sim games. This AC reminds me of the Sims, but if the Sims bred with Minecraft and made a game with a terrible UI and a slight superiority complex through the stupid real time method- you MUST wait 24 hours to build this museum, HA. HA.\r It has four main facets of gameplay. Resource grinding, hunting, customisation/crafting and multiplayer. I\u2018ll go through these.\r 1. Resources\r Grinding for resources, which you have to do with constantly breaking tools, is painful and will lead to mild insanity early in the game. You need wood? Hit that tree. You need stone? Hit that rock. Never-ending. Also, there aren\u2019t enough resources on your island, so you have to fly to other ones created for resource grinding- this costs a stupid amount of in-game currency.\r 2. \u2018Hunting\u2019.\rYou can catch bugs, fish, sea creatures and dig up fossils, all of which you give to the museum. This is fun enough and relatively interesting.\r 3. Customisation.\r You start on a deserted island. By the third realtime day if you\u2019ve played quite a lot you\u2019ll get some cool furniture to craft. By the 9th or 10th you\u2019ll get terraforming. The customisation options are relatively wide ranging once you acquire them- but the time it takes is stupid and irritating. However, you can immediately design clothing, which is pretty awesome.\r Placing furniture, however, is one of the most frustrating things- without a useful placing system you just have to drop it and hope it lands in the right place. Sometimes, even when there\u2019s loads of room, the game says \u2018no room to place things here\u2019- one of the many irritating unskippable dialogue boxes. Also, moving things like trees is irritating- you have to eat. One. Apple. At. A. Time. Dig the tree up. Plant it. Making a forest is difficult to say the least.\r 4. Multiplayer.\r If you have Nintendo Online, for 4 dollars a month you can visit other\u2019s islands with full chat facilities (beware if your kid is young and you don\u2019t want them talking to strangers). This is good, because you can see people\u2019 efforts to customise their islands and hang out with them.\r So, in conclusion- this game is both fun (because of the customisation options) and deeply frustrating. For a game based on creating a desert island in your own way, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to unlock customisation options and there\u2019s much, much too much grinding. Time travel is necessary to avoid deep boredom.\r Buy it if you like life sims and aren\u2019t bothered by grinding for resources.","El hecho de que halla limitaciones en la isla con respecto al primer usuario no permite disfrutar a varios usuarios del juego y trata a todos los que no lo hallan iniciado como invitados en el juego que solo tienen disponible una demo del juego a\u00fan teniendolo","My sister bought a switch and the game, we both want to play it and have our own islands. We can\u2019t afford to buy A WHOLE OTHER SWITCH!!! This is a dumb moneygrab it\u2019s obvious, make multiple save files to the game and update it! One person will have fun on the game while the other one is left with nothing to do but collect sticks (no decision making whatsoever). If you have multiple kids and don\u2019t want to here them fight and whine over not getting to actually have fun in the game, don\u2019t get it! I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo, the game is great but useless for those who are not the island owner!JUST ADD MULTIPLE SAVE FILES!","Bought this game for my kids to play. We have 2 switches and 3 kids. Imagine my disappointment finding out that they each cant start there own islands because of the console limitations. What a terrible terrible limitation to implement. Very disappointed in Nintendo. My own fault for not doing enough research (one I wont make again in the future). If I would have known about this before making my purchase I would have chosen not to buy this game.","On one hand, I actually like the durability system and the fact that you can craft so many different things, and also the game will always be relaxing and relatively stress-free. On the other hand, the characters are incredibly dry, you can only have one island per console, and for me, the game gets stale after about a week. Also pretty much everything is locked behind a time wall. I don't think it's a bad game, and definitely recommend this to anyone who has not played an animal crossing game before, but it is nothing compared to New Leaf.","This game was incredibly hyped up and I was so excited for its release that I pre ordered the game. I\u2019m so dissatisfied with this game. Animal Crossing is a series with so much charm and quirkiness and this game has destroyed that. Also there is a lack of content, I always am doing the same things everyday. When I played/play New Leaf I feel like there\u2019s always SOMETHING I can do to have fun. I\u2019m really hoping these updates they\u2019ve promised for 3 years make the game enjoyable, but for now I can\u2019t play this god awful game!","First of all, the user score here is very unreliable as it appears the same person has made a ton of accounts to complain about the way Multiplayer functions and you can tell it's the same person because every account has only one review and it's for Animal Crossing New Horizons.\r With that being said, the game has some serious issues. It is severely dumbed down from New Leaf to a very disappointing degree. There are less fish to catch, less bugs, Museum is smaller, less shops, less shop upgrades, less furniture, less clothes and less house upgrades. All of these have been changed in favor of a crafting system that is painfully shallow and does not at all make up for the lost content. Nintendo is adding content over time but it's at a painfully slow rate and what is being added is not even close to what this game needs to be as good as New Leaf. If you are deciding whether to buy this game and haven't played New Leaf then you should just buy New Leaf instead.","This game is the most disappointed i've ever been with a game I was hyped for. The first 2 months was a great time. It was fun filling out my fossil, bug, and fish collection, and trying to rank up my island. I hit 5 stars, got my fossil collection to 100%, got my house to max rank, and slowly lost my will to play. There is nothing else to do. The landscaping tools are too slow and cumbersome to incite me to redesign my island. Catching new bugs and fish stops being exciting. I have 10,000,000 bells from how easy and exploitable the Stalk Market is. You and other people can't modify an island while hosting, leading all multiplayer sessions to devolve into you becoming a tour guide for 10 minutes. The animal dialogue is repetitive and boring. Nook Miles stop being an incentive to do anything later on due to the absurdly grindy goals you have to do.\rThe core gameplay loop stops being fun after a month, and makes me regret spending $60 on the game. Nobody I know that picked the game up at launch still consistently plays, and ive heard countless people say the same thing online. They're trying to add new content, but it's far too little, too late and I couldn't be bothered. Whenever I turn the game on, I play for less than 10 minutes, and go play something else. I want to love this game so bad after playing New Leaf daily for *years* but I just can't. Its a rushed, boring mess that has no right to be in the same prestigious series as Animal Crossing.\rIf you want to play an Animal Crossing game, you're better off playing New Leaf or Gamecube. This is not worth your time or money. The game is beyond saving with seasonal updates. The core gameplay loop is not fun. I am a long time fan that only wants the best from the series, and New Horizons isn't it.","An interesting introduction for me to the Animal Crossing franchise, but a forgetful one at times..\r I was browsing in a store one day with my family till I saw the Animal Crossing game on the shelf. Hearing everything that was great about the game, I thought I would give it a go. I absolutely loved the first few weeks of playing, with tutorials being idiot-proof whilst also bringing adventure to your mind, where you can ponder what is behind that river on your island.\r I also absolutely loved the fact that you could buy tickets to visit new, intriguing areas where you can expand your own island's population from. The art style is very pleasing on the eyes and I the music when I boot up the game almost always gives me a joyous feeling. However, I rarely hear that music anymore...\r After around 1 and a half months of playing, I just stopped. I had accomplished everything I had wanted to, bridging to new areas, getting nicer equipment and upping my population. I had realised then that the game mostly was about collecting and decorating. It just did not feel satisfying when I placed a piece of furniture or caught a new fish where a few more pixels where coloured than the other fish I caught 2 minutes ago.\r A few days ago, my sister wanted to hop on and play, but little did we know, a 1 island per console restriction permitted that.\r Another drawback was the date and time \"hacks\" everyone pulled off with the reselling of turnips, that ruined a lot of fun when friends would just visit me and drop money everywhere whilst I wanted to catch fish and earn bells the legit way.\r Overall, this Animal Crossing game can be quite flawed in some ways but I did enjoy my time while I found it fun. I recommend it still as games with stories can take tens of hours to finish until you stop playing, whereas with this game, HUNDREDS of hours can be put in and you can still be having the time of your life!","There are only two kind of reviews here. The \"only one island per console\" critic and the people who love the game.\r But I think that's not the only problem with the game. From my side there are two huge problems with the game.\r You can't do really much on your island. You're possible actions on the island are extremely limited and the size of the island is small. There isn't much discover on your island. The game seems to miss a lot of feature to keep you interested for a longer time to play. Sure there are other Islands to discover, but they are randomly generated, small and don't add something new. They're just like your island with the same actions to do.\rYou can't plant different vegetables/fruit and farm it. You can't have animals for milking. There are Apple trees. But you can't make apple juice or marmalade. You can only pick up the apples and sell it. There aren't secret dungeons to discover, mysteries to solve. You can craft new items and furniture, but they're mostly only cosmetic and don't add new features. There is no discovery or crafting system to keep you interested.\r They added a real time day. So it's always the same date and time as in real life. You can't go to sleep and wake up on the next morning in the game. That add a huge time-sink in the game. You can play about 15min and then your daily \"work\" on the island is done and you have to wait till the next day. The same with the seasons, you have to play for a year to see every season in the game.\r From my point of view, the game seems unfinished and miss a lot of features to keep you interested for a longer period of time","Absolutely unforgivable! Bought this game with my sister and She played for first and now i am a little more than an NPC! I want to play the full game! Embarassing in 2020 something like that!","Only one island per switch is stupid. I have multiple family members and will not buy an extra Switch. Disgusting money grab.","It\u2019s a fun game but the multiplayer options for this game when played on the same Switch are ridiculous and warrant a 0 rating. Only the \u201cprimary\u201d player (the first player on the island) is able to progress through the storyline and complete certain quests. I\u2019ve been running around the island for three days now and I can\u2019t get an axe to progress further because the primary player of the game has lost interest already and hasn\u2019t opened the axe up in their game. So I have to either log in as them and play as them and do these things or quit. I choose to quit the game. This is a ridiculous way to design a game. I find it mind boggling that developers sat down in meetings during development, discussed this, and decided it was a great idea.  Then that great idea was coded, tested, and still made it into the final cut. How does something like this get implemented?  Have these developers ever played a multiplayer game?  Who actually thinks like this?  Who wants to play a game and be eliminated from content just because they are not the \u201cfirst\u201d player of the game?  Who tested this feature and liked it?  It\u2019s just dumb game design, period.I have asked for a refund, not sure if it will be approved but the request has been made.","it's just so stupid that you can only have one island per console. im the 2nd player which means that i hardly get to do anything no building structures and no story. fix this now Nintendo","I am actively writing this review while playing with my husband \"primary account holder\" . I have time to write, because the \"secondary\" player on the switch account can never play a large portion of the game. Without having 2 switches, secondary player has no input on tasks to building up the island. It was my first animal crossing and my husband was excited to introduce me to this game. But so far this game has left me without any experiences, because they're only for the main account holder to complete.. It's a simple fix that Nintendo has refused to acknowledge.","As an relative starter for the series, I started playing New Leaf on the 3DS to decide whether or not I should buy this game on launch.Oh boy, I was hooked. I absolutely love every aspect of the game, and playing it makes my day so much happier and more calm.This is not a conventional game. It\u2019s definitely not for everyone and people should know what they\u2019re getting into before buying. But if you have patience, if like a tranquil, gorgeous experience and enjoy the little things in life, this game may be for you.","Bought this for my wife and she loves it, I wanted to play so we could share the experience only to find out I couldn\u2019t have my own island. Looking into second players on this game seems to be pointless as they can\u2019t actually do anything. Would be a stellar review (from what I\u2019ve seen of my wife playing) if not for this ridiculous one island rule.","We are 3 people in this family who wants to play this game with our own Islands, now Nintendo demands us to buy one console each to be able to do so?!?!?! I love Nintendo and have supported them for 25 years, but this was a big blow....","Don't buy the game if you're sharing it with a family member, or someone like that. Overall, the game is great, except for one big problem which reviews are not addressing, and could be a deal breaker for some people. That is how you have to share one island per console, and only the person who arrives on the island first gets the full game experience. I don't understand why Nintendo would do that, and it ruins the experience for many people including my sister who joined the island second. It just seems greedy to me!","Local multiplayer and one island per console just shows how greedy Nintendo has become.","I'm an Animal Crossing superfan, and because of that alone I'm enjoying this game a lot. HOWEVER, my score is simply because I don't think this game should be rewarded for how much it fails to deliver. The one island per console thing was bad enough, but then on top of that, your subsequent user accounts have a limited experience in the game too. Only one person gets to have the full Animal Crossing experience and that's awful for a family game. It goes far beyond that as well, though. So many of the features, items, and even signature characters from previous games have been completely taken away in this. There's some reviews on this page that list most of these things that were taken out, but the point is, this game feels unfinished and rushed. The good news is: Nintendo can definitely fix this with updates, DLC, and general fixes. The bad news is... I'm not so sure they'll actually do it. I can see them adding in *some* of the missing features, but I'll have to wait and see if they'll actually make this feel like a finished game and fix the issue of multiple people wanting their own island. I wouldn't even mind paying for the game again to have another island. For now, though, it feels incomplete and a bit unsatisfying for a huge Animal Crossing fan.","My wife and I were soooo looking forward to playing this game, and when she started I thought it was great. But when I went to start my own game and realized I couldn't have my own island, also that my functions were limited on her island, the game was absolutely ruined for me. I cannot justify buying another switch just to play this game","The game literally has no long term objectives local multiplayer is horrible especially since you cant purchase a second switch anywhere. The fact that most of the game is acquiring clothing and furniture for a house i dont ever care to expand and i have to wait months and months in real to get new bugs or fish is just insane. Ive never traded in a game before or sold it but this one definitely takes the cake.","By having one island per console is a bad strategy for users to get more consoles.","One Island limitation is so **** up.\rGameplay was ok until I checked my gf can not play her one islad so we decided to get the money back. We dont want to support such a move.","I wanted to like this game. It's sweet, it's beautiful, it's funny, but... I'm a player 2. I have less than half of the resources of the \"mayor\", I can't advance anything on my own, I can't build anything. It's no less than frustrating and hurtful to see my boyfriend play our game, and have all of the buildings, DIY's, and character options. I hope they change this, because until then, this game is unplayable.","Nul... Seul le tout premier joueur peut faire avancer le jeu.. Le deuxi\u00e8me est bloqu\u00e9 si le premier n'avance pas le jeu..

This is a single player game, anyone else living on your island can\u2019t do anything but fish and improve their house. If your not player one you literally can\u2019t do anything on the island. What the hell nintendo at least give us the option to change who is the main person. Was loving the game but now I can\u2019t even play it.","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A SCAM!It is a total scam. Only 1 player in your house gets to actually play the game. Seriously. Even if you have multiple cartrages, only the first player to start an island gets their own island. Evergone else who joins later becomes a guest on that players island. Only that player gets to place  buildings and progress the game.The only way for everyone in your house to enjoy the full game is to caugh up an extra  $300 per person for individual consoles. There needs to be a mass boycott of this game and its design studio until they fix this outrageous travesty.","If you have 2 kids (or more) and they both want to play this game in a peacefull democratc way, then don't buy this game. You can only create 1 island, the first player that creates this island = boss in other words this game is created for 1 player or for households with multiple nintendo switches.","After a week, I honestly regret playing this game at all. I put up with the slow early pacing, the clumsy core gameplay elements (effectively untouched since the Gamecube days), and the tedious and dull crafting system, because the level of creative potential that New Horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing. But like some sort of Sisyphean hell, true creative freedom is agonizingly restricted by the poorly thought-out mechanics, leaving me feeling miserable for having wasted my time in the first place.\r New Horizons' most prominent additions are hamstrung by half-baked, outdated, inconvenient, and unintuitive design decisions, making them far too frustrating or shallow to be worthwhile.\r The new terraforming tools, for example, give an unparalleled ability to treat the island as your personal canvas. However, by the time you unlock them, your town will be populated by around 15 buildings such as stores and homes, many of which you'll likely want to move once you gain the ability to freely create rivers and paths. In Stardew Valley (a $15 indie game developed primarily by a single person), the interface for moving farm buildings is incredibly simple and convenient: pick up a building, and pop it down where you want it; boom, done. In New Horizons, moving a building to an altogether new location involves paying a substantial sum of money ($50,000 bells) and waiting overnight. It's even worse If you wish to only move a building slightly, as you have no choice but to first move it somewhere else, then move it back where you want it (requiring $100,000 bells and two days; and you can only move one building a day). I play with time traveling, yet having to wait day after day after day to move multiple buildings around is still incredibly obnoxious even for me; I'm sorry for anyone who's actually trying to play this game in real-time.\r Another botched new feature is the crafting system. Tools break incredibly quickly, and crafting more is an obnoxiously slow process. Resource gathering is shallow and awkward, amounting to little more than brainlessly smacking rocks and trees. For some ungodly reason, a crafting bench placed in your house cannot use resources you've stored in your home's sole Storage menu, meaning you have to pointlessly retrieve and later re-store multiple types of materials every single time you go to craft. In summary, the crafting system is incredibly half-baked, pointlessly time-wasting, and the minor benefit of being able to craft some simple furniture is capsized by the disastrously tedious tool replacement loop.\r New Horizons allows you to switch between a front-view camera angle (as seen in New Leaf) and a more top-down angle (similar to the Gamecube version). This is a huge improvement over previous entries in this series.... and yet still comically half-baked by the standards of the broader industry. Why can't Animal Crossing just have the same camera controls that have been standard in third-person 3D games for 20 years?","The game is nice, smooth, fun, everything I love into a video game.  so my mark is 10/10\r but... there is a terrible point that is the fact that only one island can be created per CONSOLE !\runacceptable, and regarding this decision the game desserves a -9 points markdown.\r so it's 1/10","I felt the need to give my husband his half of the money back when we realized that he would be a glorified visitor. I started the game first because he drove and I started playing it on the way home after getting it.\rEven if we wanted to get another Switch and another copy of the game, we can't. (Plus that's another $360 down the drain, or $260 if we want drifting issues we can't get fixed out the box.) By the time we can we'll both have moved on to something else.\rI enjoy the game a lot more than he does, that's for sure. I'm glad that there's BL3 DLC that he can enjoy instead.\r I'm sorry I want to spend my $60 the way I want to.","one island per console. greedy and unfair, an anti-consumer practice and is disappointing to say the least","One island per console?\rThat is plain stupid. It is a move my nintendo for you to buy more consoles. The saddest thing of all is that it is working...","I was upset at first about \"one island per console,\" but because of it I've found the value in their decision.  My wife and I leave little surprises and gifts for each other since we're co-located, and nothing is really lost progression-wise.  If she gets something setup first, then I can still attend ceremonies and experience the \"newness\" of the island growing.  Though the museum's donations are shared (which I like), you still have to find things yourself for them to be added to your \"creature codex\" so progression issues are not felt.  I can understand people want their own unique island so they can fly to each others' and visit and whatnot, but so much Animal Crossing Charm comes from sharing your space.\r Just make sure you buy doctors masks and gift them out.","Although the 1 Switch 1 save file is terribly frustrating, this game is still really amazing. It's simply the best Animal Crossing game to date.","Is such a shame not being able to create your own islands. Yo can\u2019t even have your own experience trough the game","As someone who is brand new to the series I have certainly enjoyed it thus far. I've got my first house upgrade. I really enjoy the relaxing nature of the game. We have two switches in our house, so we won't be sharing the game. But given the size of the map, I don't really see that as much of a problem. It's not a perfect game, but it's a good game with a minimum of problems. The load times really haven't been as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be and I am playing it as a digital download as opposed to a cartridge. I enjoy the crafting in the game and it can be slow paced at times, most of the time. I can make a ton of money doing whatever I want. I like fishing, so the majority of my money has been from that. Even the crappy tools last a fair bit of time. It does what Animal Crossing games set out to do, to be relaxing and fun. I would love to share my island with other users on my switch, it would be a combined effort, expanding a community of friends and family. Something other reviewers aren't considering. This is a great and does what it set out to do. 8/10.","This game is fantastic, a brand new feel to the game that pulls it off well. But one question remains, why does this game have so many bad reviews? Most of them seem to be bland reviews that are most likely spam.","The worst game for families due to the priority of one player. The player who names the island is the main player and the others are so limited in their gameplay. Trying to force people to buy another switch. Limitations of second player include:- Not being able to complete a lot of the quests.- Not being able to buy or craft tools unless the first player has unlocked them before hand.- Not being able to move buildings.- The First player getting all DIY recipes collected by the second player or themselves. Whereas the second player only gets the ones they have collected. - Limited creatures available to catch. In my experience the second player is a lot less likely to get wasps from trees etc. These are probably not all of the limitations for the second player but they are the ones that I have stumbled upon.It is a great game for the first player but I wouldn\u2019t buy if you are wanting to play with others. This just seems like an excuse to make people go out and buy another switch which I believe to be outrageous.","One of the biggest oversights, imho, is that you cant go to Nook Miles islands together. Instead when I visit my wife's island I just mill about occasionally helping gather wood and water her plants, which just diminishes her ability to play her island. I dont even give gifts in person anymore since unlocking the postcards to friends feature so theres really no reason to visit.\rMeanwhile if we could all visit an island together, we could at least have fun in a little gathering instance; running around trying to find the best / cool stuff and meeting new villagers together.","This game is cute and family friendly at the first glance. However if you have more than one person who wants to play this game it immedately goes from cute little farming game to frustrating hellscape.","I really do not like the single island decission. It does not let me play the game I like. My child does not have the chance, to have the full gaming experience.","It is sad to realize that a lot is done for money, to sell switch again and again.\r Even if the game present some new features (in 2020 wow...) you can't enjoy the full experience;\r In one hand because the \"story-line\" or the building progression can evolve only with the \"island's owner\" (the first player) and so all the others need to wait...\r In the second hand because when you play as a couch coop player (i don't know for the online multiplayer) you are restricted, you cannot open your inventory and cannot use crafting, well, you can \"switch\" to be leader and recover these things but this is boring...\r And I don't talk about the lack of more interactions with object\r So in the end, even if you accept the fact that there will be just one island in the console you have to face 2 major problems that constantly remind you that Nintendo WANT money\r It really affect the multiplayer experience so for me the new features are cool but the restriction sucks too much\rAnd it is sad to see that a lot of \"critic reviews\" are willfully blind","Really a great game but I can't give ita positive rating until multiplayer is fixed. My boyfriend would ruin my island!","First of all, I understand that people have problems with the multiplayer. That should definitely be fixed, and it makes sense that people are upset. However, in my personal experience, this game is amazing.\r I basically live in Animal Crossing: New Horizons nowadays. It's a simple but fantastic game. The multiplayer is definitely flawed, but the rest of the game has so much content and has so much to do at all times. It's basically Animal Crossing, but in a completely different setting and with crafting, which makes it so much more interesting than the older games. The multiplayer is the only flaw that really affects what I think of the game, and the rest of it is fine-tuned to perfection.","I made a Metacritic account exclusively to support this wonderful game that so many people seem to misunderstand. Animal Crossing has always been a game where the first person to play has the most control, it has always been the intention to only have one town per console (despite being able to circumvent that in some of the installments), and most importantly, it has NEVER been about \"Progressing the Game\".\r Animal Crossing is a virtual playground where you hang out and customize your house, make friends with villagers, fill the museum, and just generally waste time, NOT  get to the next objective. If you can't appreciate a game without clear goals, this isn't the game for you, and that really is okay.  But \"This experience didn't appeal to me personally\" doesn't equate to a 1 or 0 score from an objective standpoint.\r The things you can do as Resident Advisor are completely ancillary to the core experience of Animal Crossing as a whole, and if you really can't tolerate asking whoever you share your ENTIRE SWITCH CONSOLE with to share their island with you, maybe you even have to talk to them every couple of days (God forbid) about building a bridge or whatever you are so desperately missing about being Player 1, then guess what? You WILL have to pay the same premium everybody else does to get the same experience.\r To cap this off, a HUGE shoutout to people who didn't like the one island system and gave it a fair, measured score based on an incredible game having one thing you personally don't like about it, i.e. 4-6, even a 3 if you just don't like the game. You're the real heroes.","I never played the original version but got both the one on the 3ds and Wii I loved both. This is a great improvement on those game bring new mechanics to the game we all have loved.

I have to stop playing until this gets fixed.","Multiplayer system is **** Literally no clue who thought this design choice was something players would enjoy.

We don\u2019t need a second switch since we are adults with full time jobs and don\u2019t play enough to warrant a second switch. Sharing an island is not the worst thing but waiting years to find this out was quite a disappointment. We have a PS4 and have separate accounts with separate save files. Why can\u2019t Nintendo do the same!?!?","My wife was super excited to play this game although it's not necessarily my style of game.  She prompted me to start a character first because she was busy the day we got it. And then when she went to start a character later we discovered that only one island may be played per console and that she would have to play based off my sloppy seconds. This just feels so wrong and a gross attempt to get the players to spend more money. My wife barely plays games and we were so turned off by this that we're going to return the game.  Awful representation by nintendo and a stain on their brand in my mind","The main issue people will direct at this game is the \"same-console multiplayer\" debacle. It isn't a huge issue in my eyes, it's not exactly like offering multiple saves was a series tradition or anything. To me, the main issue plaguing Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the endless tedium and monotonous gameplay that gets excused by the series \"take it easy, relax, no pressure\" conceit. Well, I'd like to relax, but the inordinate time spent between menus, the minuscule inventory, and the lack of meaningful improvements over previous entries is getting in the way.","my sister and I didn't knew about the one island, I started the game first. and now shes angry at me. we don't want to play together, and the fact that Nintendo is so greedy to try and use this method to make us by a second switch is unforgivable. \"having fun? want another person in your house to have fun to? buy another expansive product.\" they should change it asap.","the secondary account simply cannot progress in the game, the second account cannot build anything, all that we can do is build small items and walk around","I got the game as a birthday gift but let my sister play too as she had long wanted to play this game.

Multiplayer is worse than I could imagine. It's not just poorly done, it's deliberately broken as a design decision. It's mind boggling. And if you don't like it, you can't even have two users with their own single player game. I got it for two of us, but now I don't play because there's only so much that can be done in a real-world day. One player can use it up. And (this is more a switch complaint) if a user wants to invite a friend to play, that user needs their own nintendo online subscription. I can't just buy an individual plan for my console, I have to buy a damned family plan... for one console. All of the issues could be trivially fixed, but doing it this way was a deliberate design choice. It pisses me off.","This is a beautifully made game with hours to enjoy, but unfortunately Nintendo took this awesome game and used it to try and boost their switch sales by forcing households who only have one switch to buy Multiple.If you are the first person you get to experience everything the game has to offer.

You can get new villagers, Build stores, paths, bridges, and even change the landscape to truly make the island yours.If you are the second person to play on the console, you get to experience one aspect of Animal Crossing. You get to make a cool house. That's it. You cannot get new villagers to the island and you can't build bridges or paths. You might as well be playing as another Animal who takes up residence on the island. It isn't your island, you are just a guest.The fact that Nintendo consciously made the decision to force households to buy multiple consoles if everyone in the household wants to experience all this new game has to offer shows exactly how greedy the company has gotten.Yes I am fully aware that, as a company, they want to pull in as much profit as possible, but all this decision has done is made consumers angry and against the idea of giving them more money to feed their greed.Great Job creating a wonderful game and ruining it with your greed Nintendo.","This game doesn't deserve its high review score as it is unplayable for anyone with more than one user per system.\rThe game doesn not, I repeat, DOES NOT allow for individual save states.

I bought it, I let her play first she made an island and played for a bit. Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do. So, if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game, you need two switches. Worst decision I have ever seen, this even beats EA.\rCongratulations Nintendo, you have officially become the worst video game company this year!","I own the game. If your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, brother, dad, anyone launches and starts the game before you, say goodbye to your progress. You cannot or contribute to the progression of the island, as only the Representative of the Island (the first player running and playing the game) needs to unlock the features. Besides that, I just discovered certain feature that I can't have and only first player has received, which ruined this game for me, the one that buyed and proposed the game at home. Such a disappointment. You have been warned.","This game is beautiful and plays very good. BUT here is the deal: I started playing at launch, my girlfriend started to play the day after and was having fun until we realized that she couldn't proceed in the game unless I proceeded in the game. Me, as player 1 was the real character and she was just a NPC that you can play as which completely sucks. She love the franchise but can't afford a Switch but with this, Nintendo is basically saying \"Hey, do you wanna play Animal Crossing as it should be played? GET ANOTHER SWITCH YOU LITTLE *******!\". I'm really unsatisfied and even though I liked the game, this completely ruined it for me. Animal crossing should be a game that you go and relax, not a game that you play angry because only YOU can build the bridge or the store or something relevant.\rNew horizons is far more disappointing than Pokemon Sword/Shield, because it looks like Nintendo is becoming an EA.","I love this game with a passion and I am so glad it is finally back! Almost everything about the game is amazing. I said almost.

There's clearly a decent game in there but it's completely ruined by a clumsy local multiplayer system that involves one player being the 'leader' and the other player being utterly worthless. The game allows you to switch leader on the fly but the whole thing just becomes a confusing mess. \"Who is the leader? Oh, you are. Let's switch so I can pick up this item. Okay. Now let's switch back so can open my inventory and give you this other item. Okay, you've picked it up. No, wait, you weren't the leader. That item's now been sent to the chest by Tom Nook for no apparent reason. Right, well we'll have to waste time heading back over there in a minute. But first I want to do some stuff at my house. I'll need to be leader for that and you'll need to sit and wait for a few minutes doing nothing. You know what, just forget it actually... This isn't fun.\"The worst part is that this is clearly all in place as a ploy to get you to buy a second Switch and two copies of the game. The whole thing stinks of greed and I've lost a ton of respect for Nintendo as a result of this.If you're playing on your own and you're into these kind of games then there's probably a good time to be had. If your main reason for buying the game is to play locally with a friend or partner then don't waste your money.","I love everything about this game except for the fact that it\u2019s limited to one island per game. This becomes a pain when you\u2019re sharing with your family. Nintendo, I have been playing your games for as long as I can remember, but unfortunately my experience with Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been completely ruined because of your one business move. Not everyone has the time and money to buy multiple consoles for a single game. Please, Nintendo, allow users on the same switch to have different islands. I would happily change my rating to a 10 if this were the case. Your goal should be to keep the ENTIRE community happy.","As others have said, unplayable and absolutely terrible multiplayer.  We have 3 young kids, and the level of frustration is enormous.  Until this is fixed, if you are buying for a family with multiple kids, you must avoid at all costs.","It\u2019s sh*t that you can\u2019t have your own island if you share a switch.    .","One island per console is just too greedy even for NintEAndo! Until this gets fixed I can't rate it any higher.","Multiple kids cannot play this at the same time in split screen on one TV one switch.  Absolutely unacceptable!  Now I have kids fighting over a shared resource.For how expensive the switch and the Nintendo online account and the game was not acceptable seriously this should allow two or three or four kids to play at the same time.","Best Animal crossing in history, the game is beautyful and especially now in Times of corona this game is needed","Our household was so excited to get this game as we have played every other version of animal crossing and love the world of animal crossing. However upon learning only one person actually gets to experience the full game per switch and that there\u2019s no option to create your own island even with a separate game purchase ruined the experience. While it\u2019s fun and cute and new features like the Nook phone and mileage add to gameplay, the gameplay for \u201cplayer 2\u201d is severely restricted. Additional players are limited to what \u201cplayer 1\u201d has achieved, and only player 1 can advance gameplay by achieving goals to upgrade Nook\u2019s shop or the museum. Additional players also do not get to invite new animal residents or choose where to build houses and buildings, nor do they have access to the same resources and quests as player 1. This for me is a huge gray cloud that hangs over this otherwise cute and fun addition to the franchise. Nintendo - value your fans over selling more consoles","Nintendo has made it impossible for you to creat multiple islands on a single Switch console in a nasty attempt to get people to purchase more consoles. This completely ruins the game for me and many other long-time fans of the series.","Please please please fix the two player system. I was having so much fun playing this with my partner while we're in quarantine, but today he unlocked the housing construction project and as the second player there is literally no way for me to access the 18 new DIY recipes. I am left out of everything in my own life, and now I'm left out of a stupid game too.","Horrible for poor kids. Me and my little brother share a switch (technically mine, I paid for it and all the games) He uses it when I'm at work or sleeping. I heard of animal crossing though a friend, said it was a calm way to spend quarantine. Never played before, but the hype got me excited. I didn't know what to expect,  I haven't played before.I played for about in hour or two then let my bro on, only to see he couldn't play. 69+ dollars and a second person couldn't even play. I can't get another switch and a second copy, I get my stuff with a part time job, and my brother is only 11.  My parents have jobs that get them though paycheck to paycheck so asking them to lay down 400+ dollars is ridiculous. Obviously Nintendo doesn't care for their poor families, if I knew this is the way the game functioned I would have saved my money.","This game is really well made and deserve to be played, I love every detail but I wish you could do something more in the online multiplayer","It's insane to expect us to buy two switches just to actually play multiplayer, especially when you could fully play it all the way back on the GameCube. Allow either a second save file or allow us to choose how much control a second player gets. All the way up to and including placing major buildings and getting all diy projects.","Seeing as Nintendo decided to completely screw up bug spawn rates and nerf the interest rate instead of patching in much needed Quality of Life updates, I am left with little to no enjoyment of this game. At this point, I only play out of obligation and I'm astonished with how they released this in the state that it's in. It is abundantly clear that New Horizons was released in an unfinished state, seeing as there are straight up omissions of features and items that were in New Leaf, and plenty of rookie mistakes that seriously should've been spotted in the testing phase but were left unfixed. Such as the lack of bulk crafting, ability to take materials from storage while crafting, the list goes on.\r When there is a fanmade video that shows the kind of QoL changes that could be in this game, you know that the devs did not take the time to fine-tune the game before release. I'm aware a lot of people are glad the game is out with current world events happening as of now, but that should never excuse that the game has problems that should be addressed and that the players should at least be notified that there will be some kind of QoL update down the line. Instead, they go and just screw with the bug spawn rates, just making it harder for people to catch them for no good reason; and even go around and heavily reduce the interest rate to only a maximum of 9,999 bells. Something which was not needed in the slightest and it's an enigma of how they thought that was okay to even consider.\r Not to mention the multiplayer is a complete joke when sharing a console with others and online multiplayer is just as bad with mounds of text form Orville to just connect online and even then, Nintendo's netcode is still just as lousy as always.\r All in all, Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game that has massive potential, but is held back by a tidal wave of problems and lack of QoL from releasing unfinished. As such, this is the worst game in the series, and I cannot in good faith recommend this game which sucks coming from someone who adores this series and just wants to see the best for it and this new entry. Hopefully, later updates address and fix the myriad of problems and turn New Horizons into the worthy entry that it should be.","One island per console... i dont know why nintendo would do that its dumb and doesnt let a familly share the game, if they fix this ill fix my review but for now they deserve 0","Super jeux familiales !

Just enjoy Healing time. 0 point giver is too bad.","I like the design and new aesthetics of the game, having played all the previous versions, and even though they've kept having 1 island/town throughout the series, it doesn't execute as properly as on a family console device like the switch.","Fantastic game that does everything a sequel should do, i.e. take everything great from the previous games and then add even more to it. A wonderfully chill game that anyone can enjoy at their own pace. My only complaints are the one save per switch, and you have to pay for the online service just to scan and use QR codes. Not a big deal for me personally but still disappointing. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10 in my book.","it is 2020. Multiplayer should be expansive and innovative, but it is boring af. You can only visit others' islands. You cannot cohabitate with anyone. I think you are forced to if you share one switch device, but you cannot live with someone who owns their own switch. This is r*t*rded. So stupid.\r I cleaned up my island and did significant upgrades in three days. After that, and even during, there is little to do. There are lots of tiny goals to knock out, but to minuscule reward. Grinding towards more upgrades feels pointless because the game starts with little to do, then you get a few upgrades. Is there more to do now? No. More to buy, maybe, but no injection of more activities. Just more fishing and shaking trees. Grind for more upgrades. Is there more to do, now? Not really. You can spend an extra 30 seconds a day now digging up fossils. That all.\r It's not really worth talking about. Or playing. Feels super lonely, and flying to others' islands to fish next to them doesn't make it better.\r Really disappointing.","Fantastic game if you play on your own Switch.

Short on cash, I had to choose between this and Pokemon, given the stellar reviews I gave it a go. I'm beating myself up over this. I just don't get the hype. It is NOT worth 60 bucks. It's a minuscule game, with very little to do, had I spent 20 bucks on it, I'd say I got my money's worth. But to think I could have got Pokemon for the same price!? I also don't get why time travel is a point of contention... Don't people get that the whole waiting game is just artificially bloating the experience by forcing you to grind, doing activities devoid of fun over and over again in the meantime. That's the kind of manoeuvres used in freemium  games on smartphones.","IGNORE BAD REVIEWS. the 1 island thing really isn't an issue. appears to be just a bunch of people new to the franchise and gaming in general who don't understand whats going on.","#DashReviews\r Intro\r Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the console follow up to the critical apprised portable outing, New Leaf. Nintendo has hit most Switch outing out of the part, so hoping the Animal Crossing would go leaps and bounds beyond previous titles is to be expected. While Nintendo mostly pulls this off, there are a few things that bring this title down.\r Story/World Building \u2013 3/3\r This topic a bit hard to talk about due to the nature of Animal Crossing. There is not much of a story so everything comes down to the world-building that is used through characterization and everything that happens within the world. Characters are varied and fun to interact with. You normally don\u2019t see the same dialog twice. You feel like you\u2019re having real conversations with neighbors that live next to you. Fleshed out characters help motivate you to keep building your island so all your virtual friends can have their best lives.\r Gameplay \u2013 2/4\r While there nothing inherently wrong with the gameplay, flaws start to show their ugly head once you start playing for a long period of time. Everything from fishing, collecting items to use for customization, crafting items, and shaping the world to your liking works well. The problems come in with the slow archaic menu system. It takes forever to craft items, selecting multiple of the same item, and talking to villagers for options. The option to fast skip text or being able to choose multiple of the same item would help tremendously. Online play is even more restrictive. It\u2019s fun to hang out with friends but you are locked out from almost everything you can do on your island when someone else is visiting. You even have to watch a 30-second cutscene every time someone comes or leaves your island, stopping you from whatever you were doing. I think everything else works well with new additions such as terraforming landscapes and crafting items, which are great additions but changing the menu systems would greatly improve the overall package.\r Technical/Performance \u2013 3/3\r Nintendo must have put a lot of time into the visual aspect of this game because for a game that focuses on cartoon looking animals, there are so many jaw-dropping models scattered throughout this game. Decorative items, fossils, fish, and bugs all look stunning. They mesh well with the cartoony aesthetic of the game and make it all the more satisfying to build your island. The soundtrack is pretty good albeit a bit repetitive at times. Nothing terrible but nothing outstanding. If there is one aspect that Nintendo is good at, it\u2019s the technical side of their games.\r Verdict\r Animal Crossing: New Horizons will please fans of the series while welcoming newcomers all the same. It\u2019s a fun game for all ages that don\u2019t mind playing a game with a slower pace. There is always room in the gaming market for a game like this but I would like to see menus be a bit more intuitive so I don\u2019t have to spend 2 hours doing something that should have taken half that time. I recommend a purchase at full price if you are a fan of this style of game. If you\u2019re not big on life simulation games or don\u2019t have the time to play, you can wait a while before picking this one up.","I'm genuinely in love with the Animal Crossing games. I've played every single one and have loved all of them. New Horizons is my favorite to date. This game opens up a lot of opportunities for new players and doesn't push old players away. The island is nice and big and has lots to do. The first couple of days of playing are relatively boring but as soon as you get passed them the game really opens up. I want to point out the fact that I am the only one in my entire family who plays video games so I have no experience with the only one player is the ruler, but I completely understand the frustration and I would be frustrated too. Hopefully, Nintendo fixes that in an update soon, but for that issue, I'm docking off one point. Honestly, this is a great game, I highly recommend it.","Most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't understand what they were getting or didn't give the game enough time to see how it shapes up after some time.\r Yes, it's true you can only have one island per console. This has always been how Animal Crossing games work where multiple users share a town. It allows you to talk to the same NPCs, contribute collectively to the museum, etc. so that you share the experience with your household, rather than having disparate experiences on different saves. It's how the game is supposed to be played, and I dare say it is better for it. My siblings and I shared a town in the original AC as a kid and one of the best parts was hiding items for others to find, talking about the villagers, and visiting each others' houses. None of this would be possible if each player had their own island on a single system.\r It's also true that there are some things which only the first player can do... This feels arbitrary and actually is a bit of a bummer. I assume Nintendo did this for narrative reasons, and so that adults playing with their kids wouldn't have to live with their child's \"poor decisions\" or something like that... But as I said, it does feel a bit unnecessary and evokes more negative emotions than positive ones, so I don't think this was a very smart design decision. Still, the impact of these is actually pretty minimal in the grand scheme of the game, as becomes more apparent the longer you play. Some people evidently did not play long enough and just posted their immediate gut reaction.\r The slow pace of the game is not for everyone, but oddly most of the reviews here don't even touch on that. You should approach Animal Crossing a bit more like the Sims than your typical game; that is, the goals are mainly to do basic life tasks, decorate, and talk to people. It's much more driven by self-narrative, and your ability to enjoy it is going to depend on your own imagination and willingness to buy into the game world.\r Once you get past the initial cluelessness of wondering what you're supposed to be doing, you realize there is a lot to do and the answer is \"whatever you feel like\". Fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, coordinating outfits, arranging trees... It's all part of the experience, but the game does not force you to do one particular thing. New Horizons specifically adds some nice touches with the ability to place furniture outside, storage inside your house, etc. which are a sweet improvement over previous installments, and in a lot of ways make this the best Animal Crossing yet.\r There are minor things I wish they did differently. For instance, I would like to mail things to friends before I visit their island, but I understand why that isn't an option. (Traditionally in AC games, you can only send letters to villagers after you have spoken with them directly. So they applied the same logic to real players.) It would be nice if the shared-screen co-op allowed you to do things like travel together or open both players' inventories. (The system in place has a leader and a follower, where the follower is restricted in what they can do... But you can switch who the leader is very quickly if need be.) All of these things are rather petty in the grand scheme of things, though.\r The game is fantastic and has a wide array of content, with evidence of much more on its way. We have already gotten a pretty beefy patch and a few events, so it seems like Nintendo is committed to regular updates at least for another year+, given its popularity. You could see some of the complaints become irrelevant due to future updates, or they may just pack in a bunch more content. Either way, the updates are really the cherry on top of a game that is easily one of the best of the year. Don't listen to the complainers.\r By the way, it's perfectly fine to play this game solo, too. ;) Reviews shouldn't be so heavily weighted on the multiplayer experience only.","The inclusion of only 1 island per console frustrates me, I was excited for this game, but because I can't even start my own island, what's the point?","So I previously had a very positive review here. I really enjoyed the first week of the game and it is still pretty good. However, the more you'll play the more basic and uninteresting everything becomes. Characters have not a lot of things to say and they'll even repeat the same line for a few days in a row. To be honest it makes the game feel generic and while the in other games the villagers felt like real people, hre it feels like they are just basic NPCs. For me, this was my favorite part of New Leaf so that is why I edited this one. If you only buy this for the building part. Then buy it. It does that part very well, but if you want an Animal Crossing game with villagers that feel alive. I suggest you buy any of the other games.","It's a great game despite its flaws... The attention to detail, the music and the overall presentation is great, as are most of the gameplay mechanics. If you want two islands on the same switch, don't buy it. If you want a chilled out life SIM then there's nothing else that comes close to it on the Switch.","Tengo que admitir que es un juego adictivo, nunca hab\u00eda jugado animal crossing, pero si juegos parecidos, y la verdad me encanta, el estilo visual si no es el mejor pero a la vista de verdad te encanta, la manera en que funciona estoy pegado a el todos los d\u00edas, es un juegazo para los que les gusta este genero lo recomiendo","This was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and I must say all my hype and excitement was very much matched. The atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation, a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want. Catching fish, planting flowers, visiting new places, a museum, and shopping, all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane, to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all, not that it'll stop me from trying! Then the social element with friends makes the experience even better, as the communication with hunting bugs and fish, different stuff to craft, or even the \"stalk market\" all make you feel like you're apart of something larger as a whole (even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you). That's exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise, and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us. And even simplified, visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun! (So long as everyone plays nice)\r This was a time in my life when this game was exactly needed, and has brought me so much joy and peace. I know I'll be playing this game for months and years to come, and even when the next Animal Crossing game comes out, New Horizons will always hold a special place in my heart for being my entry into this beautiful series.","Honestly, I'm not qualified to review this game as I never do this. It is true 1 island per console is really disappointing but not surprising from nintendo. I have never played AC before this game, and I used to hate on this game but now that I've played it, I can't stop. This game doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. It's a great, fun and addicting game anyone can play and have fun with.","Such a wonderful game, I don\u2019t play animal crossing for the multiplayer, my wife and I have our own switches and have tons of fun visiting each other\u2019s islands and trading different things we\u2019ve found for each other. I highly recommend this game, don\u2019t trust the salty reviews.","\"I can't read and/or am uninformed, better review-bomb a game and give it a 0, regardless of actual experience with gameplay\" -average ACNH reviewer.\r To get this out of the way: Yes, one island per device is frustrating, but we knew this and this has been the case for every animal crossing game. This information was announced by Nintendo, has been covered in the media and is explicitly mentioned in the Nintendo E-shop and on the box for physical copies. Review-bombing a game out of ignorance is rather pathetic and it's sad to see such an extremely misleading user score, which hardly reflects the game, merely the frustration of angry fans that didn't bother to read or inform themselves.\r As for the actual game, it's hardly a secret at this point that it's a stellar game. Arguably one of the best life simulators and in terms of visuals, gameplay and overall feel, absolutely an upgrade over older games. It's a fantastic experience, a perfect game to just relax with and, unless you're a so-called \"time traveler\", a game that will last you for years to come due to absolute tons of customization and options not present in earlier titles.\r However, not all is perfect and there are a few points of critique I have, mostly when comparing to older games, most of which boil down to missing content. Nintendo's approach to this game is to periodically add updates including new content, which is exciting, but creates uncertainty. Stuff like swimming, the cafe, club LOL, the dream suite etc. all seem to be missing from the game and while obviously not a necessity, I believe many fans would like to see their return or at least an equivalent substitute for some of the features unlocked by some of these facilities. These may be added in future updates, seeing how datamines include placeholders for a museum cafe and even gyroids, but what else will be added remains to be seen.\r In general, the game is absolutely solid and feels more accessible than ever, as well as being released during a lockdown, assuring tons of hours of fun during these boring times. Everyone can enjoy it- (as long as they each have their own Switch...) and is a top recommendation for any Switch owner. Strong 8-9 from me, depending on future content to be added.","Only reviewing this now because I have not stopped playing this game. I will be playing this for YEARS. Im actually having more fun with this game then I did Pokemon and I played Pokemon A LOT. Not full of action like Astral Chain or Bayonetta but wow, it's just always brings a smile to my face to wake up every morning, explore my island, catch bugs, fish, gather, talk to villagers, visit friends online, etc. So much fun and perfect for quarantine time. Definitely get this if you have Switch.","Oi stop **** review bombing the **** game you dumbasses haven't even played it yet","I've never played an Animal Crossing before and I can't stop playing it now! Amazing! there are lots of things to do! The characters are all charming, you can visit other islands, customize everything...It's a infinit game.

Everyone rating the game a 0-4 because they can\u2019t have multiple users isn\u2019t fair! Get off here! And cry somewhere else. What\u2019s the big deal?

The game is unbelievable good and adorable!","Game of all type of people. I'm 34 and can't stop playing this game. A lot of enjoy!","Adore this game, cannot put it down. However can be frustrating because it can be incredibly slow, especially at the start. Also the one island per console is dumb. But I still love it!","They cut Everything out of the Game, all past shops, features, many of the house upgrades, the original Animal Crossing you could have 15 villagers, here only 10. The Islands feel small and cramped, villagers don't really do side quests any more,no Diving, no Multiplayer mini games, All users on a single consoleMust share the same tiny island. Less plants, Only two shops I'm the game with Books Cranny only having one upgrade, the Island editor is slow and limited, custom paths can still be kicked off the ground, no daily or monthly events, loading times that shouldn't exist. Besides Graphics this is the worst entry in the series. I could go on even more if I wanted.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great SINGLE player game. The game was HEAVILY advertised as a multiplayer game for the whole family which isn\u2019t the case. One player picks the island, names the island, and overall has the better experience. But I don\u2019t understand the harsh feedback. This game\u2019s \u201cisland sharing functionality\u201d isn\u2019t any different from previous titles in the franchise. I understand the frustration but I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s being review bombed for this reason alone.","Absolutely incredible game that not only makes me feel a little less lonely, but also allow me to have genuine interactions, going back and forth between islands and helping each other out, with my best friend, who is two continents over, in these scary times. It's an incredible game and I have been adoring every second of it. It's a polished, smooth experience and it's pretty darned close to perfect!","**** piece of **** stupid **** one island mechanic. You can only have one Island at a time, and the second player gets to do nothing. **** you Nintendo.\r 9/10","This is a great relaxing game. I love it. It is the perfect game to play while listening to podcasts or watching TV with family. I could see why it would be frustrating if you were playing with someone else on the same console though- which is why I took off a point.","Where do I even begin with this game? Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first Animal Crossing title I have ever played and I am loving every bit of it. I used to be one to shy away from the series because I felt it wasn't a game for me, but boy was I wrong. Everything about the game is exciting and there's so much to do every new day you boot the game up. You start the game off as a Villager brought to a deserted island with Tom Nook and a couple other of animal villagers. Right off the bat, you're assigned with tasks to keep you busy for the rest of the day. From fishing, catching bugs, gathering materials, crafting items, and expanding the village, there's a lot to do on such a little island. This game couldn't have come out at a better time especially due to the current state of affairs, but it is a game that has had me occupied since the day it came out! Visiting other friends' islands is just as fun and it's really unexplainable how great this game is. It's truly an experience everyone should enjoy.","The game is absolutely fantastic and everything we have been waiting for for seven long years. The ability to truly customize your island and all of the quality of life upgrade make this game so very worth the money. It\u2019s a slow relaxing game that any fan of past Animal Crossing games would love.","This game is the best in the series by far but the multiplayer is a problem. I do believe that it should be one island per cartridge at the least and not one island per switch. Don't even bother with the local multiplayer. Other than that this game is near perfect.","Loving it so far. My husband and I are playing together. Admittedly we were a bit stumped at first about only having one island but it's been fun anyway. We keep leaving each other gifts and sending cute mail. It's probably the most romantic we've been in a bit lol. Still a little confused about how you play online with friends. I want to visit their islands but I think that might cost extra and that is a little shady. But the gameplay is super relaxing and enjoyable. The customization options are awesome. It's so cute. I'm honestly spending way more time on it than I expected. A little obsessed lol.","Totally unfair that users are slamming this game with a 0/10 review for the 1-island-per-console issue. Yes, it really does suck. It\u2019s a pain and it does somewhat diminish the enjoyment of the game. BUT there are so many amazing facets of the game! The detail, the nook miles system, the nook phone, the creative ways they snuck in old themes (Dodo Airlines in place of Tortimer!) \u2014 they are worth at least a few points! don\u2019t drag down a beautiful game with a 0/10 rating for one issue, even if it is worth the loss of a couple points.","The game is utterly fantastic. With the core functions of the old games and the new functions added in, the game is a brilliant blend of nostalgia and a breath of fresh air. Animal Crossing continues to be a relaxing experience for the player and maintains its charm in New Horizons. It's nice to have a new spin on the things we're used to seeing from an Animal Crossing game.\r In regards to those reviews being left that are upset about there only being one island per console, I share this. From Nintendo themselves on the official Animal Crossing New Horizons website: \"Up to eight Nintendo Account holders can live on the same island within each game. With one Nintendo Switch system and one game, up to four of those Nintendo Account holders can play on the same island at the same time (additional accessories required). With additional systems and games, up to eight players can play on the same island at the same time via local wireless or online play. Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features.\"\r This was clearly stated before the player even purchased the game. This is the way that animal crossing has always been. 1 island per console. The fact that you are even able to have multiple villagers from the same console playing together on the island at the same time is unique to this game only in the series. And they've actually upped this from the typical 4 villagers living in one town to now 8 villagers living on one island, allowing larger families to have unique villagers for each family member. Why would you have multiple islands to choose from on a game that has historically only ever had one town per console, regardless of the type of system the player is using? Playing on a family Wii console with City Folk? One town. Playing on a personal handheld console with Wild World or New Leaf? One town. Just read the information on the game functionality before you buy a game. The game is great all around and is one for the books, just remember to read what the game-play is before you purchase a game.","A very cute and refreshing Animal Crossing game. It offers beautiful graphics and motivation through \"setting your own goals\", especially with the Nook Miles. Offers many improvements like the tool ring.The only thing I need to complain is the long \"tutorial phase\". It could be a little bit boring and during this time, you'll hear the same bgm. Also I have the feeling the animal villagers are a little bit dull and are annoyed very fast.And there are some things I'm missing like the cafe. I hope they'll improve (villagers dialogues) and add those things in an update.In overall, it's a lovely new Animal Crossing with some flaws. It was worth the long wait. I don't understand the negative review bomb. It was known for a long time that you can have one island per console. //shrug","From a single player standpoint, this game is amazing. It has lovely graphics, as well as being jam packed full of content. The only reason this isn't getting a perfect score is because of the 1 island per console rule. I play with my sister, and I was the one who started the island. After watching her play for a bit, It was clear how the game satisfaction to both players were very different. She didn't get to decide where structures such as houses or shops would be placed, and it was a bit confusing at first to figure out how she could get the recipes that I had already learned by completing missions such as donating to Tom Nook. This leads me to my next point, which is how player two wont get as much satisfaction from the game as player one would, whereas player one had to complete an objective to gain an important tool crafting recipe, which has a sense of reward, while player two would have the recipe appear in the shop, not having to work for it. If Nintendo had added the feature of being able to have multiple islands per console, there would be no question that Animal Crossing New Horizons would get that perfect 10/10 from almost everyone.","Brilliant game! Relaxing, fun, and just sweet. The new additions of Nook Miles and crafting are nice, but it's very much still the same charm as the old animal crossing games. Only flaws are that it isnt clear that you have to open your island up for people to be able to visit, and that you can  only have one island per switch console - only major problem for me! Otherwise, fantastic!","I love this game so much! Sad to see some sad person review bombing Animal Crossing: New Horizons because you can't have more than 1 island on your switch.","Awesome game!!!!! it is an infinite game with innumerable innovations and with an incredible gameplay","Great game with a great pace and lots of new features to expand on its New Leaf success.","Love the game. I\u2019m sure Nintendo has their reasons why they only allow 1 island per switch. Get over it. Game is perfect.","My first Animal Crossing game and it has been an absolute blast to play this. Great job Nintendo! Having one island is great and never would have wanted more!","I just start the game three days ago... Well, that's what my Switch says, I actually can't remember when I started, just can't stop playing. You always have something to do and if you don't, just stop playing and continue another time of the day, things change. I'm loving this game, my first Animal Crossing, never played one before.","A true return to form, the game introduces a plethora of QoL changes and mechanics to make the island life more engaging and satisfying compared to some previous titles. For the uninitiated the game may be an excellent starting point.","Excellent game, best installment in the series by far! I noticed a lot of idiots who apparently never played an animal crossing game before are reviewbombing here. Let me enlighten you on the fact that \u201cone island/town per console\u201d has been a thing since the first Animal crossing on the GameCube. No, it\u2019s not a feature that\u2019s been removed from the game or anything, it\u2019s the animal crossing standard that it\u2019s player one\u2019s world and everyone else lives in it.  Don\u2019t be a cuck and let your wife or kids be player one if you\u2019re that hardcore into this E-rated game, and don\u2019t reviewbomb a family game as a grown ass adult complaining that you\u2019re stuck on player 2 and have a hard time sharing with people lol.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game and something different from the other games from this franchise in the past. It saved the AC games from the mobile ones that they were producing and provides a great story. The game isn't perfect but is enjoyable to play. These are some things I think they might need to work on possibly adding. 1.) Villagers need more life to them like in other games, I think having quests to do from them would be a great way to have a bond with your villagers. 2.) I know this is what a lot of people are saying but, have more than 1 account for a switch; you could even make it to where it only can be another Nintendo ID to have another island. 3.) The online cut scene for a player arriving to your island is dreadful to watch, at first its cool but then after a while of having to watch it, it is tedious and annoying; especially if you constantly have people joining and leaving. A simple solution could be to have a button to skip or just not have it ( If possible). 4.) More interaction with items, this one could be a simple update to make more of the items have a better interaction with it, such as the Tea-Cups that spin. The game would become more fun and make players want the items more if they have something to do with them other than just for decoration. These are some of the changes I think Nintendo could apply to Animal Crossing New Horizons to make the game more enjoyable than it already is.","I see that most of the bad reviews are of the multiplayer aspect of the game and I can understand where they are coming from.\r However, this game has been fun as hell for me and Im going to rate on my own personal experience.\r The game is a fun time and ultimately relaxing. It came out at the perfect time.","Reggie really outdid himself this time.\rIt's fun.\rIt's really fun.\r10/5 can't wait for the sequel","Really spectacular game. Lots of detail and charm. Perfect for relaxing, the hourly music is so nice.","I wasn't even planning on getting this game, but they have improved the series so much with this iteration that I picked it up anyways. Now I spend at least a few hours a day on my island. One of the biggest improvements I've found is that it seems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game, so you are more likely to get items that match the aesthetic or set that you are trying to pull together for your house. Maybe I have just gotten lucky, but when I got the game I noticed a lot of other people had really tightly designed spaces that looked great already despite how new the game is. In previous titles I had little incentive to upgrade my house for a while because of how hard it was to get the furniture and items I wanted in the store. Now I am already grinding bells to get more space. The crafting and customization mechanics are also a great improvement, and while tools that break can be a pain, it's a lot less painful to have to drop a flimsy tool to make room for resources than the normal tools in other games. I can't wait to see what else ACNH has in store, and what will come with new content!","This game is too fun. (Think I might be addicted.) With everything going on right now this game provides a great escape. If you want to get into the animal crossing series play this one. You will not be disappointed.","I Don't understand the High Volume of negative reviews here, the game is amazing. So much to do, see and mess around with. Great game if you have time (like right now) so please, play it. I spent hours just fishing, yeah, straight fishing. There's more to do though, give it a shot. Don't watch a lets play, it looks boring on that, you have to play it first.","This is a beautiful reincarnation of the Animal Crossing Series. I'm gonna be coming back all year to make sure I fill out my museum. This game makes it incredibly simple to join up with my friends too, offering an in game texting tool so I can hit them up to visit my island if I see them on. Tools break annoyingly often though...\r I will say I got my own switch and am the only player on my island. I understand the people that have been negatively impacted by the one island feature and I regret that.\r As for me, I love it! 10/10","It is so incredibly relaxing compared to many games but it is not without flaws. Its simplicity can also cause understandable polarisation in reviews. If 'impatient', 'action-hungry' or 'likes-to-skip-cutscenes' describes you at all, you will not enjoy this game. At times the dialogue and real-time day progression system will test you but giving it a chance and taking it slow will yield undeniably cute moments worth your waiting. If you plan to play more than one person per switch drop this review score by 3 points (I never liked Nintendo's insistence on having ten consoles and copies of the game for per gaming family)","I love this game! Every day i play his and i am trying to get 2 of my hated vilagers out! I can terraform and make the perfect island! I can breed flowers are much more! This game is a must have!","The perfect game to these times. It ia relaxing and social challenge with many Things to do","Most of the negative reviews here are about console/island limitations. Imagine being poor hahahahaha just buy another switch. Imagine coming to bomb a review page and blame a game because YOU cannot afford your own console. 10/10 Game of the Year.","Animal crossing new horizons is amazing and has tons to do, this game is one of my favorite games.\rI can't stop playing this game. There is one problem that is easy for me to ignore but you can only have 1 island per console. Other than that is game is amazing.\r Categories:\rgraphics: 10/10\rgame play: 9/10\rcouch co-op: 3/10\rraplayability: 10/10","Really chill game that lets you do whatever feels like it could relieve your stress. With a wonderful atmosphere and adorable aesthetics you can enjoy your own life on a deserted island. This was the first animal crossing game I bought and I honestly did not see the appeal before. After playing I can finally say that seeing your island life progress with new animal friends and your own creativity shine to show for others or simply for yourself is a fun thing. I have not even started to play with friends yet but I can imagine that will make the game even more enjoyable.","Don't listen to these garbage user reviews complaining about the same one problem over and over again.  One island really isn't bad.  Also, giving the game a bad review for having no multiplayer progression is just as bad.  The solo experience is well worth it.  You should look at this game for what it is in total.  Animal Crossing:  New Horizons is a very enjoyable life sim.  It could even be called the greatest Animal Crossing game out there.  The basic principles in this game are the same as the other games.  You pay off debt, do daily tasks, get villagers, catch bugs, and all the rest.  Like in New Leaf, you can make stuff like bridges and ramps.  However, New Horizons adds new customization to your island.  In this game, you can move buildings around and decide where all of the buildings get built.  Crafting is new, and it is a very nice addition.  You can only craft one item at a time, which sucks, but having the ability to make stuff is a welcome feature.  This game is amazing, and you will spend hundreds of hours into it without realizing it.  So don't listen to the 5.2 user score on this website;  It's the result of a bunch of angry people bringing a great game down for a petty reason.  This game is fun, relaxing, charming, and just overall a good time.  Give this game a shot, and I'm sure you'll love it.","Me encanto el juevo voy dias jugandolo y se ve que tiene para rato vale la pena comprarlo te dara dias y meses de diversion","only one real save-game is possible per switch... makes sense from a business point of view ($$$$) - unacceptable for customers.","Despite everyone here talking about how \"The first player is the main one\" principle is bad and ruins fun, I actually kinda see, what Nintendo intended with it(through I don't think it fully works), every other player has to ask first one, if they want new bridge, move some house and e.t.c and raise money together for it. I'm playing with my brother with me as the first player and he doesn't find that too problematic","Adorable and fun, this game is not for players looking for constant action. It's a very relaxing and slow-paced game. A big step forward for the animal crossing series!","Awesome game, fantastic visuals and a very calming aesthetic. It makes for the perfect Saturday evening.","Great game, I have to admit that the one island per switch isn't the best, but it's not that big of a deal as I'm the main person to play on it, but it would be nice to at least have the option to.","It's very fun and relaxing. I enjoy the many ways to customize my player character, and the island I live on.","Basically it is a really good game. The fact that it\u2019s shared on console is a tiny factor of negativity in a great game. It builds on previous editions of the game, not tearing it down. People need to find a hobby other than wantonly down voting something for no reason. The people with legit concerns, like the shared console issues, are perfectly understandable. Especially if you have children in your home that do whatever they want. Or the people who want their own island. Regardless, the game is still good. If you liked the other games, I cannot see a reason for why you would t like this one, other than the said console issues. Idk. People suck and honestly I would rather communicate with animal people pixels than some of the real life people running around today.","It's a great game that will give you hundreds and thousands of hours, the beginning feels slow, and your island feels lonely and empty, but little by little, you'll start to fill it to the brand with furniture, plants, fences... It is pure positive feelings. Don't look at the 0s, they are part of the usual review-bombing","El mejor Animal Crossing que han hecho hasta ahora, con multitud de posibilidades y con contenido nuevo durante 3 a\u00f1os (por lo menos)","This game is phenomenal. It's one of the prettiest games I've ever played, and is such a fun time. It's a game about progression and improvement over time. It's so much fun to just pick up for 20 minutes and do the daily jobs. I like to watch all my villagers interact with the environment and each other, and learn more about them as characters.","Great game stop review bombing!!!..................................................................","Wonderful game that you really get sucked into! Honestly nintendo came out with this game at the perfect time.","Awesome Game.Fant\u00e1stico para jugar un par de horas diarias. Muy recomendable","A wide improvement over all the other installments. And they even let you bring in the cards from the tragic wii u party game.","I've put about 250 hours in at this point and I still don't see a day coming where I don't check my island. This is my first Animal Crossing game and so far in having a blast. Starting out with a desolate nothing island and building it up to an metropolis has been the best thing while stuck at home.","I absolutely love this game. It is such a good distraction from what is going on in the world right now. The instant serotonin I get from New Horizons is a dependable joy every day. All of the negative reviews I've read don't seem to understand how the game fundamentally works. It is almost only a single player game, and you can link up with friends and visit each others' islands. So maybe don't buy it if you're only looking for a game your entire family can play at once on one console. But do buy it if you're missing your friends; this is a great way to still hang out while socially distancing.","Its a great game, I enjoyed too much i play every day and its a pretty nice game","This game is tricky to rate.  8/10 if you are the first player on your island and resident rep.  But if you aren\u2019t, then you are nothing more than a glorified NPC.  You can\u2019t progress your island whatsoever and with only one island allowed per switch you have no possible way of actually playing the game.","Where to start...\rI'd never played an animal crossing game, and everyone I knew raved about them so I thought, hey, we're under lockdown, a nice relaxing game is perfect... I personally don't have a problem with the one island per console as I'm the sole user.\r Pros:\rIt's quirky and cute and engaging and there are so many things to make.\rThe time of year events are a nice touch, but could be more interesting\r Cons:\rMost DIY items, shopping items etc are the equivalent of the amazon deals page; a few nice items but 95% plastic tat. I understand the aim of the game is to fill your island with consumer goods to raise it's 'rating' but it really just feels like someone raided the unity asset store for free models; very few things are aesthetically pleasing.\r Interactions, menus, inventory etc feel unintuitive (to me);\ri) 'drop' should not be the top item on the inventory menu.\rii) I want to be able to shake a tree for fruit even if I'm holding a spade without it trying to (ineffectively) dig up the tree.\riii) Many sub menu interactions kick you out of the whole menu/inventory after doing one thing, e.g. unequip a hat, and if you want to do anything else (unequip more etc) back into the inventory you go.\r Dialogs/Messageboxes are WAY too verbose and always on; most games with chat dialog may have a verbose version the first time, and then a terse version from then on, not AC. Every time you talk to a shop keeper you get the whole 4 or 5 dialog box spiel you have to click through (even pressing b to speed things up it's still a chore), want to post a few presents to friends? *Every* one requires you to read 'hmmm, it looks like they have a postcard rack, maybe I could...' - 'who do you want to send it to?' - 'connecting to the internet' -etc, and when you're done, do you go back to the previous menu for more? No, you're kicked out to start again... 'hmmm, it looks like...'\rThis coupled with the above items means for example it takes *minutes* to buy one of each of the few flowers on sale from the flower merchant; click through spiel, choose item, buy, watch unnecessary animation of bells being handed over and flower being handed back, click another message, repeat. We need multi-select to buy (like fossil assessment), we need shopkeepers to have a 'I've heard this message 300 times, please just say hello and go straight to the wares' mode.\rSome shops even force you to click out of a dialog just to exit the shop!\r The island-visitor restrictions are odd, and strikes me (as a software developer for over 20 years) as a quick workaround rather than solve an underlying issue:\rWhy do we need to close dialogs when someone is visiting?\rWhy do we need to watch a (needlessly long, honestly, what other games take so long for people to join?) progress animation as they 'fly in'\rWhy can I not place items when someone is there?\rWhy can I not talk to a shopkeeper when a visitor is in the changing room.\rAll these things make the friends/visitor mechanism stilted, janky and, like everything else, a chore\r Every time you catch or make something you have to watch a little 'look what I caught/made' animation, with a terrible pun, of which there is only one per item: 'I caught a sea bass, oh no it's at least a C plus' (I have stopped fishing simply because of these, and of course, you have to click again, to dismiss it.\rWith crafting, each item (and YOU CAN ONLY MAKE ONE AT A TIME) has an animation too (while you can speed up the crafting time, basically, you have to sit there mashing a button to make a number of the same items\r All of which could be avoided if they weren't pretty much the only thing to do in the game... like, any kind of quests apart from help Gulliver find his bits and help Whisp find his bits.\r Basically the only thing to do is fish, craft, catch bugs, shop and those things take 5x as much time and 5x as many button clicks as they need to (even keeping the immersive chatty nature some might like) and all interactions are repetitive, there's no variation.\rNone of the game-play is fluid, very little is intuitive and that 'what's the point' feeling creeps in very quickly.\r If you want crafting, smooth multi-play, adventure etc... Get portal knights, AC did not get QA tested with users playing for a length of time.","1 Island for console limitation.I cannot play this game because my girlfriend has played 125 hours and I want my own new Game.Fix that s**t","Per giocare con figli o fidanzate, mogli o persone del nucleo familiare, sappiate che ci vuole una console a testa perch\u00e9 una funzione BASE come quella di avere pi\u00f9 salvataggi su un un\u2019unica console NON C\u2019\u00c8.Nel 2020 sembra una barzelletta ma cos\u00ec non \u00e8.

They see your island and pick fruit with you and that\u2019s it. One game per console, not profile, means only one person can play period. Others can switch profiles, but if they aren\u2019t the main account it\u2019s not their island. The game honestly feels like it\u2019s a beta. Very rushed, poor UI, and little to no potential growth for the game as it stands. Nintendo already has my money don\u2019t let them take yours.

We let her start up the game, and a few hours later, realized we could not have our own islands.  After 5 minutes of finding out the things I couldn\u2019t do, I quit.  Possibly the worst decision made by Nintendo in. Along time.  To make a family friendly, family oriented game impossible for families to enjoy together.  I\u2019m hoping for Nintendo to see this so they change it.

My brother said he could wait for the game to eventually add that feature of more than one island on a switch and I feel really bad for him. Nintendo, if you see this. Please just update it.

Every other game has different users have different save files! Did Nintendo expect a family to have multiple switches?!?! If they did, then there would be no reason to have only 1 island. They thought it would be some cute little addition to the game for siblings to play on the same island. But that can\u2019t be further from the truth. It\u2019s like a full war, especially how resources can only be collected ONCE per day. Now, I agree that\u2019s perfectly balanced and makes sense, but not when there\u2019s siblings fighting over who gets the rocks or fruit or fossils. This whole thing, wouldn\u2019t even be the worst thing ever, if everyone had the power of the resident representative! Like, my sister managed to log on first, and she barely even plays! But she plays enough that she won\u2019t let me take over her account. So if I want to move a building, make a bridge, etc, I have to drop money, save, go on her account, build the thing, save, then go back on my account. It\u2019s ridiculous! Why can\u2019t the other players make bridges inclines layout changes etc. Not to mention only the main user can do the tasks to try to get K.K. on the island. Also the main user gets certain recipes that other users can not get unless they find it in a ballon gift thing. Besides the terrible terrible design, I like this game a lot and I can\u2019t stop playing it. I just wish Nintendo would listen to the community and make this REALLY easy change.","Seemed like fun, and i was REALLY exited. Well, my mom got on the game first and selected an island, and now she owns the game, and the ONLY POSSIBLE GAME SAVE. i cant contribute ANYTHING meaningful to the game, other than collecting sticks and crafting things. She gets to make every decision on the island and my WHOLE family has to share this one island, and all of it's resorces. We ran out of stones to get iron &amp; gold from. The couch co-op mode is terrible too. As a second player all of your items get directly sent to the \"town lost and found\" and anyone can take it out of the box, except for you, WHO COLLECTED IT. This would make sense if it was a 50 dollar consol or something that each person in our family could have but to spend 300 BUCKS to fully play a game on your own is ridiculous. So basically, i cant even play the game, i cant help move out island in the right direction, and i cant play an important role as a second player. And this is all on a 60 dollar game that my dad bought. Glad ONE person gets to enjoy it.","Good game. But the fact that I cannot play my own game if my wife plays hers first is ridiculous.","Only allowing one island per console is so insane that it didn\u2019t even cross my mind as something I would have to worry about when I bought the game. Every other game I can think of allows for multiple profiles/saves. It\u2019s baffling. It would be cool to visit other locally created islands but still control your own. But instead everybody in a house has to be beholden to the game progress of the first person to play the game. The switch is a family console, yet only one person gets to enjoy the full experience of this game? It really just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.","1 island per switch??? how greedy can you be. this is so anti consumer its not even funny!!\rThis gets an instant 0 for me.","The experience when you're an additional player is complete and utter garbage. Great game when you're the mayor, otherwise it's just pocket camp with a new coat of paint.","I played this game for 3 straight hours, running around having a ball with my partner. Only to find out when she had left I am unable to progress the storyline as I am not the \"citizen representative\". For the price of a triple A game to only have one \"shared\" save file is ruthlessly corrupt. Dont buy this game if you have a husband, a wife, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, son, daughter, brother or sister. I guess what I'm saying is, don't buy this game.","My friend &amp; I pooled our money to buy a switch &amp; ACNH. It was the one thing I was looking forward to (&amp; a major investment) after my life has been completely upended by the pandemic. To say that this is the most disappointing purchase of my life is an understatement. My friend started the game first, &amp; I didn\u2019t realize how much it sucks to be the second player. I was basically plopped on her island (with Resident Services, Nooks Cranny, &amp; the Museum already built) with a tent &amp; no in-game instructions or prompts to do anything or what my overarching game goals were. I forged ahead, playing for 2 days looking up articles all the time to figure out how to do things. I finally came across other reviews &amp; realized its not just me - it\u2019s the entire 2nd player experience. I wish I had spent my money on groceries instead.","When they fix this game, the score will go to 9, it will stay on 0 for now because of 1 switch, and for Nintendo prizing to you just because someone else plays on your switch a incomplete experience for free for 60 dollars","Might be a good game but I'll never know without buying a second switch as I'm stuck behind the 1 island per switch rule.","My wife and I bought this game. We both paid for it (half and half).I just realize I can't contribute with important decisions on the island just because I started to play after my wife and she is the only one that can make important decisions in the island. That sucks, Nintendo, that really sucks! We won't spend on another Nintendo switch + another AC game to play the way we want to! Fix this!!! I can only enjoy like 30% of the game, so I give 30% of a rating.","This game gutted me. There are so many things Nintendo and the game itself don't mention in the intro or gameplay. I honestly wished I'd never played the game. If you have little kids, this could be a real heart-breaker! Imagine having them cry and scream because their island and all their items got wiped out due to an accident or corrupt data. I played almost 600 hours and built up a beautiful island with lots of items. Then my Switch stopped working today and all of my data is gone. See all the other comments. ***This game is different because it's tied to the console, not the cloud or an SD card. There's no way to save your data!  If you want two players, you basically have to buy another Switch (and good luck finding one right now!). This game can be incredibly addicting, especially if you play online with other people. You develop some real bonds with both live people and your island villagers. If your Switch breaks, all that is gone with no way to get it back or find the people you played with again. It's the emotional equivalent of experiencing the death a friend or losing your personal items in a fire. Very poorly designed. Not well thought-out or executed. It's like Nintendo rushed to put it on the market before working out all the bugs.","I just bought it, and I let my brother start the game, and it turns out that with my account I can't get the progress of the game to advance, when it's my Nintendo Switch. Terrible decision that there is a single spokesperson for the island.\r I am disappointed in the game, since in that case they would have better allowed one island per profile.","Absolutely unthinkably stupid to limit one island per switch. Asinine. Idiotic.\r My kids were excited about all the buzz, they were thrilled to visit the website and see how they could make their own little world.  Then they bought it. To have that reality yanked away, I don't think I'm being overly dramatic here, but it was kinda cruel. My kids saved up to buy this game. What in god's name are they thinking?\r It's lovely to see, in the time of forced quarantine, a game touting itself as a stress relieving, calming, creative time spender, to literally 'yoink' that promise away for everyone but the first household member to log on.\r Anyone who has anything to do with this should be ashamed, because you should know, and I don't think I'm the only one: you literally made my kids cry. Not because they're spoiled, or that they can't share, or they won't work together.  It's that they saved up for something that was advertised as \"something\" and got absolutely blindsided by a product that is specifically, maliciously exclusive of their creative interests.  It's about having watched hours of people loving the game on youtube, and then the game saying, 'No, you absolutely cannot do what they are doing.'\r Of course, the \"same island\" mode as it exists would be SO MUCH FUN...if it was an option.\r If you gave this game a good score because you're the only person playing it...I think you're missing the point. This game is mean to families. It is. There's not really another way to put this.","Aya keygoku and the other Nintendo EPD developers did not know how to develop this  Nintendo game for 1 its special edition doesn't even come with the flip-in game (for those Europeans and Japanese people you're lucky here in Mexico, the US or Canada don't have the game in the bundle) 2nd 1 island per switch thing is awful, in city folk you could have 8 accounts but in new horizons, I cant 3rd ROVER'S NOT IN THE GAME (yes mayday brought him back but that was a week) HE'S THE MASCOT OF THE GAME Gamecube, city folk (let's go to the city), New leaf all had him start with you in this game TIMMY AND TOMMY THE WORST CHARACTERS IN ANY AC game DO THAT. 4th PLAYING ONLINE COSTS MONEY in the WFC games (Wild world and Wii) and Nintendo network games (new leaf) you didn't pay a penny to Nintendo to play online this game,(and all switch games) you have to pay Nintendo $3 \u00a32.43 for UK Readers a month for 3 years that's  $108. 5th there's No MAYOR from Gamecube to new leaf tortemer was the mayor in new leaf you were the mayor in new horizons there's no mayor (isabelle might be the mayor idk). 6th Nook's cranny isn't really nook's cranny anymore. Either they got booted from nookling junction or it got closed ladies and gentlemen TMMY AND TOMMY THE WORST CHARACTERS IN ANY AC game TOOK OVER nook's cranny. 7th and final thing that I hate about this game instead of being the mayor your the Citizen Representative (once again isabelle might be the mayor idk). in conduction, THIS IS A CASH GRAB. THIS IS EA levels of bad","My boyfriend and I got a switch JUST to play this game together.But hey, whats the point if only one player can truly enjoy it?! Second player cant do anything or make any decisions. The second player is basically a glorified NPC. This needs to be fixed. It feels like a f***ing scam tbh.","I was pretty excited to get into the animal crossing series but this is one of the most boring, lazy, content lacking games I've ever played. There is so little to do, all you do is shake trees, catch stuff, and buy stuff. There's less content here then kirby star allies and all you do is chores. No animal crossing does not make chores fun, it just dresses them up a bit. It's essentially empty busy work to make it look like you have something to do. Have you ever had a game tell you how you have to play?, no?, then try new horizons. The npc's are boring, isabelle is nothing more then a mold for a cute character and nothing more, the other villagers only have 2 or 3 lines when you talk to them and the UI is so clunky it takes like 6 minutes for me to leave somebody's island, go grab an item from storage, and then come back. This is the worst game I've ever played. I'd rather play paper mario sticker star.","Fix your damn game and suppress the console limitation, thanks. This is unacceptable.","The fact that only one island per Switch is allowed is completely ridiculous. It's a cash grab. Awful.","I made a Metacritic account just to express how disappointed I am with this game. I've been playing the Animal Crossing series since Wild World on the Nintendo DS.  I was SO hyped for this game. I got it the minute it came out on launch day, played for about a month straight aaaaand... I don't play it anymore.\r This game is mediocre hence the 5 out of 10 score. Sure the graphics are nice, it runs well and the terraforming is a huge new feature. But Nintendo released an unfinished game. This game does NOT have enough content to justify the \u00a350 I payed at launch day. So many iconic characters are missing. Where's Resetti? Where are Copper and Booker? Most importantly of all where are Rover and Brewster??? Yes I know Rover appeared briefly in the May Day update but honestly it wasn't enough screen time for such an iconic character.\r Here's my other gripes with the game:\r - Iconic characters like Rover got shafted but we have to sit through Isabelle's boring dialogue every single day. In this game Isabelle does the morning updates so no more Rover in the spotlight. Isabelle is frankly an extremely annoying character in this game, always repeating the same dialogue about how she found her sock or something. She's supposed to report the news but the devs didn't think for her to perhaps report on the weather or mention which town visitors are on the island. Nah it's more important for us to hear about how she finished her puzzle (nobody cares Isabelle).\r - Speaking of dialogue, the villagers feel soulless compared to other games. What is the point of even talking to them when they repeat the same crap? And they always get annoyed when you talk to them twice in the same day. What a joke.\r - Furniture sets are gone. No more Froggy Chair was bad enough but so many iconic furniture sets just ceased to exist. I like being able to craft but not at the expense of many classic items which fans have loved for a long time. Gracie Grace is missing from the game so now I can't decorate my house with ridiculously expensive dessert shaped furniture - wtf is the point in playing?\r - Speaking of crafting, it is a long and tedious process. Say you want to craft 1 fish bait. You can't just craft 100 at once. Oh no you have to do it one by one. Everything in this game is unnecessarily difficult and even though fans have been begging for quality of life changes for months Nintendo don't care.\r - Events are so bad now. The egg event in previous days was just one day. This time it was a 2 week fiasco where your normal daily activities were interrupted by the stupid eggs. During the egg event you could catch eggs by fishing, from the sky etc. The problem was that this completely ruined fishing as it felt like 80% of what you caught was eggs instead of actual fish. If all events are going to be like this from now on I'm not looking forward to events like Halloween.\r - Town visitors seem to visit certain players over others with some people getting Celeste (who gives rare DIY recipes) every week while other players like myself have never had her on the island despite playing since launch day.\r - Finally, on to the terraforming... It's boring. That's all. It is so tedious and so boring. I don't enjoy the terraforming which is a shame because it's the only thing to do in this game. If it's something you think you may enjoy go ahead, buy the game but ever since I unlocked terraforming my playtime has probably dropped by 80%.\r There are so many other gripes I have with this game but these are the ones I had off the top of my head. It seems like Nintendo aims to keep updating the game every few months with the content that should have been included on launch day. Apparently this is to \"combat time travel\" (also why they set events to 2 weeks so people would have to play during the 2 weeks and wouldn't be able to travel back to events). I don't see why Nintendo had to release such a bare bones game just because some people are triggered by people who play the game differently.\r Anyway, maybe in a year when Nintendo has actually added the content that should have been in the game to begin with I'll go back to this game but for now I can't be bothered to dedicate any time to this boring game.","As a family we have to share an island or buy another Switch. No thanks Nintendo. Brainwashed fanboy/girls will throw their money at Nintendo without a thought. Not this family.","I'm a long time fan of the franchise and made the mistake of letting my wife play it first on the Switch, because I wanted to introduce her to the game in hopes she would like it.  This was before i realized there ould only be 1 island per device.  Now I can't even play the game that I'm am the original fan of.","It's great for hanging out. If you're looking for a game where you accomplish certain goals and then your done, then probably you won't like Animal Crossing. This game is to enjoy the little details, relax and hang out. You can spend several hours just watching your villagers, fishing, building, decorating and re building your island without any defined goal","You need to buy 1 Nintendo swicht + 1 game per family member + 1 online sub to be able to each play the story. This game, and nintendo globally is a shame.\rI'm done with nintendo, you will never have 1$ from me anymore.","Only 1 island per console- even if you have separate profiles, nope! Only 1 island. They expect you to buy another Switch for each additional island. What if you have a family and everyone just wants to enjoy the game? Unbelievable.","Boring, tedious and devoid of content. This isn't a game but more of a chore and is an absolute rip-off, value wise, demanding a AAA full price sticker. The game should be a $20 USD title at best given how repetitive and empty the \"gameplay\" is. I couldn't tolerate it for more than 5-10 hours and is, easily, one of my biggest regrets on the Switch. Too bad I bought a digital copy, otherwise I would've traded it a few days after buying it. Can't recommend this to anyone unless you're a fan of burning money.","A huge disappointment and let down because of a bizarre decision to have one island per switch with all important progress and gameplay mechanics tied to the first account that plays it.Context is important here as people seem to be dismissing this issue as not important. Co-op and multiplayer is not the issue, as some people might want to play the way it is implemented. The issue is that any other account on the system that plays AFTER the first person to open the game is FORCED to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience. It is then not an equapl, stand alone playthrough with all the features of one.A lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account. That is fine. But a lot of people have more than one account on their Switch. To say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it doesn't address the core problem.It's 2020 and we can't have multiple accounts play their own instance of a game? Yes we can, Nintendo has just chosen not to here. For a game that is trying to be a calming community experience, It has only made me feel conned and frustrated and left out because of this.As someone who is sharing the game with someone in my household, however being the second account to play, I am forced to be an observer to someone elses enjoyment of the game. If you are not the first person to play this game on your Switch you might as well not play it at all as you do not get the full experience. That is unless you buy another switch to have the privilege.This is a frankly disgusting and pointless choice that only serves to ruin the experience for many people who buy the game and line the pockets of Nintendo. Even the person who played it first feels guilty for playing it, even though they had no control other it.Be wary before buying this game; unless you play on your own switch, first, on your account from the outset, you will not have the full experience you expected when you bought it. I will be extremely hesitant to buy any future Nintendo games because of this.On a positive note, the person who first started playing on their account on my Switch says it's a lovely game. Shame I can't play what they're playing.","\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e21\u0e35\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e07 \u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e07\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e49\u0e19\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e43\u0e19\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e48\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30 \u0e14\u0e35\u0e43\u0e08\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e46 \u0e16\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e04\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e08\u0e30\u0e14\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35 2020 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27","This new Animal Crossing shows everyone can make mistakes, or just decide they want to be EA. This is very much just a mix of Pocket Camp, Wild World, and New Leaf. The game has an overly-long tutorial before letting you do what you want. There is also the fact that parts of your island are completely locked because you don't have any bridges built at the start unlike other games, and it's a while before you build bridges or unlock the vaulting pole. Nintendo also shows their greed in wanting you to buy more Switch consoles, as it is not 1 island per Nintendo Switch user, it's 1 island per Nintendo Switch console. And the only way to get a new or second island is to delete your first. This game also excludes the character of the fan favorite and my personal favorite, Rover. He does not appear on the plane to the island to help you (instead that role is filled by Nook's little scouts), and he doesn't appear in the game at all. My only things to say in defense of this game is that for once the game lets you decide what your villager's appearance is instead of generating it with cryptic questions like the other games (and usually no matter what you answered for the questions, you didn't like how your villager looked). The other thing is that Tom Nook appears to be less greedy and more friendly. He has general interactions the way a peppy villager, or Isabelle, or one of the Ables would instead of constant badgering and pressuring you about money like he does in other games.","The kids and I were excited to get this after watching the trailer, since we are stuck at home.  They play a lot of minecraft and like to play in each other's worlds.  I was ok with sharing an island, sharing resources, and working together.  It could have been fun to play as a team.  Now that we're playing though the game is miserable for players 2-4.  My son can't unlock an axe so he had to get his sister, who happened to get lucky and be the first player, to make him one.  The only work around is having the rest of us play multiplayer using her character, but she is still the only one who can complete any of the tasks and advance the game.  It's boring and frustrating for the other players.  I would return it but they are invested in the island now, but it's creating a lot of conflict.  Do not recommend for families.  I'm not buying another Switch for me to casually take part in one game.  My pre teen daughter who is player one doesn't even play video games that much anymore. It's pretty ridiculous that Nintendo thinks we will all just buy another system or two for one game.  It should not have been marketed as multiplayer and I feel like the advertising video was completely misleading.","Ideally this would be like the GameCube version, where every player could have their own island, but that's not horrible by itself.  What's horrible is only allowing one player per console to be the \"real player\", while everyone else gets half a game.  I own hundreds of games and I cannot think of a single other game designed as a \"one player per console\" game.  This would be inexplicable if it wasn't Nintendo.","I love this game, but like all the other reviews I don't like the \"1 island per switch\", my brother was super excited for this game and it's terrible to see him upset, that just broke my connection with the game. I get some people are going to say, \"Why don't you just share?\" Well, I'm now learning that the first visitor, Me, has all the power, from naming the island, to even getting DIY recipes. Nintendo please fix this! I don't want to see my brother upset and have to get a new switch! Switches are kinda pricey for our family, plus getting a new copy would just break the bank.","For me, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year. As a single-player experience, I'd say going around and improving your island is relaxing and addicting. The Nook Miles system brings me back to the game everyday to try to save up for new rewards. The new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials. Even with all of this, there's one huge issue that cannot be ignored that many others have complained about.\r Animal Crossing fails the most at co-op. The fact that you can only have one island per Switch seems greedy, so that customers go out to buy more switches. Even if you buy another copy of the game, it won't give you another island. That means me and my siblings are forced to live on one island. The leader and follower system can very annoying to deal with, especially if you really want to get things done on your island. The leader retains all of the abilities a regular player would have, but the followers are basically glorified NPCs. The followers can't access their inventory or interact with other residents. Followers can only use their tools and pick things up. When they do pick something up, it goes straight to the recycling bin, for the leader to potentially steal, or for a drawn out sequence where the players have to switch between leaders. It doesn't help that sometimes my siblings sometimes try to cuck me and steal my resources to sell, or for one of them to steal leader from me. It's also annoying that you can shake your controller to change leader. My siblings just shake my hands and steal leader. I'd really like an option to turn that off. I don't get why they locked these features to just one player. It really waters down the experience for me who was excited, since I'll be playing mostly co-op with my siblings.\r The biggest flaw with co-op play, the thing that really kills the experience for me, has to be the Island Representative system. There can only be one Island Representative, the person who first opens the game. They are also the only person who is able to progress the story, along with other exclusive benefits like exclusive DIY recipes. That would be fine if there was multiple save files, but the problem is there isn't. The other players that live on the island just have have a way worse experience. I'm not saying it's not fun to play as a villager, I'm just saying you're not getting the full experience. It can still be fun to decorate your house and to complete daily tasks.\r I think this game is at its best when playing single-player. Co-op at the moment is terrible and not having extra saves can ruin the experience for many. Also, please keep in mind I don't have access to a single-player save. I'd recommend this game to people to people who have Switches that only they use. This game just isn't made for multiple people to with. Even if my siblings did cooperate with me, the game would still be 6.","Appalling money-grab from Nintendo in that only one island can be made PER SWITCH. This means if you want to fully experience the game, you must buy another switch console. This is ridiculous and I have never played a game that does not allow for more than one save file on the same console. Nintendo must fix this, as it is transparent that this design choice was greed-driven.","The game is completely ruined for the second player. With the inability for multiple islands you would think Nintendo would have made all players on the island equal. No. Only the original character can actually participate in the majority of the game. Only they can build things and upgrade shops and progress the game. All other characters are treated as second class citizens. This is completely ridiculous. As someone who shares a switch, and has been waiting for this game for seven years, I am unable to play it because I can\u2019t access what was advertised due to these arbitrary limitations that are outdated and unnecessary.","Multiplayer sucks. It really makes it hard to enjoy the game when you bought it to play with your partner and the second player is so limited it is boring. It makes sense for children sharing the game with one being too young to make decisions but feels ridiculous and a waste of money for adults to play. And don't get me started on the one island per console problem (eye-roll).\r Stardew Valley makes Nintendo look lazy and money-hungry for putting this out and marketing it as multiplayer. The animation is cute though and I really hope Nintendo beefs up multiplayer.","This game is really beautiful and relaxing.The people at Nintendo really put effort into this and it is worth the delay that it gets. Every time you build something it felt like an accomplishment but things like getting material from rocks tree and other needs to take a day to replenish which is disappointing and waiting for a building to be build makes me really impatient all the time.This game could been benefitted from less waiting time it felt like eternity to wait for things to be done","I'm a veteran AC player, and while I like the game it definitely has its issues. A lot of this review is nitpicky, but at the end of the day if you enjoy life sims you will probably like this. It is overall a nice game.\r Pros:\r-Almost total control over the layout of your island eventually\r-More customization options for furniture, clothing and even your character than before\r-HD graphics are beautiful, the new museum in particular is stunning\r-The music is great, and has a lot of callbacks to older games in the series\r-Villagers do a lot more things than they have in previous entries and have better dialogue than they did in NL; Blathers will blather again if you let him\r-Seasonal events now last more than one day; a relief for those of us who have jobs but don't want to time travel\r-Extremely large pool of villagers\r-Certain redundant facilities were cut, like Re-Tail\r-New storage and inventory system is pretty great; lots of more items stack, storage automatically organizes your things\r-Tool and outfit rings streamline the UI nicely\r-Nook Miles give a nice sense of direction when you just want to keep playing the game after doing most of the big tasks for the day\r-Crafting provides a nice alternative to waiting for items to show up at the store\r-Outfits are stored in the wand, which saves inventory space\r-Very relaxing atmosphere\r Cons:\r-Touchscreen controls exist for typing, yet are not enabled for pattern creation or inventory use\r-Items that can stack have wildly varying limits, from 10 for fruit to 99 for weeds\r-The tutorial is roughly a week long if you don't time travel, and you don't get to listen to hourly themes until this tutortial ends\r-Autosave system is near pointless because you can still save scum, even detrimental because you can't \"save and continue\" anymore, leading to short rollbacks at times; Resetti got fired for nothing\r-Seasonal events are locked behind DRM\r-Lots of items and facilities considered series staples are out like gyroids and The Roost, as are some of the best additions from NL like the Dream Suite; veterans are instead left to guess whether or not these might return through updates that may or may not be free\r-Villager dialogue is still relatively toned down if you're a fan of WW or PG\r-No ability to move the town hall despite being able to move everything else not on the beach\r-Online functionality is not particularly reliable, while local multiplayer is messy and requires you to stay in the same area instead of just using split screen functionality; also you have to watch a long cutscene every time there's a visitor\r-No option to disable the smoothing filter applied to patterns\r-Weapon durability in a series that generally did not have it is aggravating, and having the highest tier be breakable is actually a bit infuriating because it defeats the purpose of the best axe in particular\r-Tools aren't stored in the tool ring like outfits are in the wand\r-Islands are tied to console and not cart, meaning you need to pay $300 ($360 if you bought digital like a sucker) instead of $60 to have your own if you were hoping to split up your household\r-The \"mayor\" returns from NL in all but name, leaving players that come after them left with fewer gameplay options because they can't terraform\r-Your regular inventory is not automatically organized like storage is\r-Many items are locked behind crafting\r-Crafting cannot be done in batches\r-Making a mistake in a long set of choices in dialogue often means starting from the beginning again; there is usually no option to go back to the previous choice you messed up","As many have stated the pure stupidity behind the decision for one island per switch amazes me. literally just brought a switch for me and my partner with this game and one of us has to just be a tag along. Imagine any other game doing this it would be stupid please change this.","This game is relaxing, fun, and a fantastic way to escape from the awful things that are going on in the world. Fishing, crafting, selling, catching, it all just feels really rewarding.","El juego perfecto para la cuarentena.\rLa cantidad de horas que se le pueden dedicar es infinita.\rExcelente juego con muchas opciones para ir evolucionando tu isla.\r \u00a1Magn\u00edfico!","I am loving the game so far. The only setback is the limitation to just one island per switch and that the local multiplayer player could be much better.","This is my first Animal Crossing game and it is great. It makes a lot of fun and is really addictive. I could play it forever. The game is just great and very relaxing.","Most of the negatives that are mentioned in some reviews here don't apply to me, because I am the only one using my Switch to play that particular game. I do understand though, that it must be upsetting for people with family in the household and one switch device, and now they cannot all enjoy the game the way they thought. To me, the game is almost perfect, the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect score is the still not resolved issue with the cloud save option. Considering that Animal Crossing is a game that many people play for years, it would be terrible to lose all of the progress when your Switch gets damaged/lost or you simply would love to get a different Switch console.\rOther than that, it is a incredibly cute game that keeps me wanting to go back and play every day, which I was not expecting, since this is my first Animal Crossing game I've ever played.","This game has caused lots of heartache for my kids. The fact that you can only do one island per console is a terrible thing to do to children. Each wanted to make their own island and visit each other's island. But greedy stupid Nintendo really screwed this game up.","One Island per switch. Absolutely trash menu system. Trash inventory Management. Villagers do more passive things but rarely give you things to do. Load times are forever for no reason. No way to evict villagers you dont like, and no way to reset their wardrobe either, so god forbid they pick up some ugly clothing out of nowhere. Cant set up DL'd custom design in shop. Honestly this game, while fun to play for a few weeks, is so crammed full of absolutely Garbage Tier design choices, I've stopped playing entirely. Maybe if they fix all their Day One Dev mistakes I'll come back, but seeing as its Nintendo I doubt they even see an issue. You'd think they've never made a game before, or havent been around for the last decade where crafting have been put into pretty much every game, and far better than in this one. Just stay in New Leaf, it made far better decisions than this game.","Poor graphics, no voiced dialogue, small islands, and the worst multiplayer functionality I've ever seen.  Trying to play this co-op with my wife &amp; son is a nightmare.  Even with 2 switches in the house one of us doesn't get an island and can only \"support\" the other 2 people.  We have to buy multiple copies just to do local co-op between the islands.  We each must have a Nintendo online account to visit other friends and family islands.  Like pokemon this game has been stuck in the past, with out of date visuals, audio, and features.  The devs are unwilling or unable to make real improvements in the franchise.  Multiplayer was advertised as a great new feature and disappoints in every possible way.","This game is completely ruined by the fact you need to have 2 concoles and 2 games to play in the same household, especially when the price for entry is currently over 500 dollars for the console and game because of price gouging.","Whilst yes, multiplayer is very heavily lacking, that's no reason for the horrible reviews most people are giving it. As a game, let alone an animal crossing game, it is absolutely wonderful full of life and care. As a singleplayer experience, it is absolutely wonderful. I don't honestly understand why people are treating it so poorly for it's same screen multiplayer. While I can admit it's very strange, and not well done, people are treating it as if it is something that has been in every game and was ruined in this game. This is the first time that same screen multiplayer has ever been implemented, so it works alright for what it is. The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 in my opinion, is the fact that others who live on the island other than the first person to move in, can not place things around the island, only in their own home. This takes away a lot of what this game advertises, and leaves the  game essentially New Leaf + crafting. The game is wonderful, and anyone who needs a life sim or something to help them relax from their stressful life should buy this game.","Realmente adictivo, siempre hay mil cosas que hacer. No he podido parar de jugar desde que sali\u00f3!","A beautiful and very fun game. Having an island per console is fine. If you are looking for a local cooperative game, play something else, as Animal Crossing was always intended to be an individual life simulator. The cooperative it's just an extra.","Grande decep\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o com o jogo, que \u00e9 fant\u00e1stico para entregar o que promete (apesar de n\u00e3o ser um estilo para todos), mas com as decis\u00f5es da Nintendo para com ele.O que voc\u00ea precisa saber antes de comprar:- Somente uma ilha por console- N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fazer nada como o player 2 no coop local- N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel jogar coop online mesmo que tenha 2 switch (e 1 jogo)- N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel transferir o save pra outro console- N\u00e3o suporta save cloud- N\u00e3o tem \"matchmaking\"Muito limitado para um jogo dessa gera\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma pena.","I bought this game digitally for my wife and I. Started the game under my account. Wife wanted to play but cannot play her own game. She has limited abilities to play within my game space. This game doesn't let more than one person have an island on a Nintendo Switch. Not even if you have multiple accounts, with multiple Nintendo Online subs. Do not support this.","\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 91\uc810 \uac8c\uc784\uc778\uc9c0 \uc54c\uc218\uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub2e4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","Fun game for the first player to arrive on the island. If anyone else in the household plays, they are essentially a meaningless NPC that is unable to impact the story in any meaningful way. Terrible design decision that I hope they will reverse.\r The game itself is fun for the most part, even if it feels like it needs more variety after a while. It is clearly a game to just have fun with and if I could actually play the game properly, it might be fun for me. My wife is enjoying it (primary player) though. Multiplayer aspect is incredibly shallow too, I expected more from that.\r I would say if Nintendo reverses their boneheaded single island move, it could be winner but they have sold a bajillion copies of it and likely dont care. Nintendo = Tom Nook.","The game keeps getting better with the updates, and is set to be the best in the series whilst keeping to the core aim of the game - this being to promote co-operation with players and build a sense of community around the development of a small village.  If you can't play well with others, this game isn't for you.","Probably one of my favourite switch games 9 points because it doesn't have cloud saves and you can only have one Island per console.Great game","Even if Co-op playing is a little awkward, this game is one of Nintendo's great games. It inherited the advantages of ACNL, and gave players a variety of consideration in terms of convenience.","Honestly my favorite game to come out in the past few years. It's especially nice amid this COVID-19 problem. Just going to my happy place.","The game has been great so far!! The pacing is really nice and I love all of the cute villagers. This is the first Animal Crossing game I've played and have been immediately hooked to it. The character customization features are nice too.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best Animal Crossing game I have ever played! I have played since Thursday night and have loved every minute of it.","Extremely relaxing game with very fun npc\u2019s to interact with 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Always been a huge Animal Crossing fan, since the original. I love all the tiny details Nintendo included. It\u2019s just so cute! It\u2019s definitely making lockdown a lot more bearable.","This game is everything I was hoping the first console release since the Wii to be. It takes everything great from the series and expands on it. I admit that as a fan I was bit bogged down by the 3DS New Leaf. It made the game feel more like work and a job to me instead of the laid back relaxing life I was used to in the past titles. However New Horizons makes it just feel like part of the everyday activities. I was afraid of the additions from the mobile game ruining the usual experience as well, but they implemented it in such a way as it just feels like an option and not a requirement to craft at all. Though it does make it nice to have both options when you're low on money OR low on supplies you always have a way to get the tools you need! The airport is an awesome addition as well as it's used for your travel between friends' towns as well as getting to use Nook tickets to visit islands that have more recources than your own! Especially if you play solo. You get the benefits of visiting a friend's island without needing a friend for it! All of the people bashing this game over the shared island when having more than one account on the same system....that's part of the series's charm. You always share an island in every version on the consoles. If you want it to be like on the DS or 3DS you can always get separate Nintendo Switches and have your own islands JUST like on those versions. The fact that you can play locally on the same system at the same time together is a HUGE add to multiplayer and I think they've done so many great things in this version. I also think that the addition of building up to getting the musuem and other buildings in this version is done in a very satisfying way where you don't have everything right away like the old ones (so you feel like there is something to work toward) but it doesn't feel like a chore or a job like in New Leaf. As someone who was a bit disappointed with New Leaf, I love this new one and am excited as I grow my new animal home! See you on that island life, neighbors!","This game makes me so happy! It\u2019s not incredibly story-driven like a lot of today\u2019s games, but it\u2019s more about the day-to-day life of your villager. Instead of checking off quests &amp; deadlines, you set your own pace for how you want to play. Do you want to cross-pollinate flowers to make new colors? Do you want to catch all the fish and find all the bugs? Do you want to fill up your museum? Do you want to design a dream island?? You can do ALL of that - the beauty of this game is that you get to choose what you want to do. It\u2019s not a game about stress, speed, time, combat, or achievements (although there ARE achievements, the game doesn\u2019t revolve around them). It\u2019s about enjoying yourself!I wish Nintendo had handled the multiplayer a bit differently. And I wish there were more things to do with friends when visiting their island/vice versa! But ultimately this game is relaxing, adorable, and fun.10/10 would recommend!!","The best game in the series, the amount of care and effort put into it is outstanding. Definitely the only thing keeping me sane in this lockdown.","Super fun game. I do question Tom Nook's predatory lending practices. I owe him more than I do my actual bank.","This game is fantastic so far. New Horizons gives a stronger, better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous Animal Crossing game. While the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island, there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week. Villagers are as charismatic as ever, and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch, fossils to discover, items to craft, and Nookmiles rewards to earn is astounding. Only a few days in, my wife and I have had multiple chance-encounters with special NPCs that add a sense of intrigue and wonder to the game. As a cherry on top, the game is also beautiful; the aesthetics, soundtrack, and sound-design make for a soothing and satisfying experience.I personally think the co-op play is great. My wife and I inhabiting the same island is not an issue, and in fact we enjoy working together and surprising one another with our creative ideas and discoveries. While it would be nice if we both had all the freedoms that the \"leader\" position offers at once, it is so quick and easy to switch leaders that we have no problem tag-teaming whatever we're working on. If I could ask for one thing, I would a split-screen co-op feature. However, the current system serves well in its own rite.I'm very excited to continue playing New Horizons, developing our island, and making new discoveries. I appreciate the hard work that's gone into this game, and I'm thankful in advance for the content updates that will continue to make this game an exciting and enjoyable experience. Thanks, Nintendo!","I have been playing Animal Crossing since it came out on the GameCube and I was 9 years old. I\u2019ve played Wild World on the Nintendo DS, City Folk on Wii, and New Leaf, but New Horizons throws it out of the water! What an amazing game! The attention to detail in every aspect is tremendous! It\u2019s truly a master piece. I do not understand the negative reviews based on not being able to have more than one island per switch. If you are a fan, or new to the series you love the game all the same! Don\u2019t let the naysayers Sway you away.","El juego es genial de verdad. He tenido que venir hasta aqu\u00ed solo para darle la nota que se merce porque he visto la gente que le est\u00e1 dando una nota no merecida y poco justificada. El juego me ha sorprendido gratamente en TODOS los aspectos. Su punto d\u00e9bil ser\u00eda el multijugador, pero al poder jugar tantas personas a la vez, se lo paso","Sinceramente en comparaci\u00f3n con otras sagas el juego ha renovado en muchas cosas, me encanta la jugabilidad y es muy bonito.","El juegos es muy divertido. el mejor de la saga, eh jugado ya 5 d\u00edas a este juego y me siento muy satisfecho. lo malo es que solo se puede una isla por switch, pero despu\u00e9s todos esta muy bien.","Fantastic game with great graphics and constant fun and things to do. First Animal Crossing game with a small plot/storyline. Very entertaining. Personally I do not mind the multiplayer feature and I am okay with being limited to one island per console. If you don\u2019t mind sharing, this game is perfect. Absolutely everything that an Animal Crossing game should be, packed with cool features, pristine graphics and great fun.","It's the same experience of animal crossing but with a new crafting system that gives new possibilities to the franchise,I Hope it keeps improving.","Amazing, soothing, charming. Every element of this game makes me happy, and every little task (even the ones that need to be done every day) is fun or interesting! It\u2019s definitely a rewarding game, and much needed with the current state of the world.","The best game in the series ever. I love animal crossing so much, and this game but is the best.","Amazing graphics, gameplay, and more. A great spin on other classic animal crossing games, the characters are more full of life, and there's SO. MUCH. TO DO! The *only* reason this game is getting negative reviews is because people are mad about some of it's multiplayer features. But Nintendo made it clear how it was going to be, from the get-go","This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it  This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it This is the best game stop review bombing it  This is the best game stop review bombing it","Por este juego vale la pena comprarse una switch.

Everything about the game makes me love it more, the cute new villagers, building houses for them where I want !!!! and having so much power really is all I've wanted since I first played Wild World about 15 years ago","Imagine leaving a 0 or 1 star over one dumb thing. This game series has evolved so much since the previous ones and it has so many neat features that make the game great, such as dropping off multiple fossils at once and a lot of character customization options. And the graphics are amazing. You're all just a bunch of angry Karens","This is just the game the world needed. I could not be more grateful to Nintendo for bringing back their best series for disassociating weirdos like me at a time where we all could use a sunny vacation. Thank you.If you're out here being a little resetti about a switch not allowing more than one island per console? Guess what buttercup? The bloody GameCube did the EXACT SAME THING. GET OVER YOURSELVES AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Thanks, Nook Inc.","Their is so much too do, a really relaxing game. I purchased a seperate switch for my other half which would of been a more suitable idea anyway. The attention to detail really makes this game something special.","Es hermoso y lleno de vida , con un mont\u00f3n de cosas que hacer y sin fin simpre hay algo que  lograr, los detalles se cuidaron muy bien y la experiencia de convivi con tu familia y amigos desde una misma consola es lo que fomenta a planar las cosas que se pueden lograr.Desde la E3 se nos confirma una isla por consola y eso no fue novedad para mi por que es algo normal en la saga compartir el pueblo con otros 3 avatares o personas, pero el que puedas jugar al mismo tiempo con otra personan ayuda a facilitar ciertas tareas y hacen el d\u00eda m\u00e1s difrutables .La gente que lo tiene bien en claro sab\u00eda que si quer\u00eda ser individualista o compartir su isla con sus seres cercanos,  muchos tomaron la precauci\u00f3n de compar una consola antes o se esperaron a la edici\u00f3n especial y eso esta bien para unos y mal para otros, pero no es novedad tener que comprar otro consola para poder jugar otros t\u00edtulos multijugador con otra persona cercana a ti, como el caso de mosnter hunter, splatoon,  o pokemon por que no se pueden jugar de dos al mismo tiempo y mucho menos compartir la partida. Para mi este juego es perfecto y muy disfrutable , el ver hasta donde llega la gente con sus islas ser\u00e1 cosa del la imaginaci\u00f3n que tenga cada quien.","Everything I was hoping it would be. I never rate games but the butthurt review bombing inspired me to jump in and negate at least 1 of the angry manchildren reviews. Seriously though, it's embarrassing behavior.","Anima Crossing it's a very good game. only stupid people would put a 0 for silly things. Also many are bots","I love this game. My sister and I can play together or alone. We are constantly connecting together. I was also impressed that my sister and her boyfriend could play together too. They share their island but its fun they can play at the same time. The connection is amazing. It feels like a new game but it also feels like the game I've known and loved.","An amazing installment for the Animal Crossing Series. The game design and detail is amazing, the ability to edit so much of the island is great. They've added a lot of features, but they've taken some away. I've been playing since Gamecube, and it meets the AC formula and expands on it.These reviews I see about it needing to be more open world, in my opinion, would be against the Animal Crossing feel and design. It's not an RPG, it's a sim where you interact with the villagers and relax.The other reviews about people complaining how Nintendo is like EA are completely unjustified. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember on Gamecube if you wanted your own town, you had to get another memory card.  City Folk for the Wii was one town per Wii. I believe Wild World and New Leaf you may have had to just buy the game again, not sure about that one. However, it's always been pretty based around sharing a town if you share a console. I also don't have to pay to win. Nor is it a trash game with a amazing title slapped on it to make a grab for money(Battlefront).Objectives are just kind of there if you want to do them, they're handed to you as you play. Reviews are saying objectives aren't clear, but what's not clear about just living life on a island? There isn't really suppose to be a point to the game, you just get creative.I would wish that they would bring the art exhibit back to the museum, as well as the swimming mechanic from New Leaf. Other than that, amazing game. Brings back a lot of the same ideas from the Gamecube. Long Live Wisp!","I recommend for anyone seriously on the fence about buying this game to watch the directs. Spoil yourself. There is no story to Animal Crossing, no two playthroughs are alike, there is nothing to spoil. Research and make an informed decision. I share my switch  with two other adults, they work, I don\u2019t. Couch Co-op works fine. People are upset that Followers can\u2019t talk to villagers and doesn\u2019t have an inventory while in Co-op mode. You can still access the tools you already had and anything you pick up enters the box in town hall. Everything people are complaining about was stated in the Animal Crossing Direct and in other information outlets before preorders were made available, and with that knowledge the complaints seem pretty unwarranted. The game itself is very cute, very Animal Crossing, and very easy to pick up for new players. customization is more extensive than in any previous AC game, allowing for more unique experiences in the game. Online multiplayer is also super easy compared to New Leaf and I find my island has become a hangout hub for all the friends who\u2019ve visited. For fellow Time Lords, There is also notably no and I repeat NO consequence for Time Traveling, assuming you stop at every day on your journey, talk to every villager once per in-game day, Sell your turnips within the week you bought them in, and collect your bonus Nook Miles at the start of every day. I feel like a lot of NPCs who seemed a little bland in New Leaf have been revitalized in this entry (Blathers especially.) Many NPCs from past games are not present however; those who enjoyed City Folk\u2019s Cafe and were hoping for a return will be disappointed.Overall I can\u2019t get enough of this game. There are some choices I question, not bundling a certain Cutting Board recipe with the Ironwood Kitchenette, specifically, but it\u2019s a fun game nonetheless, and I recommend it to returning fans from previous AC games, or to people who don\u2019t even play games usually.","Great game very fun and relaxing. I enjoy visiting my friends towns and exchanging native fruits and crafting them recipes! So much to do and I could pour hours into this game. I cant wait to explore the other seasons and play the events that are to come! Grade A animal crossing game","This is my first full Animal Crossing game, having watched friends play since the first, and dabbling a tiny bit myself. I've been having the best time tending to my island and its residents. I like being able to play at my own pace, not feeling rushed to objectives, and just getting to relax. That being said, I have also had a very difficult time even putting the game down. Even if you have never played an Animal Crossing game before, I HIGHLY recommend checking this one out.","While attending high school I spent several hours in my town in Animal Crossing Wild World on the Nintendo DS Lite. Rather surprisingly I spent very few hours on Animal Crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. I\u2019ve always felt very strongly about linear games so it was to my great surprise and delight that the new horizons of Animal Crossing is a much structured experience and with progression that feels very natural.This new installment is an evolution and they have truly perfected an already polished formula. I have spent many hours on my island, and with countless hours more ahead of me. This is how a new installment in a franchise should be done - Development of an already established concept! 10/10","A fun game and a good way to put a new spin on an older franchise. Great evolution in the series and it made playing with other people a lot easier. Can not stop playing.\rAnd to all the review bombers... Even a bad amount of research would have told you everything you're complaining about MONTHS in advance. We already knew there was only one island per console and that you'd have to play with each other or have multiple consoles. Get over yourselves and learn to research a purchase before you throw money at things lol","One island per console is a \"design decision\" that is, at best, in poor taste, and at worst, straight-up predatory behavior.\r Per console, only one player gets to experience the game at its fullest. The other players see less dialogue, experience less events, and are locked out entirely from certain parts of the game.\r No matter how good a game is, I cannot stand behind a company that sees fit to make such decisions.","Have to share an island with family members with progression determined by the first person who loads up the game - instant 0/10","this game is incredibly boring and repetitive. Apparently the entire first day is just fishing and catching bugs. There is no reason to come back for a second day because the first day will suck so hard. Positive reviews are of this game or from people who hate video games and/or suffer from crippling anxiety and need the escape from their every day life. For anyone who actually likes video games, and enjoys their life, stay away. This will bore you to tears while you were waiting for the next horrific, repetitive, menial task for it to give you","Not being the primary player I am not able to do anything but fish and catch bugs. House is paid off and I have caught over 200 fish yet I still don't have a DIY recipe for a flimsy axe no matter how many times I talk to Tom.

The bad reviews are literally only about the whole no multiple island thing. Sure, it sucks if you want to share or whatever, but, honestly, giving it a 0 because your little brother can't have his own island? Kinda crazy..","I can\u00b4t believe we need two switch for a full game experience. I find okay the one island per console, but at least give both players the same opportunities, I can only hope this to change so i can finally play this game at 100% .","I was so excited for this but limiting the game to one island per switch has ruined this experience for me.","Secondary player can\u2019t do much.

You can't have multiple islands per console, hence there can only be one player who gets to do the \"story missions\" from Nook. Your online account is linked to the animal crossing user rather than to the switch user, so you can't have someone visit your island unless you are playing as the person who has an online account or unless you pay for multiple online accounts. Truly jaw droppingly anti consumer. Do yourself a favor and skip this wretch.","If you have kids you have to purchase another switch as you can only have one island making your 2nd on the game loosingnout in progressing and is more or less obsolete","The local multiplayer on this game is so badly designed it is a hate crime.

Thanks a lot who ever is responsible for the great idea of making all users on a switch play on the same island.","My brother received this game for his birthday and we were both super excited to have our islands but after he made his island we realized that it was only 1 island per switch, this is such a stupid, dumb, idiotic rule. Now my brother is the only one who can play the game and I'm stuck not being able to play. WOULD NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE!","To be honest, this is a great game. It's very laid back and destressing. I like everything about it, except one really big issue. I don't want to be an ordinary villager who can't do anything besides collecting and gathering stuff.  It really blows to be the second player. Nintendo, let us enjoy our very own island and give everyone in the household the full experience!","One island per console ruined the entire game for those who have to share the console.","Great looking game, wish I wasn\u2019t gated from doing anything as the second person to play it on the system. Another case of trash design on a great game.","I think I would like the game but I am unable to progress because my daughter has the primary character. So I am unable to get the full experience. It would be nice if there was a warning in the beginning. Then I would have set myself as the primary and then both of us would enjoy the game.","1 island PER CONSOLE with 1 player and up to 7 slaves (aka other players that cannot progress in the game) is a joke!You can\u2019t transfer data in any way to \u201cprevent cheating\u201d, which is as naive as it is harmful for anyone that found out the first paragraph the hard way or whose console may break.Multiplayer is a vast joke with one player being nothing more than a portable tool/slaveAlso be prepared for durability. Yes: tools break. A lot. Even the best ones break. This is by far the worst AC I\u2019ve played so far and the worst offender is: I was eager to play it. So was a lot of people, and Nintendo will probably only look at the sales","Had fun for the first few days. When my girlfriend wanted to start playing, we realized that she could not have her own island. Since neither of us wants to be \"player 2\", which would severely limit what you can do, I lost all interest and won't play again until we can create separate islands on the same console.","It\u2019s a great game but the switch is shared between my partner and I. He created an account first and created the island. I\u2019ve been more interested and put more hours in but can\u2019t progress unless he progresses first. Wish multiplayer was better and everyone could get the same game experience.","People saying that \"you can only have one island per switch\" are being too benevolent. In fact, you can only have one gameplay per switch! The first player/account to play will be the Resident Representative, meaning that he/she will have the full gameplay experience. Remaining player will not be able to: create an island, name an island, take part in the decisions (e.g. make buildings), invite NPC (e.g. Bladders). Basically, you can have one player per console, remaining ones are \"playable residents\". Nice touch Nintendo, specially given the time of release (covid19)","I bought this game for my wife and wanted to try it myself. The fact that I cannot have my own save on my own account is the stupidest decision ever! The 2nd rate citizen I am demoted to with no ability to modify the town eliminates the only reason I even wanted to play in the first place... Secondly, the cutscenes in the online play are infuriating! Every time someone comes or goes it plays a 30 second cutscene that you can't skip making it impossible to get anything done! Trying to leave someone's island took literally 20 minutes! I wouldn't spend $1 on this game knowing what I do now... Screw you Nintendo","The limitations on anyone other than the initial player are absolutely ridiculous.   This was a huge disappointment for me as my wife started the island (one island per switch) and I was left as an ancillary character when I joined in.   The game play looked fun when she was playing, such a shame.","Money-hungry nintendo ruined this game. Only one person getting the full experience is total **** i made an account just to give this review because i am so pissed.Totally took the joy of playing it out of my girlfriend and i. The whole thing for us is playing the game together, even if on different islands. Can not believe this isnt like EVERY other game ever made, where you can enjoy it the same way someone living with you can. Will be demanding a refund.","First: my  bad score is based on the fact that only ONE island can be used per console.\r My gameplay review is a lot better. I've only played it for a few days so still exploring but WOW, there are so many options to discover. I found myself playing every time for just 'one little bit more' and a few hours have passed. I really like the casual looks and simple gameplay. I haven't got a Nintendo Online membership but so far I don't really miss it. Maybe I will get one later on because of the nice options to visit other people's islands to get more exotic species of fruit etc.\rMy review would be a lot better if Nintendo would allow to have my other family members have their own island in stead of 'plundering' mine.\r If you play alone definetely buy one, if you have a famliy i would really reconsider unless you like to make really strict rules regarding playing on one island....","Bought as an escape from the quarantine blues and being stuck inside.Saw my son placing his tent on my island. Googled to find out there\u2019s only one island per console.So this is a game about living with people in a small space with limited resources due to that restriction. Because I haven\u2019t lived that enough for the last two months.What an absolute letdown. Deleted my save so my son could enjoy and I\u2019ll just enjoy the day to day drudgery of quarantine.Thanks for nothing, Nintendo.","This game is a shameless cash grab by Nintendo to sell more consoles. To get the full experience, a second cartridge won't work, you need to buy a whole new console. The first player experiences the full game, additional players get to see what the first player chooses to do.\r Nintendo did this knowing the game would be popular and could potentially boost console sales. They might not care about one customer, but I will not be purchasing another thing by Nintendo unless this gets fixed.","Zero zero zero...You can only have one island that all the profiles on the switch has to play on. That means no one can have their own island. Only one person (the one that owns the island) can make decisions. I bought the game expecting my daughter's to be able to make their own island and everyone can do their own thing..boy was I mistaken. Basic functionality is missing which is very surprising.","The fact that the game is limited to One Island per switch is complete BS and ruins the idea of using a switch as a Family Console. It's a complete Money grab on Nintendo's part, very disappointing. Until there is a fix for this, I wont keep supporting Nintendo.","Bought this game for my kids to play and I'm fuming that they can't each play on their own islands on their own account.  Each subsequent player is extremely limited by the first player and they get a watered down experience.  So dissappointed.","Only one island per console?????  That\u2019s not going over well with my kids and I\u2019m not about to buy each of them a switch simply so they can have their own islands to enjoy. Wish I could get a refund.","TL;DR\rThe game is not finished nor polished. it looks like a giant beta with lots of feature that Nintendo put in the game for testing, but are very limited. I'm convinced the team that developed AC:NH is not as skilled nor experienced in game design than the one who've done the previous games.\r This game is a deception:\r- One island per console. You want to play with your relatives? Buy a new console you pigeon!\r - The local multiplayer is simply awful: the current player is considered \"Master\" and the second player a \"Slave\". As a slave, you can do absolutely nothing. NOT EVEN OPEN YOUR OWN INVENTORY. The local multiplayer is basically useless.\r - The UI design is bad, really bad. You need to pass 3 dialog boxes minimum before even reaching the feature you want. Characters talk to say nothing, really.\r - The famous \"Characters are more intelligent now! They're aware with their environment\" is completely **** They're no real upgrade of the dialogue system, villagers end-ups saying the same thing over and over again. The environmental awareness basically adds one dialogue out of the 20s they have.\r - You don't get to choose you villagers. If you fall with a villager you don't want, you're screwed, as the mechanism behind a villager moving out is strange; nobody knows exactly how it works. For me, I had to wait 2 months for a specific villager, out of the 6 I don't wanted in my island, to go.\r - If one of your villager move out, you have only a day to find another you want. Otherwise, the game will automatically give you a random one, too bad if you don't want him \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\r - It 's been 3 month since the release of the game. The only update we had were about \"fixing stuff\" and reducing some insects spawn because player could make a lot of money with it (But they let people sell their villager for an insane amount of money; see what happened to Raymond, it's just disgusting), and adding characters that should've been in the initial release of the game (Redd and Leif).\r - The craft system is very basic. You can't even craft multiple object at once, or use materials stocked in your house directly in the craft system.\r - It seems there's less insects and fishes to capture. Gyroids have been completely removed from the game. You read that right.\r - The game has a \"story\" that you can reach in about 1-2 weeks (because the game makes you wait one day each time you progress). When you finally reached that goal, the credits play, and it feels like there's nothing else to do in the game. Because there's nothing else to do in the game.\r - There's even less interactions with Nook and Isabelle than the last game. I thought it would be time for Nintendo to let players know Isabelle and Nook better, but no.\r - Speaking of them, they do the daily announcements every time you launch the game. After the completion of the main goal of the game, Isabelle will, EVERYDAY, says that there's nothing to say, unless you have someone move in/out, or a special event.\rBasically, this feature is useless after spending 1-2 weeks in the game.\r - The RNG behind the crafting recipes is broken. It's like the game doesn't want you to learn new items to craft. For weeks I stumble upon the same crafting recipes everyday. This is even more infuriating when the recipe you earn is composed of other recipe you don't have.\r - The whole Island Terraformation was a great idea, but badly executed. You can only terraformate one cell at the time. Your island is about 100*100 cells. It'll take you days before you reach your terraformation goal.\r - Remember when you could invite villagers to your house? Forget that. It does not exist in this game.\r There's a lot of thing Nintendo could have done to polish the game. There's a lot of features that are missing from the previous games, a lot of characters that are missing too.\rThe game doesn't seem finished, nor polished in any way. In 3 months, we had ONE update with 2 characters that should've have been in the initial release of the game.\rNintendo doesn't seem to care. but since the game is one of the most sold game of all time on switch, I don't think they'll continue to update the game with new characters and upgraded features.\rThe hype killed the game.","It\u2019s absolutely appalling the design decisi\u00f3n from Nintendo not only making the one island per switch but also making only the first player the citizen representative. I was not the first player to start it up even though I bought it and now I\u2019m stuck in the story. There are people that say this has always been the case, well that does not mean it\u2019s right, it\u2019s greedy from Nintendo for trying to get me buy another switch for another familiar member. It\u2019s a household console, already expensive in this time of crisis but also the game is expensive too, we do not live in a chocolate world. This feature has completely ruined the game for me, if animal crossing is a great game well then that\u2019s a game that\u2019s unplayable for me.","The game is almost perfect! I must say that the only flaw is really the fact that you can only have one island, (many review bomb confirm that) but other thant that, the game is perfect! Can't wait to put 100 more hours in it!","So far of what I played, I don\u2019t think it deserves all the hate it gets, however some of the problems especially early on can be a huge dealbreaker to some such as 1 island per user, co-op, and the fact that it starts off super slowly, which could turn off new fans. Also why do you get hourly music later in the game? Hearing the same track for the whole day gets really irritating. Also I don\u2019t really like the piece of music, but that is a me problem. Hopefully Nintendo listens and fixes some of these issues. Overall, I highly recommend this game. Gorgeous graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and the amazing charm the series is best known for.","As a first timer to the animal crossing series, it was a bit hard to get into at first, but i really enjoy it now. The music, the graphics, the vibe, it's all so relaxing. The only downside i can think of now is the crazy amount of dialogue you can't skip. Great game! Can't wait to play in other seasons!","You can have 8 players to a town but only the first one is able to do everything. All other players are second-class residents","I created a metacritic account for the sole purpose of expressing my disappointment in this game. It'd be a 10 for the single player game, but the terrible way they handled multiplayer ruins it. I let my wife take the lead, only to find I can't progress. Plus, playing at the same time with local coop is a joke. I'd rather sit back and watch someone else play. Like others have pointed out, this is a blatant and disappointing money grab by Nintendo.","Only one island per switch makes me mad. I wanted to play the game but Nintendo said \"Naw fam\".","Multiplayer:Claiming the game is \"co-op\" is basically a joke. If you aren't the first person to start the game you are essentially useless and every functionality is locked out. You have to wait for the original player to advance the story if you want anything to happen or change. Now if player one decides to take a break from the game or isn't able to play for a while you have no option but to wait for them. I hope you didn't buy this game for the sole purpose of playing multiplayer like I did.Game content:The island feels pretty small when you first start out. The island we chose had very little starting space. The tutorial is fairly long for how simple the mechanics are. Second player and up will progress through the opening a lot faster. The game is cute as always but fairly bland. Tldr: Multiplayer is horrible and there isn't really much to redeem the game.","Pre-ordered, waited....got the game, let my son go first...finally got to play, only to find out I'm a glorified NPC.  My son is enjoying the game and from what little I could actually do in the game it looks like it could be fun to play if you are the only one in your household.  This is ridiculous, I have been a long time customer but this will be the last time I purchase Nintendo games unless they fix this issue.  In this day and age and state of the world, no one needs to feel like a second class citizen while playing a GAME.  PLEASE FIX THIS!","Was so looking forward to starting my own island but you know I\u2019m a secondary account so I don\u2019t matter to Nintendo and the only way to matter is to buy another switch, yay.","One island per switch, I have 2 kids that want to play, caused nothing but fighting so far..","Me and my wife are having to share an island. We cant even cart swap like you used to","Gameplay is completely broken having only one island per switch. It makes no sense at all. Multiple people on the same switch destroy the experience.","Absolutely ridiculous that they limit players so that only one person can play. We have a large family, and we can\u2019t even buy additional copies to play because it\u2019s locked per Nintendo Switch console. I hope they do something to address this.","If you plan on playing this game across multiple accounts on one switch your progress will be gated based on the progress of the 1st account to play the game on your console. This is without warning and nothing in the game advises you of this.This killed all hype I have for this game as I've wasted so much time trying to craft an axe when I can't even unlock the recipe. I refuse to restart this game unless island reps can be appointed dynamically or so.e other workaround/fix is implemented.","Only one island per console is scummy, but not deal breaking on its own. You can't even buy a second copy of the game, you literally have to buy a second Switch. That is more scummy than pretty much anything I've seen in gaming before.\r However, despite the scummy decision, I wasn't planning on having more than one island anyways, so it's not a deal-breaker. What is a deal-breaker for me is that there's only one First Resident per island, and pretty much everything is locked off for anyone who isn't a First Resident. This, in combination the SCUMMY practice I mentioned before, is why the game deserves a 0 in its current state. I've never felt so betrayed by a company before and I bought Fallout 76.","Ive been excited about New horizons for a long time. I was equally excited to share the island with my wife and enjoy what content was offered. Then I realized the limitations of being \"player 2\". While my wife gets to enjoy unlocking all the content,  getting all the resources and recipes, and learning about the game from a very nice tutorial, im left to only mess with what little repeatable content there is to do.\r The only meaningful things i can do is gather resources and give them to the person who is the main character to progress their story.Im no longer involved in the gameplay, and pretty much cast out to do nothing other than work on my house.  This is not animal crossing to me, even if i share a console with another player i shouldnt be relegated to playing a gimped minecraft.\r Forcing me to pay for another switch CONSOLE to get my own island to play is not acceptable in the least and should addressed as the most important issue IMMEDIATELY.  Until then i give a score for what its like to be player 2. There is nothing to do so its a 0","Cooperative play becomes competitive. People either have to fight to get to the console first in order to play in a manner that pushes the story forward, or you have to manipulate the time/date to be able to have the resources available to you.  Poor choices; bad call, Nintendo","Really wanted to enjoy this game with my family but the one island per console is extremely limiting. The real spoiler is that only the first person to play (the island leader) is the only one who can advance the game for everyone else. If you live alone or are the only one who plans to play on the switch this is a non-issue. For those who plan to play with family or friends on the same switch it is extremely limiting factor and makes progress dependent on the first one who played.","Nintendo is the Disney of video games. They are incredibly greedy and refuse to work with their fan-base. One island PER SWITCH? No. Money grubbing and asinine. If you're looking for another reason not to buy it, loading times in multiplayer are absurd. Every single time someone comes to/leaves from an island, everyone gets a 90 second loading screen.","Just found out that I can't actually enjoy any of this game's features, simply because my wife logged in first. This is the worst game design ever - fix this Nintendo!","Nintendo did this to themselves. Noone should need to buy a new console just to have another save state on a game. It would be a 10 if they thought of the customer for once.","The user score is almost ridiculous. Sure I understood the problem, and the \"1 island blah blah\" is a bad thing I agree, but could u make a REAL review and speak about the WHOLE game too? Because it is amazing and doesn't deserve a 0 or 1 at all, that's a fact. It is beautiful, charming, cute, colorful, full of old and new features. Clearly the best Animal Crossing game in my opinion, you can do so many things and I'm having a really good time with it and with my friends. And did you go to the museum?! It is incredible, damn! I give the game a 9/10 for sure, but 10/10 is for counterbalance a lot of stupid rates ;)","I'm very dissapoined that you can only have one island per switch.. Hopeless decision, that is consumer super-unfriendly.","Nice game, really relaxed. I love the real time day and night cyclus, and weather.","Incre\u00edblemente viciador, tendr\u00e9 que comprar otra copia porque me lo han quitado. Recomendado para los que buscan un juego para pasar la tarde r\u00e1pido, no tiene dificultad alguna, solo es jugar, jugar y jugar.","I share a Switch with my fianc\u00e9e and we bought this game knowing about the co-op and single-island-per-console restrictions, but we were naive about just how much these restrictions would affect gameplay. In every possible way, Nintendo has designed this game to be a single-player experience. Just sharing the same island sounded bearable, but it turns out that EVERYTHING in this game has to be shared, zero-sum style. All the daily spawning resources? Only one player can take advantage of them per day. All the first-time awards for donating or developing the island? Only one player get the rewards. If one player happens to play the game more often than any other sharing the same console, there will be very little gameplay left to enjoy for the others. Nintendo has done this purposefully, betting that the pain inflicted on the players would be enough to justify buying more hardware and game copies. In our case, it has just soured us on their brand. Shame.","I love it. With every day the game getting better. The long waiting has now ended ^^","Although the game has only been out for three days so far, I can thoroughly say this has brought me so much joy. As a long time fan I can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series. The big pros introduced in this game that I see clearly are the introduction of crafting, innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration, and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced. There are many other pros too, such as character customization, the beauty of the game (especially seen in the museum), etc. However, the game does have flaws. The tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it should, which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting  materials ever used. This makes it feel very monotonous to craft things, as it would require more resources than your small island can provide, which leads you to go to other islands (Using Nook Ticket) to get resources, which can become very tedious and somewhat too easy after your first few times. The game\u2019s pacing feels extremely slow compared to other Animal Crossing games, which does hurt when you are so limited in the beginning. Other criticisms such as it lacking gyroids (present since AC:Population Growing) being missing, a somewhat lacking roster of new villagers, fish and bugs feeling too easy to catch now, and the dreaded 1 island per console issue do bring the game down however. One criticism I don\u2019t believe is valid is the introduction of holidays through updates, as they would be added by the time normal players would get there thus the only people who would complain is the time travelers, which is debatable if that\u2019s cheating or not. Overall, I believe this is a great evolution of the animal crossing formula, with many small flaws that are common across franchises when such a large gap is between entries which is to be expected. I would recommend this game to any previous Animal Crossing fan and anyone wanting to come into the franchise for the first time.","Great game; I just wish you could have multiple islands. I can just play the game for hours, doing nothing without getting bored.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is everything Animal Crossing and more. Whether you want to have a calming experience, have fun time messing around with friends, grind for bells and collectables, or make an emotional connection with wholesome virtual animals, it will deliver a 10/10 experience.\r This game makes you look forward to wake up in the next morning.","Been playing since the day of release and I have to say, it's a truly amazing game. There's new things to do everyday. The game is beautiful, graphics are amazing.I specifically enjoy that the game takes a longer time than normal games to 'complete'. This makes it seem more worth it, you can play for longer without having nothing to do.Regarding the multiplayer, I have tested playing via online and local play (not on the same switch) and the experience was really fun. Just as a notice to anyone who only has one switch, you can only have one island.Gameplay is incredible. Costumization is amazing! Overall 10/10","Fantastic game! If I could rate it higher I would, improves upon previous animal crossing systems in every way. It's a ridiculously calming, stress free way to blow through multiple afternoons and the level of customization that eventually comes to your island is astounding!","Firstly, i would like to say, this is a game I would totally give a 9 or a 10 if it weren't for some HUGE issues. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a FANTASTIC single player experience and is the best game in the installment by far. The game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole. Now, instead of catching bugs, fishing, and gathering fruit to sell to buy items, you can make your own tools and furniture. Another great addition this game has is the deserted islands you can visit. You are allowed to visit small, deserted islands and gather as many resources there as you can hold to bring back to your island. This helps lower the time it takes to gather enough resources to build a new building or upgrade an old one. Nook Miles is a new addition as well - a currency that you get just by doing things like catching bugs, chopping down trees, and selling items for bells! This makes doing simple little things rewarded. Nook Miles Plus allows you to do simple tasks like catch 5 bugs and then adds a new one right away for you to complete. Here's the main issue with the game - for each copy of Animal Crossing you own, you can only have ONE ISLAND. This would be fine if it were just yourself playing, but other players can't have their own experience AND can't do a lot of things in the game if they don't own the island. Even if you have 2 Nintendo Switches, you can only have one island per copy of Animal Crossing you own. This makes the game so much less enjoyable for other players for no reason - Nintendo could have EASILY allowed for multiple saves. In addition to that, islands can't bew recovered via Nintendo Switch Online which was a major selling point of NSO - backups. Nintendo will recover your island up to one time if you get a new system or break your old one, but after that, you are on your own. I wish Nintendo would fix these issues, because if they did, this game would be nearly perfect. Still, if you don't plan on breaking your Switch and aren't playing with anyone else, I can't reccomend this game enough.","This game is incredible. So beautiful, more than ever to do, well paced. The amount of polish alone in this game would be enough for this 10 but add in the fact that it's fun, rewarding and just lets you escape into a world of beauty and serenity. It's a game for the ages. I understand there are users talking about the inability to make island progress without the work of the initial player on the island, but that system does make sense to me in some ways and they very well may fix it in a patch if that is a concern of yours. I feel for those who are in that situation but I believe the game is good enough to deserve much better than it's getting for one multiplayer system that they did not advertise quite how it works.","I'd like to be clear before I go any further, I have not played this game myself. I have only seen, roughly, ten minutes of gameplay over my girlfriends shoulder. Periodically, I check to see what it is she's giggling at, or smiling uncontrollably about. Those reasons alone, warrant a ten in my book, but my girlfriends enjoyment aren't the only reasons why I give this game a ten. I give this game a ten because, for the first time in a long time, it's quiet. My girlfriend is happy, amused, and distracted; all the while, I am free to my heart's content. Thank you Animal Crossing, so **** much.","Fix multiplayer and I will rate this a 10/10 because otherwise I love this game!!!!","I've been playing for a couple of days and while i honestly thought it was a 9, i soon realized my sister as player 2 wasn't really able to do anything fun in the game and that really sucked out all the enjoyment I had with the game. Being able to have fun alone is no fun at all. I really hope Nintendo fixes this as the one island per console policy is incredibly unnecessary.","Do not purchase if you intend to play with multiple players. Only the first child can progress the game or basically do anything on the island. No way for multiple islands. Kids in tears, what a mess. Absolutely moronic decision by the designers to not allow more than one player per game. Unfortunately bought from the Nintendo online shop so can\u2019t return the game. DO NOT PURCHASE. I Want to throw the switch out the window. Will sell the stupid thing once ps5 is released.","After playing for a week, I realized I have more fun with New Leaf. New Horizons has bafflingly removed core features that were present in New Leaf, and the pacing of progression feels artificially slowed down to hide the lack content. This is coming from an AC veteran who knows what's missing and also knows what a more fun pacing for this type of game feels like. The customization is deeper and far more fleshed out, but this feels like it was at the expense of some gameplay features. While relaxing and charming, if you want the purest core AC experience, dig up a 3DS and get New Leaf.That would be my 7 star review. But here's the kicker.  Reviewers haven't discussed this because they tend to not share their consoles with a family. As a single player I am having a good time with the game, but the inability to allow multiple users their own islands is moronic, greedy, and especially cruel to low income households.As such I have put my score at 0 to help send a message to Nintendo. Be kind to families. Especially during a time like this, while a worldwide pandemic threatens everyone's normal life. Fix this, Nintendo, and I'll adjust my score.","Do not buy this game if more than one person wants to play on the same Nintendo Switch. The first person (1P) to start the game is the only person who can advance and actually play the story. Anyone else playing is a limited resident, they can\u2019t even help out with the main story objectives. If you\u2019re not the 1P, you won\u2019t get as much access to getting Nook Miles, opportunities, or DIYs and you lack a lot of experience/fun that the 1P gets. Having to share a island is kinda fun, but when other people can\u2019t contribute near as much as the 1P it\u2019s unfair. The multiplayer mode is awful too. It\u2019s a leader/follower style so if you\u2019re the follower, you can\u2019t access your inventory, collect things to your inventory, or travel together. I don\u2019t understand the point of multiplayer when the other players can\u2019t do much.Both players should equally get to play normally on multiplayer. Also, if you happen to lose or damage your switch, your game is gone for good because there\u2019s no backup save or ability to transfer data.","Giving this a 2 until something is changed about some major aspects of the game. I love animal crossing, and bought New Horizons with the intention of playing it, and getting my fianc\u00e9 into the game since she's never played. Soon after we discovered that she can't have her own island, make progress, or contribute to goals whatsoever since I launched the game first. She was excited to play the game, but now she's just sad and disappointed that she can't An option when starting the game on her profile should have come up. \"Would you like to play your own save on your own island, or would you like to be a glorified visitor?\" The other complaint that I have is that the online functionality requires you and everyone on your island to stop what you're doing and spend the next minute watching the person arrive or leave. You can't do anything while its going on and you have to watch it. Totally slows down and puts a massive break in the flow every time. Other than that I've mostly enjoyed the game. Just wish the multiplayer made more sense, and the multiple user profiles were individual.","Each person in our family needs their own island. What a let down. We would happily buy an additional game, but a needing a second console is ridiculous.","The multiplayer limitation is absolutely unacceptable without clear warning.","1. Only one island per Switch. That seriously sucks, but isn't the end of the world.\r2. Only the \"Resident Manager\" (first player to start the game) can progress the story. This doesn't jive with #1.\r3. Tools break. Fine. Fishing rods break. Okay... Watering cans break. Wait what?\r4. Cannot create multiple tools at once. This doesn't jive with #3.\r5. A little confirmation and animation plays for every single thing that's made. This doesn't jive with #4.\r6. Flowers need to be dug up now in order to be moved, using a shovel that, oh boy, it breaks. Again this would be more acceptable if it weren't for #5 and #4, but now it's just a pain in the ass.\r7. You can cross rivers using a stick! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.\r8. You can climb cliffs using a ladder! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.\r This game is a goddamn chore to play after the first day or two. This is mostly due to the new DIY mechanic and the ungodly amount of steps required to gather materials, make tools that break in 5-10 minutes of use, traverse the terrain, etc. Are chores fun? Not normally, no, but the professional reviewers seem to think chores are a blessing. This game, unlike previous titles in the franchise, feels like a tedious chore. Do you like chores?\r And hoo boy that friend visiting wait time, good god. 1-2 minutes of waiting, when downloading the data of a friend's island would take, at most, 2-3 seconds on any halfway-decent connection. Why was this added? It's fine to see once, but every single time? Five friends visiting each other's islands will lead to everyone waiting for at least 25 minutes in total, sitting there, doing absolutely nothing. It blows my mind that somebody thought \"Hell yeah, great idea, let's make them wait more.\"","The fact that there can only be one island per switch. I let my little sister play the game before me cause she was excited and when I began to play I wasn't able to progress the game. It's unacceptable.","Only one person on a switch can experience what the game has to offer? What cruddy industry has to stoop this low for money. They screwed themselves with this","Disgusting limits on a single switch. Do not buy until they address it. You CANNOT PROGRESS until the first player do too sign in does. 60$ for that? Really?","I wanted to like this game so much... but it has severe issues, enough to make it unplayable, to make a full review of the issues without spoiling even a thing.  Well, here is the first issue. You can only have one save game, one save slot, one island  in the entire console. You are forced to share the island with the other users  playing in your console. You change something in there, amd it will change for everyone on that console as well.  A bit crappy, because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable. Except its not. Because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game, is a \"leader\" that consists of granting progression lock to all other users. What do i mean? It means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game, no one else can ...  it hears like a joke, like, havent you thought the leader player could just abandon the game and force everyone to get stuck? Or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users? This game seems promising, but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really, who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game, and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game? Yeah, because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first. And yes, you guessed it, there is no way to change this \"leader player\" unless you delete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed. Too many issues to be enjoyed just by a fatal saving system that nobody likes or understands why it was made that way.","You can only have 1 island, I repeat, 1 island per console. Got a wife or husband that wants their own save file like EVERY OTHER GAME IN EXISTENCE. Nope! Got kids.... You better shell out for another whole console. Gameplay is irrelevant in light of these oversights. Getting my $60 back.","I'm unable to play full game cause my sister started playing first. I cannot improve our island. It feels like playing some kind of demo version. The game can only be recommended for people who live alone and want to play alone. It doesn't work for families.","giving this such a low review does not feel right, but i personally feel that it is only fair.i feel that nintendo hasn't put much thought into the fact that the switch is a console which has multiple profiles, also siblings tend not to want to share saves which will lead to arguments. to make all of this worse even though up to 8 players can play on one island only one of those 8 ( the first player to begin the game) can actually do anything of significance. It would seem little less harsh if the game was linked to a cartridge or digital copy even so then this seems very anti-consumer. I cant see what would be so bad about adding seperate user game saves","One island per console...wow, great idea. Thanks a lot Nintendo, really appreciate it.","I can\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t have my own island. My roommate gets to do all these fun things, progress the island, access tons more diy recipes, make important decisions, and all I get to do is collect bugs and plant flowers. When I tried being collaborative with my roommate, all I could do was hand over materials I harvested like a slave so she could make cool things. I get so angry watching her play it. Games shouldn\u2019t be made like this. I shouldn\u2019t have to get my own console. This game is utterly crap. Worst decision ever.","Excellent game outside of the *enormous* issue that is the limitation to a single island per console. This is not only infuriating and completely unprecedented, but also an entirely unnecessary constraint. Furthermore, the progress on said island is hugely dependent on the individual that created it, and the others on the island are severely limited based on what the original creator has and hasn't yet done. Cannot give this game the good score it deserves in light of this issue - Nintendo needs to fix this immediately. On the bright side, EA finally has a competitor for greediest video game company of the year!","Great game, its super chill and addictive good job nintendo. The multiplayer is where it gets complicated. Players can only own 1 island per switch. So the console isnt a family system anymore. It becomes a 400$ personal console. They made it so other accounts on one switch can play on the same island but that player cant do much apart from fsrming the resources which is ridiculous. This feature may as well not exist. I really hope nintendo can get the family focused view they once had. Because this really sucks for every household that bought the game thinking they were going to be able to compare islands...Cheap shot nintendo. Really","Love the game its so cute! HOWEVER. We are a family of 4 and were very disappointed to find out we can each have our own save file....only one person can have an \"island\" and advance the story. My two kids were very disappointed to find this out. Read online that you cant even buy multiple copies of the game to fix this ):","While this is a lovely game to play while in isolation, it is absolutely terrible if you have even just two people per household who want to play it. Not everyone can afford to have multiple switches per household. Nintendo dropped the ball in regards to multiplayer use on a single switch. My brother and I went 50/50 on buying this game and because he made his character first, I have been reduced to a secondary character that cannot assist in major island development, even though I spend more time playing than him. It\u2019s quite frustrating. I would love to give this game a wonderful review but I simply cannot.","You can only make one town per console? Even though I purchased 3 seperate copies of the game? I bought a copy of the game for my son, my wife, and myself, and all three of them will have the same town. Thank God I read the paragraph-long disclaimer on the back of the box before opening the shrink wrap.","I bought this game for my partner and I as we were both fans of the game when we were younger and fancied some nostalgia to get us through lockdown. Being the gentleman that I am I let her go first, however, I didn\u2019t realise this would have lasting consequences from what I can only see as the full game experience. As a player 2 profile (even though I bought the **** game) I cannot progress, at all. All of the island progress features, only the first profile who opens the game is able to make any sort of progress. For me, it has ruined the whole experience. Nintendo have literally **** so many people here and I am one of them. **** me did this game not go through any rigorous testing, I mean, any sane person would surely shoot this design down. Awful awful stuff. Updated needed ASPA to correct this cluster****. Nintendo deserve all these awful reviews for ruining the experience for many fans, including myself. I can understand why ratings from critics were high (lone experience) but for most of us working class folk, one switch per household is all we can afford. Plus \u00a350 for the game itself, which I bought, and now am completely restricted to gaining the full experience.****","Extremely disappointing for a family household. My partner is the only person who can do any of the interesting factors of the game. This ruins the experience for anyone else.","By far the most anticipated game for the year that I was waiting for. Could not wait to experiance it with my daughter. Good thing I let her start first. She is loving it. As for me, there is zero reason for me to play at all. Never mind I am the one that paid for it all. One island and one player for progression period is less antiquated as it is an obvious greed grab to try to sell another console for each household. That is not going to happen. I pumped up Nintendo like crazy to everyone I know this year and now I feel betrayed. I won't make that mistake anymore. Going back to Stadia and Xbox.","I just want to share an island equally with my significant other. What's the point in playing now?","I wouldn't have purchased this game if I had known there was only 1 Island per console.","Let me change the resident representative, Nintendo ! Stop money grabbing and trying to make us buy another $300 console and $60 game, and warn people before they start their save file","This game would be perfect if your the island rep. Everyone else gets to play the f2p version...","Apart from what the other users have to say about this game being frustrating as a second player, Animal Crossing: New Horizons evokes a very real anxiety during this time of isolation. With only one island and limited resources, this game is more reflective of quarantine than island life. In a time when you have no control, playing New Horizons as the second player is amplified by the limited choices and control of \u201cyour\u201d island.","Spoiler alert, can't be played by two players on the same island on the same switch. Everything the second player does or picks up vanishes.","Very limited multiplayer play unless you own two consoles.  the loading screen for multiplayer is so annoying and long","Had lots of fun with it for first 2 days. But it's a super slow game after that. Got to the point where i enter game, pay off loan and quit for the day. Don't know if its gonna pick up after but i don't fell like it.","This game epitomizes Nintendo\u2019s anti consumerism. The ways this game goes about save files and local multiplayer is archaic and ridiculous. Nintendo purposely limits any additional player in ways that force people into purchasing multiple switches if they would like to enjoy the game with another person. As an additional player you are limited to being basically useless. Nintendo has also limited the player to a single Island save file per switch, with no cloud saves or file transfer. If you own two switches, Too bad. If you share a console and want to have separate islands. Too bad. If you want to enjoy the game with a family member, partner, or friend on a single console. Too bad. There is not a single technical limitation to create the major flaws of this game. The issue is Nintendo\u2019s greed and desire to take advantage of their blindly loyal fanbase. Nintendo is the EA of the first party and should be treated as such. Don\u2019t let Nintendo spit in your face. Don\u2019t buy New Horizons.","Full experience for all players. It's not a cheap game every household deserves a whole game.","My review is based on the fact that I just happened to create my account after a 1st player. A 1st player's review may be totally different. As a 2nd player, you are required to sort of be a 2nd class citizen of the island. It's almost like you are living the life of one of the NPC villagers. You're unable to fully experience the whole \"start an island from the ground up\" thing the game was touting. Nope. Only 1st player can do that. You are hindered until they decided (and only they decide) how the game advances in any meaningful way. This is ridiculous game design.","I have never left a game review but I made an account just to leave one for this game. Only having one island per switch is dumb but I can deal with it. Not being able to progress as the secondary player is ridiculous. Greedy Nintendo at it again. I'm sure there's people stupid enough to buy a second switch AND game just to be able to fully play with another person.","Have been in the animal crossing fandom since the gamecube release. Me and my boyfriend bought a switch two years ago for the sole purpose of having a console to play on should they release a new animal crossing. When it was finally announced we were thrilled, mostly thrilled for multiplayer as we had always had to play at separate times in the past. This is not a multiplayer game. Only the leader gets access to normal features of the game, and you have to frequently switch out to get anything accomplished. You can\u2019t fish at the same time because not enough fish spawn when there are two players, so you must take turns and decide who will catch what. Not only that, but I later learned that because my boyfriend was the first player to create an account, he would be the only one to get complete access to all gameplay. This means for any exciting developments, I had to wait for him to get on and get them done for me. As someone who plays more often, this is not too great for me. I love the game and the new features they have included, but it seems like they designed this game so you would absolutely have to purchase a second console and second copy just to get the full experience you were intended. I\u2019m very sad as me and my boyfriend essentially have to fight over who will be the leader and it creates the opposite of a smooth playing experience. Really hoping that Nintendo decides to add some changes in the future. Even a split screen play would be better than what they have decided to implement. Great game, if you\u2019re the only one in your household playing.","I want second island!! For my kidsWhy nintendo?? Whyyyyyy?? 3ds i got 3 copies...","While the game is good from what I've seen and looks like fun, only being allowed one island per console is a deal breaker for me. All players should be able to have the same experience, but this isn't possible because only the first player has any creative control over the island.\r AC is finally on a console that allows multiple user profiles, but those don't make a darn bit of difference with this game. Nice cash grab, Nintendo. We won't buy another Animal Crossing game.","It a solo game.Coop is non existent the second player can't access inventory, loot goes to community trash bin, you can't talk or interact with people.If the second player play solo. He's set on the first player islan, and sont t'\u00e9crive any qu'est. It mean th\u00e9 game Can only b\u00e9 player vu th\u00e9 first player. Dont SAY ITS A COOP GAME HAD YOU TEST YOUR OWN GAME HAVE YOU FIND IT FUN TO BE THE DECOND PLAYER ?","One island per console is the must dumb and greedy thing I ever saw. It is the first time ever that I am strongly thinking about returning a Nintendo game. It is such a simple solution: when I enter the game I could choose between a new island for my profile or join another profile's island. That is very stupid and I am crazy disappointed.\r This is obviously a material for a class action lawsuit. Imagine if Microsoft or Apple released a new operational system that the second user cannot open the browser. It is just crazy!","Too many downsides make it not worth the price and a major downgrade from past animal crossing games. It's 2020 already. It is unacceptable that Nintendo still does not do multiple savers per game and offer cloud save services. they need to get out of the past already!\r pros: cute graphics\r cons:\rONLY ONE TOWN PER GAME. GET OUT OF THE PAST NINTENDO-- LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME COMPANY ON THIS PLANET HAS BESIDES YOU!\r No cloud saves (so wait, we just need to waste years on a game with no way to back it up? wait for their low powered console to break?  hahahah how about no)\r can't split items stacks\rcan't bulk craft\rtools break too quickly\r gold tools are not worth unlocking or crafting! they break too. What's the frikkin point of unlocking them then? there's isn't one! what is it with nintendo and breakable crap anyway? breath of the wild had this stupid problem too. Nintendo just doesn't learn. Shocker.\r no paintings, gracy, etc\r only 5 catalog items can be bought a day (lol wut)\r \"mystery\" islands are boring. it's the same island with slightly different layout every time lol. the chance of seeing anything else is slim to none! Not worth it.","I honestly cannot recommend this to any household that has multiple children or others who want to experience the same joy from this game.\rFor being lousy to consumers with save file restrictions that are meant to pressure people to buy multiple consoles per household, this game gets a 0.","UPDATE: we just unlocked terraforming, and it looks like this is another feature that player 2 misses out on. I don\u2019t even care that I share an island with my bf, but the fact I can\u2019t make any impactful changes to how the island looks sucks - I was really looking forward to creating a beautiful island but all I can do is plant flowers &amp; trees. I can\u2019t make pathways, bridges or terraform at all. I can\u2019t understand why Nintendo has done this Like many others here, I\u2019m really disappointed by the restrictions of player 2/ any player that isn\u2019t the founder. Me and my bf got this game to play together but soon found out player 2 can\u2019t make any executive decisions, doesn\u2019t have access to any of the quests, can\u2019t place buildings/infrastructure, and ultimately misses out on a lot of the story. This sucks!! It means one of us misses out on the full experience of the game. This is unfortunately not rectified by the option for co-op play, which is just a joke. Co-op works by having one \u2018leader\u2019 that can play as normal, and then the \u2018followers\u2019. The followers can\u2019t access their tool wheel, inventory or leave the same screen as the leader, which just results in really boring gameplay. The follower is just essentially reduced to being a pack mule for the leader, and unable to really contribute in any way, as it takes so long to cycle through your tools to really be able to do anything. It sucks because it would\u2019ve been SO fun to play together co-op, but Nintendo really missed the mark with these limitations. The only work around is to get a new switch and second copy of the game, which is ridiculous! It\u2019s such a shame because playing the game solo has been really great, but the fact that you have to buy multiple consoles for everyone to get the full experience of the game is just terrible, and for that i can\u2019t justify giving this game a good rating","My children were very interested in this game. My husband and I had never played any of the old versions of Animal Crossing. When I bought the game I was happy to see it was multiplayer m, up to 4 players. Seemed like a great family game. My 7 year old, jumped right in, made his island, gave it a silly name, made his avatar, started playing. He loves it. Then my 9 year old tried it. And we quickly learned that he could not make an island. He was devastated, as he\u2019d really wanted the game, too. He has no interest in playing as a minor character in what\u2019s now his brothers game. Multiplayer is useless too. It\u2019s not even split screen. I really hope Nintendo fixes this.","So done with Nintendo, will never buy their overpriced, anti consumer garbage products ever again. Locked to only one island per console, a shameful and greedy attempt to sell more switches by Nintendo.","First things first: sing the petition to don't restrict the number of islands per console:  http://chng.it/Bz2kfWTc4y.Apparently, Nintendo is still in 1997. One island per console is one of the most disgusting things I have seen in the game industries. It completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch, not to mention no cloud saves, and no way to transfer data to other system. And it doesn't make sense in absolutely any point of view. If you share a switch, DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you are okay with sharing resource, no tutorials for the second one to play, and a billion things more","Two players sharing a Switch is a nightmare. Only one island per switch is allowed, and on top of that, the second person to create their character has basically no autonomy in the game's quests and storyline.Some folks can't afford a Switch for everyone in the house. If the console has multiplayer capabilities, so should the game. Nintendo knows how to do this, it's plain ol greed thats stopping them.","Overall a great game so far but every player should be able to create unlimited islands! At least one for every local player.","I'd like to get into the meat of the game, but I can't get past the extremely stupid decision to limit one island per Switch. PER SWITCH. I haven't gotten into an Animal Crossing game since the GameCube version, which didn't have this limitation. It's typical Nintendo; for anything they do right, they have to do something wrong to balance it out.\r If you plan on only playing one-player, you're probably fine. But for anyone in a household with one Switch and multiple players, you're in for a bad time.","The game is okay for me, except for some frustrating mechanics and painfully slow menu screens and loading times.  However, this game just shafts my gf, who I'm playing couch co-op with.  She has no access to island advancements, and is missing all storyline diy recipes - which is a lot.  It's a shame Nintendo came out with such an unfinished multiplayer - it seems like it was an afterthought.","I was really looking forward to this game.\r However, there is one terrible and well documented caveat: ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH.\r The year is 2020 AD, and Nintendo who claims to be the most family-friendly console in existence has made a terrible decision fueled by their corporate greed. I wanted my wife to play this game too--but she can't because she'll be a glorified second class citizen of my personally created island and will be unable to make her own full progress and island creations unless we purchase another switch exclusively for her to play, plus another copy of the game.\r I continue to question how people are not as bothered by this as they should be. The level of greed in this company has officially reached EA levels. Imagine, being a parent and having 3 kids who share one switch--guess what? They're screwed because kids aren't known for being agreeable; messing with another kid's landscape, or building in places where another kid may not want structures, the list goes on and on.\r Nintendo fanboys will defend this decision (that was made in the interests of their corporate overlords; not for them, or you, or me) as \"normal\" in the animal crossing universe or as an overreaction by those affected by it. Guys, these are legitimate concerns and perfectly good reasons to be angry! I cannot think of another game that requires me to purchase another console if I want to share it with my household; because that's the reason console profiles are a thing since last gen consoles.\r It is highly unlikely Nintendo will remedy this ridiculous situation. However, it is 100% fair for people to express their disdain by using this platform to voice their reasons for giving the game a 0. Our complaints are just as legitimate as the \"critic reviews\" who gave this game a 10 (despite the obvious limitation at hand which seems suspect, maybe those reviews are paid, who knows?), as well as voting with their wallets--for some however, it is impossible to vote with their wallets if they've already purchased the game and have no recourse for a refund (which is pretty much everyone).\r That's okay, Nintendo is crying/laughing about this on their way to the bank and they know they can get away with this because you will gladly take Nintendo's virtual spit in the face and thank them for it.","I want to play this game very much but won't pay 80 CAD / 60 USD for a limited game that I can not fully play with my husband unless I buy another console and another copy of the game. It is just too much.","It would be a 9/10 IF nintendo did not choose that i need a own switch if i want to play on my own island when 2 players want to play this game. Wtf nintendo. Right, no animal crossing had this before but no DS had more than 2 accounts aviable either!!","Game was great, until I realized you could only have 1 save. With progress locked to one character, so if you share your Switch with other users, you're unable to make any kind of progress unless the original character has done so. Nintendo expecting people to go out and buy another $300 console just for another Switch is completely unacceptable.","This game is as wonderfully entertaining as it is broken in forcing people to buy multiple switches and copies of the game to play it to it's fullest. Nintendo are being completely trash with the way save games are being handled with this game and forcing only one Island per console.","I have nothing to say...\rI expected better...\rThe game itself - GREAT.\rBUT... the GIANT DOWNFALL is....\r 1 ISLAND PER CONSOLE???? :(\r I thought the nintendo switch was a shared console....plz fix this with an update...only if this was fixed I would need nothing else and would give the score straight up a 10...","The game has potential but thanks to one island per consol. This game is absolutely terrible. My boyfriend happened to start the game first, and he never has time to play. Therefore I am extremely limited on progressing through the game. This limitation was given to fuel more switch sales. Unfortunately, even with that in mind, if we did decide to break down and buy more, WE CAN'T; THEY ARE SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE!!!! I officially lost all respect for nintendo, I have been a fan for many years and still play my super nintendo from time to time. I will never again spend money to profit this company.","I\u2019ve been looking forward to this game for quite sometime. I bought my Switch at launch for BOTW and hopes of a new Animal Crossing game in the future. I preordered 2 copies, one for each of my kids to play on their Switch Lites, and the wife and I were going to just share on our main console. The fact that player 2 is no more than a background character to, what I have no doubt, will be a super fun experience, is complete garbage. There\u2019s no progression through the game unless player 1 (the first resident on the island) gets multiple tasks done first, in order to progress the story.  I get they\u2019re just trying to sell more consoles, but this is a crap way to do it. I\u2019m not buying a 4th console just so everyone in my household can have a complete gaming experience. If you have children/roommates/spouses, and plan to share the game, rethink your purchase.","I never leave a review but I had to say something. I was third person to start a character on our family switch so didnt understand why I could create a museum. After three days our island should have had a museum so I wanted to get started on that but soon realized that wasn't an option being the 3rd player to start the game. The 1st player is the only person able to progress the game and my daughter would rather draw pictures on the bulletin. There needs to be an update to allow the whole family to play this game and enjoy the experience.","If you share a switch player 2 is completely removed from the whole game experience. Obviously a ploy to make you buy another switch. They have no say on where buildings go, miss out on all the cool diy recipes that you get when setting up new houses, and cannot progress them game on their own. This game shows that Nintendo is just as greedy as EA","Having the first player that creates the island completely drive the story and gate all other players is just ridiculous. Fix this!","I hope improving your bottom line was worth it because it was done at the expense, of the relationships, of families who can only afford one switch.","I've been excited for this game since the first Nintendo Direct that announced it, but I started up Doom Eternal first and handed the Switch off to my wife so she could play AC. She has maybe a dozen or more hours on it now, and I'm done with Doom Eternal, only to find out I can't have my own island and my progress is limited by her. I'm disappointed enough that I might use the term heartbroken to describe how I feel. The decision Nintendo made to do this is almost infuriating and there's no way I'm buying a separate console to play one game. I'm giving this 1 star because my wife seems to be enjoying it. I guess I'll have to wait another few years till she's bored of it and doesn't mind me wiping her savesave to finally get to play it. What a tremendous waste of money.","Will not be playing, or coerced into bending over and taking $360 in the gyroid. Fix the \"one island\" bs. Selfish nintendo. We buy you for our kids. You're like the nanny that beats your children and steals from you while you're at work. UPDATES REQUIRED!","Really disappointed that I can\u2019t have my own island. What\u2019s worse is that the role of player 2 is so constrained that I essentially am not able to experience the game at all. This design choice will certainly make me more skeptical of future Nintendo products.","Good game being held back by how greedy or incompetent Nintendo is being. The game is supposed to be shared with all of your family, yet, only one person is able to see most of the content, that person being the one who set up the island in the console. Nintendo wants you to buy another console if you want an additional save file. We are in 2020, back in the Gamecube days we had 3 save files for almost every game, there is no excuse to only have one. I am seriously disappointed in Nintendo doing this, it is disgusting.","Do not buy this if you're planning on playing couch co op. I ended up returning it due to the lack of involvement my partner was allowed.","Echoing what others are saying. It's a good game but families will be in for a disappointed. I thought Nintendo is a pro-family company. Artificially restricting others users on the same Switch from creating their own world and enjoy the game to the fullest is a deal breaker. I hope they fix this soon. What a shame!","Wtf one island? My fiance can't even play the game as it is supposed to be and I have to deal with her stealing all my furniture!","Disgusting practice by Nintendo. I've lost all Respect for this Company. What a disgrace.","11 days after release.  Still cannot play the game because all Switches are sold out everywhere.  This one island per console joke has cost me $60 and my switch.  Good luck.","I cannot grasp why the second player literally cannot have any fun on this game rather than be an at best \"shadow\" to the resident leader or a resource collector. It completely takes away from the experience. I bought this game for my girlfriend who is not an avid gamer, but loves the animal crossing titles. I can understand the appeal of the game and I would love to play it, but i am basically being forced to wait for her to play, which is not nearly as often as I would like to play. PLEASE fix this issue of being player 2 it takes away from the game entirely. Literally, not enjoyably if you are player 2.","The limitation of 1 island per console makes this a cash grab that EA would be proud of and ruins a perfectly great experience.  Nintendo needs to fix this!","The 1 island per console concept ruined the game for me. I can't fully enjoy the game now or progress at my own pace since it will all be controlled by the first player and on the reverse side, if I was the first player, I would be forced to progress for the next player.\rI know Nintendo doesn't care but I had hope they wouldn't do this again like with every other Animal Crossing game. Welp, there's always the next one.","Would easily be a 9 or 10... if I wasnt completely unable to progress for letting my little sister play first, meaning she is resident rep. She swears she is never asked to complete the tasks needed, or else it's unclear.  All I can do is spend nook miles to farm resources before handing the console back to her. Worse still, only the resident rep is given crafting recipes, so no ladder for me..... would like to know went diving is gone to, as we were looking forward to it.","Experience from the whole game was ruined by the fact that second player is just a barely more than a visitor. They can't do anything that is going to make an impact on the game moving forward. If this whole cash grab strategy with one island is fixed, then the game is 10/10","A fun game that I really wanted to play but what a **** multiplayer mode. Having only one island wouldn't be that much of a problem if all players could contribute to quests. But here, the game is just for one person. There is absolutely no interest for the other players.","FIX THE ONLY ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE. I honestly wouldn\u2019t even care if I had to buy another game, but really you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Ridiculous. There is no player 2 in this game, you don\u2019t get to play. You\u2019re living off someone else\u2019s game, totally missing your mark. Losing fans, losing customers, losing the people that made this 3x larger in sales than your other games. Honestly, where do you get off I doubt people will come back next time for Animal Crossing if this isn\u2019t fixed.","Pretty good game, having a lot of fun personally, but I can't in good faith give a good review considering the hard limitations in this game, and some of the tediousness.\r It's extremely annoying that there's only One island per switch. And to top it all off, only the first player can actually even do anything on said island. I love this game, so much I wish I could make a second island to make it completely different from my own! And besides my issues, there's a Ton of people out there who's switches are in households. Households with more than one person. Imagine a family with twins, or siblings, who get this game. Only one of them can play. And yeah, sorry but not everyone can **** afford two or more consoles.\r And to my second point: the tediousness. I don't generally mind games being grind-y. I playing monster hunter for god's sake. But having to craft each fish bait individually **** SUCKS ASS. I appreciate them at least giving a fast forward on the crafting cut-scene, but having to go through it + all 5 menus just to craft one item at a time is FLAT GARBAGE. Not to mention it's just  time consuming in all the wrong ways. Want to make a good fishing rod? Well guess what bud, you don't have a recipe for 5 sticks and 1 iron, YOU HAVE to go through the cut-scene twice because for some dumb **** reason nothing is streamlined.\r It'd be such a better experience if you could A: Bulk Craft items like fish bait, and B: Have not just 'upgrade' recipes but also streamlined recipes where I could just make a fishing rod straight up with 5 sticks and 1 iron, the same amount it costs already, without the hassle.\r Anyways yeah don't buy this game if you have more than one AC fan in your house, or get prepared to buy new islands for $200 minimum LOL","Nintendo has ruined this game with their greed. If you share a console with anyone do not buy this game as only one player is allowed to enjoy the game PER CONSOLE. Even if you buy a second copy it will still only let you play one save per switch. Not only that but the second player only counts as a visitor and can\u2019t contribute anything to the island besides gathering supplies. Ridiculous decision by Nintendo.","My Daughters and I enjoyed playing the game until we discovered that there can be only one island saved per console and one person controlling it.  That's deal buster as 3 of us share one console and it's a ridiculous limitation.  If Nintendo patches this I'll change the scoring to 8.","The game isn't playable if you have more than one family member who wants to play, so I guess choose your favorite family member? Only 1 island allowed, unless developers update that restriction.","The second player options are needlessly limited, avoid this game if you want to do family co op.","Animal Crossing is a nice game if you're the only one using the switch...Like many others here I can't enjoy the game to the fullest since I'm sharing the Island and I wasn't the first to start the story. I already have problems and I just started: can't give donations, can't get an axe, can't help with the progress of the Island, etc. It just feels like I have no purpose at all other then helping the first user :( Really hope Nintendo will be able to change this issue","If you have your own personal switch that you play without the need to share, this game could easily be a 10 for you. However, as someone who shares a switch with their family, this game is extremely disappointing and limiting considering the fact that only one person can play the game to its full potential. I am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one island where only one player has full control over progression while others fight over the limited daily resources. How unbelievably stupid was that decision? I know many will argue that this is how Animal Crossing games have always been. So? That doesn't make the decision good. For instance, Breath of the Wild was an instant hit in my household. This could not be the case if everyone was locked into the same save. Instead, everyone had their own save and could make their own decisions. Scratch that with Animal Crossing. My younger sister was eager the play after me, but couldn't find anything to do after 5 minutes. For a second player, this game deserves a 0/10. This stands true until every individual profile has the option to tend to their own individual island. It just ruins the experience. I hope these negative user reviews open Nintendo's eyes to this frustrating issue. Especially since the Nintendo Switch is advertised as a console to be shared...","This game is ALMOST perfect. If you love games that relax you then this is the game for you. If you have multiple people using your switch however, look at other games. The inability to create multiple islands on one switch makes it so that there has to be a  \"primary user\" is the first person who plays. Which doesn't sound like an issue but the game does not accommodate for the person who plays as player 2+. If player one gathers all the resources of the day there is nothing left for player two to collect and hence nothing for them to do. Player one can upgrade their house, upgrade and create all the shops, and customize the landscape and transform the deserted island into a city, what can player 2 do? Nothing except upgrade your house. An obvious attempt from nintendo to get people to buy more switches. In the past you could switch out you save card, you cannot mess with your saves in this game. You cant even send your data to the cloud to switch off saves because nintendo doesn't allow cloud saves. Which also means if u lose/break your switch the hundreds of hours you put into the game will be lost and you have to start all over. If nintendo wants to make everyone live on the same island then there HAS to be equal accommodation for EVERYONE on the island, but there isn't.","Only _one_ save file (island) per switch.\rOnly the *first* player gets any real control over the island. Selecting where buildings go, terraforming, etc.\rAny other players basically get to watch player one play the game.\rFeels like it was pushed out early and more will be added in \"updates.\"\rNintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game alone, I suggest avoiding it.\rThe saddest part is, a ton of negativity would go away if they removed the one island restriction.","This is a Masterpiece of A life simulation getaway, my only gripe with this game is how it very restrictive with the Multiplayer with Friends and Family, but for me  this is a game that I mostly play by myself, and it's honestly the definitive Animal Crossing fixing alot of the issues from Other titles and expanded upon the mechanics that they established. I Love This Game.","Nintendo has a knack for releasing one-of-a-kind, otherwise fantastic games that are dragged into the mud by one or two miserable 'features.' New Horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature- multiplayer. While the limitation of \"one island per Switch\" was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the \"island representative.\" All progress on the island, such as crafting recipes, buildings, and public works are locked behind the first person to play the game on a system. Secondary players likewise do not receive anything from progressing the game's 'story' such as awarded crafting recipes, items, money, or any unique character dialogue or cutscenes tied to them, such as when completing the museum or town hall. Local multiplayer is likewise gutted, with the camera, inventory, and NPC interaction being tied exclusively to the session's \"leader.\" Online multiplayer is not much better, being essentially the same as New Leaf's without its mini-game island or any equivalent, which was a good portion of the online content for that game. These make for an extremely underwhelming and downright frustrating multiplayer experience that is difficult for even the most easily entertained to enjoy, which is particularly upsetting as the game, at its core, is extremely fun and almost everything you could hope for from an Animal Crossing game.\r I have my doubts Nintendo will address this issue. They have ignored other key product issues, such as Joy-Cons drifting and poor online services, to burying their head in the sand and hoping it'll blow over. I sincerely hope that they are not successful in skirting responsibility on this one- this is a decision made out of pure greed to sell more Switch systems, that thankfully, could not have been made at a worse time. I do hope Nintendo patches the game to allow multiple islands per system, or at the very least, improve the gameplay of secondary residents.","The fact that the second player is so limited is complete bs. Come on who approved this dumb system.","It is ridiculous that Nintendo does not allow each user to have a separate island. Not even buying a second cartridge works, you have to buy a second switch system for another island and that is just bs. This is even worse than EA!","One island per Switch is such a greedy money grab. 0/10 you can do better than this.","Nintendo did a really cool thing where the first player to make their character on your Switch is the ONLY player who actually has access to the entire game. I cannot give resources to Tom Nook for building upgrades or progress my town in any meaningful way. I cannot for the life of me understand why Nintendo thought that only 1/8 people should be the one to have access to all of the game leaving 7 other players with a demo version.I was about to buy a freaking Switch Lite and ANOTHER copy of AC:NH  until I realized I can't transfer saves!!! Good moves Nintendo. Game is essentially unplayable unless the primary player is giving you a play by play update of EVERYTHING that's happening on their end and even then secondary players can't even give those resources to the NPC's that need them. This is basically like how in Sonic and Knuckles the person who plays Tails is just aimlessly flying around the level where as Sonic is the actual one who's really in control.","This is not a multiplayer game. It will likely become one when Nintendo figures out how to charge people another $60 for the functionality.","One island per Switch? Horrible horrible decision. By the time my kids are finished playing and its my turn, all the fruit is picked, trees chopped down and rocks cracked. I could go on and on. Zero points.","One island per switch makes it unplayable for me. Wish I could return the game since we know Nintendo won't change it","I want to give this game a good review. I really do. However, the one island per console thing just kills the game for me. I was totally ok with sharing an island with my spouse, but we don't share the island. Everyone who starts the game after the first person is a glorified visitor.  I realize this was a thing in older animal crossing games, but as far as I know, you could at least buy a second copy of new leaf if you wanted to have your own experience. Tying the island to the console instead of the cartridge is just ridiculous. If Nintendo decides to fix this then I will be happy to write a new glowing review. As far as I can tell if you are the only person in your household interested in playing then it's a great game. As for my score: I know a lot of people are arguing that it's unfair to review bomb because \"we're not complaining about the actual gameplay\" but i watched every official trailer and Nintendo Direct about the game. Nowhere does it say your experience may be limited if you share a console. I understand that it was like this in older games. But not all of us played the older games. To for some people, this is their first animal crossing and something this knuckleheaded can actually ruin the franchise for them. My 0 score is my plea for Nintendo to at least patch it so each unique cartridge can generate an island.","You can only create one island per Switch!Do not buy this if you have multiple players in your house planning to play the game. Was excited to share this game with spouse, so disappointed to learn that we need to buy another Switch and another copy of the game to play together. Greedy-ass decision, Nintendo.","Only allowed 1 file per switch. An absolute slap in the face for a family system. Want to clear the trees of fruit in the morning? Anyone who plays in the evening can't pick fruit. Want to plant flowers around your house? Your little brother can remove em any time. Gonna play for several months but your sibling only wants to try it out? Their tent is there perm. Absolutely garbage.","News flash! You'll have no fun if anyone else in your household wants to play this besides you. They seriously pulled the dumbest, greediest looking move ever. They made it so you can only have 1 island per SWITCH CONSOLE! doesn't matter if you have different profiles or not, doesn't matter that you bought a game you own. No one island per smitch. THATS Such BS. Theyve lost many sales from myself and family because this a poor decision, worse than loot boxes in star wars.Nothing else matters, Becca's this restriction exist.","Hi, I'm a lifelong Animal Crossing fan who made a metacritic account just to leave this review. I've faithfully bought every nintendo console, and every Animal Crossing game, and New Horizons was no exception. Leading up to the launch I was hesitant and skeptical, but still full of hype and excitement. As the game started nearing towards launch I started getting worried about the lack of content shown, and the rumors of removing gender-related content.\r Indeed it seems both worries ended up being genuine and it turns out that New Horizons has received *massive* cuts compared to older games. I'll start with my chief complaint which is that the ability to play as a girl has been removed entirely, at least to my knowledge. There is a \"gender\" option at the beginning of the game which does nothing, and characters misgender you regardless of what you pick. Feminine walk/run animations were removed entirely. Likewise all gendered comments (including compliments) were removed. The game makes no reference to gender at all to the point of misgendering people. The option is basically there to lull you into a false sense of security.\r Most of the game's content is locked behind weeks worth of waiting, which is particularly bad for an AC game but not unprecedented. The game shipped without *any* holidays, and requires online connectivity to access such content. More or less every major Animal Crossing character has been cut from the game (including Redd, Katrina, Brewster, Harriet, Rover, Kapp'n, etc.). Despite AC usually being about freedom of choice, the game pretty much railroads you for the first several days (as opposed to the usual quick tutorial sequence). It's already been almost a week and despite going at full pace, able sisters are nowhere to be seen (they come after about 2 weeks, instead of the usual which is being there immediately)..\r Patterns are \"back\", but not the way you'd like. To get full use out of it you also need a 3DS and copy of New Leaf, so that you can make certain patterns inside of that game, make a QR, then get your phone, scan the QR, making sure you pay the monthly fee for Nintendo's online service. Only *then* can you get every type of clothing in the pattern maker. NH lacks certain pattern options so you have to scan them in. There *is* a few more options which is nice, but it's not as much as I'd hoped.\r Art is removed entirely as redd is gone. Gyroids are gone entirely.\r The positives of the game are the nook miles system, which I wasn't very excited for despite it being a solid addition, and the crafting. Crafting is fun, but is just the usual furniture system albeit with an extra step (collecting resources) which means the process to collect furniture is now even *slower* than before. The game is lacking in content and to make up for it they drip-feed the existing content at a snails pace (much slower than previous entries).\r I really like that you can send letters to IRL friends without having to visit their town, which makes the letter sending feature actually useful. Terraforming seems cool but is end game so I don't have that yet. My complaint about AC: New Horizons is the exact same complaint I had about Zelda: Breath of the Wild: it's a great engine, but there's no game there.\r All in all what i usually come to Animal Crossing for is an affirming creative space where I can be myself and talk with the virtual npcs who can act as affirming and supportive friends. You won't find that here. The villagers in game have repetitive stale dialogue, misgender you and your IRL friends, and are very lacking for the first week (you only start with 2 and get a third after almost a week in). On the plus side the animations and actions they can perform are much more detailed and involved which is great.\r All in all this feels more like an animal crossing engine with injected transphobia, sexism, and hate. If you're looking at animal crossing because it seems like a cute welcoming game where you can get creative and relax.... you're better off with New Leaf, as New Horizons is just kinda a let down. I know looking back I'll probably revisit NL rather than NH. Perhaps I missed something? This may be the last AC game I buy if things continue like this.","this game is totally good, except for that one island feature. i can't play AC: New Horizons without waiting for my girlfriend comming from work and continue playing, cause she is the major. **** system","Honestly the one island per switch feature doesn't affect me since I'm the only user of my switch. However as a matter of principle I'm giving this a bad review. This is such a baffling decision by Nintendo. I mean seriously, what were they thinking?? This just shows how absolutely greedy they are and how little they care about their fans. With this move they basically gave a middle finger to all of us and told us that they only care about making money. I always thought they were one of the good ones, but after this I'm reconsidering that position. Shame on you Nintendo!","\"You can only create one island per Nintendo Switch system, even if you use multiple games.

You are not only locked to one island per game console, but player 2 is progression locked behind player 1 and cannot do any story activities at all, and they also can't get any tools unless player one has them already. They also can't get any tools the first player didn't already get.\r Essentially, if you are player two you can't even really play the game. There is absolutely no reason for it to work this way, as evidenced by the ability to have multiple profiles in the latest pokemon games.","Me and my GF Sharing one Island..the fact that only one player is a full Citizen ruin the whole experience!","This game is meant to be a household game where multiple people can play on the same island/town without hindered progress and etc. The current state of the game makes the second person on the island unable to progress through the game as well as limitations on what you can place/do. This is the last thing any of us wanted and has ruined the experience for me. This is a HUGE issue that I have no idea why it even got through the testing phase. Change this Nintendo or else I won\u2019t be purchasing DLC nor continue playing this game.","Im sorry but its total bs to just have one island, otherwise the game is perfect","The fact only one person gets to play per switch is insulting. What about if I have two kids? Returning this money grab of a game. Shame on you!","I bought this game expecting that my girlfriend and I could play together and enjoy our island together. Since we spend a lot of time apart at work or taking care of different chores, this felt like it could be a nice way to have a shared activity, if asynchronous, and chat about it later on. I was wrong.Not only do you get limited to a single island per switch (which is a bummer, absolutely unacceptable in 2020, but I knew that going in), but the game is only for the first person to create the island. That's right: if you're the second person to jump in, you can't do anything. You essentially walk around aimlessly. What an absolutely garbage system.So I bought a game that only one of us can enjoy. If you thought this could be a fun time for more than one person, this game is not for you. It certainly was not for me.","My family can\u2019t even play the game to it\u2019s fullest because they only give you one island for the entire switch and only one person can play the game to it\u2019s fullest DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","This game feels so incomplete, it doesn\u2019t even match the content new leaf had several years ago??

I miss the mini games we could do in new leaf being on that island and collecting medals. I also miss doing favours for villagers. I\u2019m quite disappointed as I\u2019ve waited years for this game, it\u2019s too slow.The crafting system is just dull, smashing rocks and cutting trees over and over spoils the fun and becomes more like unwanted chores. You have to carry the gatherings in your pocket to craft them which takes up too much room and it doesn\u2019t link with your storage which is silly.There\u2019s not enough content for adventure. Moving buildings is also expensive and a long process, also upgrading them takes a day. Where is the fun?","This is a personal experience. Relaxing game, although the pace is a little too slow sometimes.","EDIT 7/6/21: Yeah... that didn't age quite well.\rThe only issue with this game in my opinion, is the fact that the updates are...\rYou know, I would have been happy if they delayed the game in order to get the entire game packed into the base game. All we got is a game that is fun at the start, but gets boring because it's early-access.\rThat's about it. Pick it up if you love Animal Crossing, but New Leaf is superior in every way (excluding graphics).\rOld review: This game is a masterpiece. It's a game you should ALWAYS buy for your switch no matter what. You can never get bored of it, and you can get so much hours off of it easily. There is so much to do in the game, and there is always something to do in it. You can customize the look of your character, your island, your house, and you can get villagers! This is, without a doubt, one of the best Nintendo Switch games.\rSo, you may be asking, why does this game have a 7.0 user review, and why so much hate? Simple, immature review bombers putting 0 on the damn game because of one **** con about it. Don't be surprised, they're just mad because they didn't do research, wait, didn't Nintendo tell us about it, and wasn't it like this for the past AC games? I respect disliking that dumb feature, but don't give this game a 0 just because of that, actually try playing it for a while first.","Early play review: the first 8 hours are great.  We have 2 players on our system and in my opinion as long as you have the primary player set up the island it works great.  My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.\r Sharing an Island thoughts:\rSo far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island.  I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game.  Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.\rI always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing.  How one player would teach the computer characters specific words.  You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers.  Competing to get rare fossils first.  To me that was the fun of the game.  Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.\r Actual Game Review:\rI love it.  To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression.  If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want.  If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is.  Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game.  This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years.  Animal Crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with NPC's who you chat with and just hang out.  They are like virtual friends.  They learn your speech and are happy to see you.  You gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around.  These are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home.  You can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be.  It is all fun in a passive sort of way.  The game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years.  You do a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays.  Slowly collecting things and changing the world.  I imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak.  You can play for hours a day but that probably isn't the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress.  If these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it.  Animal Crossing really is an acquired taste but I am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years.","It\u2019s a great game, short of giving it a 10 because the save file stuff is crap.","The arbitrary limitation to allow only one island, and essentially, only one save file, is an incredibly anti-consumer move that limits the potential of this game. It incentivises and requires those who want to have a complete experience of the game to buy a new Switch system, or become side-lined while the first account (player) to start the game gains the special privilege as the island leader, and all the benefits that come with that. Of course, this only poses a problem if you are sharing the Switch system, or want to play with your loved ones while having an equal experience. An ironic punishment considering the nature of family-orientated Nintendo gaming systems. This does not even include cloud saving restrictions, of which New Horizons is not supported.","One island per switch is dumb. WTF Nintendo? I will no longer purchase games with pointless restrictions like this.","the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands sucks. i can't even review the game properly because i can't progress properly","Game is relaxing and quite fun sometimes, but that \"one island restriction\" is just killing the fun of the game for me. I share my Switch with my 9-year-old sister and we both want to have different islands, different progression, different furniture but we simply can't because of Nintendo. We even had to restart the game completely because I let her start the game first (I am 24 years old, I could play some other thing in the meanwhile) but then we realized that only she could really make the game advance and complete missions while I just could watch, so she agreed to restart the game so I could be the major with her help, but this shouldn't be the way.\r She wanted to have her island so she could play whenever she wanted and I wanted to have mine too for the same reason. Now both have to share resources and we have to agree where and when to build important buildings such as the museum when what we wanted really was to have one island each other then visit the other one's island when we wanted to see what we were doing. I think that allowing to have different saves on a single console is not that difficult in 2020 so... c'mon Nintendo, don't be as always and let the players choose how they want to play instead of you enforcing things like this because I paid 60 freaking euros for the game and I want to play the way I want.","This game has been marketed as a game for family amd friends where the multiplayer was encouraged, yet if you don\u2019t get to start the islamd, you\u2019re basically a roamer that aimlessly collects fruit. You give no contribution to the development of the island and are bound to the progress the first player decides to male, it feels like you don\u2019t matter at all, you don\u2019t even receive recipes or anything.   Factor in the decision of one island per console and you can easily jump to the conclusion that nintendo wants every engaged player to own a console, and since the Nintendo switch sits on a price range that\u2019s way higher than that of the Nintendo 3DS this is just absurd.    If you\u2019re alone the game is fine and perfect, if you share the console with other people the game will be cool just for the first player, and utterly boring and discriminating for the remaining players. Also, if the first player stops playing, everyone is stuck and the only option is to restart the game from zero.","Don't buy this game if you have more people playing on one Switch. It is a good Game for the first Player that enters the game, but the next player that wants to start the game is strictly limited in his gameplay.","My bf started playing before me. No option to create my own island and being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks. You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.","So great game if you are the first player. However, if you are playing local multiplayer with your family the game is absolute trash. Everything in the game is progress locked behind the first player. Whoever came up with the Resident Representative idea has no idea what Animal Crossing should be.Hopefully at some point Nintendo removes this so that all players can play the game equally.","The multiplayer sucks on this one. They might as well say it's single player on the store page. And by the way: 1 island per switch. How on earth you people don't have 1 switch per family member at this point? /s","The Game is great for one person per day as once one player has done something on the island the other player has no purpose for that whole day and cannot progress at all the perfect fix for the game would be one 'island' per switch but sub island's which are un editable by accounts who dont own that sub island, or better yet just an option for cloud saves or 2 islands.","It is so ridiculous that only one player has access to all of the features of the game. I allowed my younger sister to play the game before me, and now as player two I won't be able to do everything! Shame on you Nintendo for your greed and laziness!","We have 3 daughters that play this game and I've got to say, TERRIBLE decision to only allow 1 island per Switch!  Really leaves a bad taste in my mouth towards Nintendo.  I can't imagine they didn't see these issues as being a problem before release, which, I think, makes them terrible, greedy people.  Here I thought they were a family-priority company.  Disgraceful!","Payed for a switch, Payed for an online subscription, payed for the game, can't even enjoy it fully because I'm player 2.\r Never again","The local multiplayer is terrible. For an idea of the target audience, the settings only have 2 options, and has a raccoon tell you to get your parents before using them. I tried to get my money back, but Nintendo's return policy isn't as good as Steams.","I got this for my Brother and i. He played just long enough to save before handing it to me. I was unable to progress past where he had got in the story. SPOILER: i couldn't get a flimsy shovel because player 2 can't donate to tom nook. i now have to either play his account or progress both in order to play...I was even able to look past having to share an island before realizing we weren't sharing. player two is just a guest in player ones world. Once the hype train slows this game with show it's true colors. Don't hate it just very disappointed.","I mean, I kind of understand why most of the negative reviews are just against the one island per console thing that also happened with the rest of the entire franchise and that was clearly said in the AC Direct and in the back of the game box, cause it's still a bad thing. I get why people are punishing the limitations of multiplayer cause it was one of the main things in every trailer/announcement and in some aspects it can be really poor. But I just can't understand all the 0/10, especially the ones saying it's like a HD New Leaf.\r Are we playing the same game? I've spend my last three days around my island in a 4K monitor and I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played. Every franchise has its style, you can't make this game with the details of Red Dead Redemption 2 because you could destroy what AC means: simple but cool relaxing folky ambients to spend your life on. New Horizons maintains the style of the saga with new and more detailed than ever graphics, amazing lightning and weather effects and the perfect acoustic soundtrack for a walk in the woods (plus a lot of new and reinvented features that combine very well with that \"deserted island in modern days\" feel of everything).\r It came out a few days ago and I don't get why some people are asking for big things at the very beginning of a game that's supposed to be played day by day for a very long time. In the third day around the island I had sooooo many things to do I really didn't know where to start. The way you can decorate everything step by step, and the way you feel when you finally unlock every little feature... I think it's the best AC ever made, or at least one of the great ones. And for all the missing characters and features for the fans like Brewster or the gyroids it's all coming soon with free updates.\r Maybe you're new and you were looking for a different experience, maybe you really didn't know it was limited to one island (which is a very bad point but it's not something Nintendo has tried to hide with this and any other past Animal Crossing game), or idk, maybe you want a Grand Theft Animal... What I'm just trying to say is that I believe this is a pretty good game that doesn't deserve all the hate it's receiving here. Just calm down. Times are getting very weird and this is the perfect game to stress out :)","It's great fun (for one person per console), but some serious oversight regarding local multiplayer progression hampers the main point of such a communal video game experience. Simply allowing others to contribute to town building projects instead of locking them behind the main account holder would vastly improve the game. The fact that only one person can access the construction boxes for new resident plots is case-and-point of this poor design.","I want to preface this by saying I do enjoy this game when playing single player. The only problem is I play with my wife and anyone who wants to play this game with one or more people will have a horrible time. Couch co op in New Horizons might be the worst co op I have every played in any video game. Anyone who is not player 1 is unable to access their inventory, interact with villagers or even go into buildings. How can a game have local multiplayer without split screen in 2020? It\u2019s pathetic and it shows how low Nintendo will go to sell more consoles. If it wasn\u2019t for this the game would be rated much higher but this is a definite deal breaker. You dun goofed, Nintendo.","1 save! rly? I hate this nintendou game. animal crossing is forcing me to buy additional switch to play with my FAMILY!!!!!!!!","Honestly, the game itself is hidden behind problems like micromanaging and nerfs, the idea that a game like this needs to be controlled to such an extent is really silly imo. nerfing various spawns in the game by 90% forcing absolutely terrible events that actually impede a person's ability to play. (Substituting pretty much every findable item for eggs that spawn at a ridiculous rate (Think higher than 50% frequently)Honestly I could go on, the base game is alright, everything that they've attached to it is a cancerous growth that has ruined the host game.plusThe fact that I would have to buy a completely new switch and game to be able to share the game the people I live with is completely unacceptable.","Extremely limited game if you are sharing the island. As the seccond account, there is not much tou can do to interact with the game world.","I don\u2019t like to give unreasonable ratings to games but I hope Nintendo realizes that they made a mistake forcing people to buy multiple switches in order to play this game with their friends.  I spent $60 on this game to escape the resource-sharing nightmare of being quarantined with 4 people in my household indefinitely.  I expected the peace and tranquility of my own island, and the fun of sharing that island with *visitors*, hoping my housemates would start their own islands on our shared switch. The second day with this game I learned that is not an option. Not only are my housemates forced to share the same island with me, the resources on my island are shared between all of us.  Anybody can move anything outside of their houses anywhere on the island. Playing local coop is completely brain dead for the second player, like bad enough that an intelligent child would get bored of it instantly. My experience with this game went from a peaceful private getaway to a mirror of the frustrating situation of being trapped in a too-small space with too many people indefinitely.  If there was ever a game that can reproduce the annoyance and fatigue of sharing an apartment with 4 other people in viral quarantine, it\u2019s this game.  If you have one switch and multiple people who want to play this game, don\u2019t bother.  I really want to play it, I really want to like it, there are so many things about it that seem great for a single person to enjoy, but the multiplayer mechanics have made it impossible for me to appreciate these things. I would have paid $60 to avoid the disappointment and frustration this game has made me feel.  Anyways... bad move Nintendo, I really don\u2019t understand the thought here unless it was a financial one. Please learn from this mistake.","Unreal that I\u2019m stuck without a shovel because my wife was the first user on our switch.  Had no idea the first player on the island needed to progress first, should give some warning.  Love the game but this is a big eff up.","Boring, repetitive. In the live-services era, Nintendo decided to launch a game UNFINISHED, just to ignore it two months after the release. No regular updates, the same boring activities over and over again. At this point, i feel more entretained playing the mobile free to play Pocket Camp than playing this 60 dollar game. I'm almost sure i will sell it by the end of the month.","Would be a perfect 10 if it weren't for the unnecessarily clunky couch co-op (especially considering how well the first animal crossing implemented it) you have a primary player who can play the game as normal and a secondary player who can... Sit there and look pretty? They can pick up items, albeit slowly with an annoying animation playing each time and items are sent to the recycle bin instead of your inventory. You can fish and catch bugs, but only as long as they're on the same screen as the primary player (they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen)The only saving grace is the fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers. Otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games, with better visuals, customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count. In older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day, in New horizons there seems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play. The new ability to Terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like I'm really starting a little town of my very own! If you are playing on your own, you won't be able to find a better animal crossing experience! If you are buying this to play with a friend, however, just keep the limitations of couch co-op in mind before you buy. Nintendo should have been more transparent about this clunky co-op pre-launch but i know exactly why they weren't (and Tom Nook would have done the same thing)","I will surely sink lots of time in this game. Do not see any problem with the restriction (one console - one island), just buy your wife/kid a Switch.","Very upset about this game. Loading times too long, I don't like waiting 10 seconds everytime I leave a tent. I hate the noises the characters make when they speak. But the worst part of all. MY SHARED CONSOLE MEANS ONLY 1 PERSON CAN PLAY THIS GAME. I share a switch with my boyfriend and because of the \"one island per console\" bull crap we basically can't both play it without one person having severely lacking boring and depressing game play. So I've let him have it. I'm very upset that a 60 dollar game only allows one save and not allowing separate games for separate profiles. Will NEVER buy another animal crossing. This was my first animal crossing ever and I'm glad I never bought any of the previous. They don't deserve my money.","It's a very slow start (a few real-time days), but once you get past that barrier.....the world opens up massively. It's a peaceful game to hop into whenever you feel like it, and rewards those that play long hours, or even 1 or 2 at a time. Highly recommended to those looking for an escape (and if you truly want to customize your character, get the pro editor in the nook miles store ","EDITED: After 3 days it's gotten a lot better. Everyday there is more stuff to do. Boosting my rating from 7 to a 9. Love this game and am going to play it every day.","Game getting review bombed over nitpicks and small inconveniences, sounds about metacritic.","This game has some great elements and it is a lot of fun for the FIRST player to boot it up. For every other user who shares the switch console you are given a sub par experience. Only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game, complete with building shops, completing tasks for Nook, moving buildings, unlocking recipes, and generally continuing the storyline. Everyone else does not even get to help donate resources to building projects so their ability to progress in the game is limited by how much the primary player has unlocked. Nintendo is basically trying to force households to buy multiple consoles and multiple copies of the game as that is the only way for everyone to get the full experience!The island also does not have enough resources to go around when you have to share those resources with everyone else in your household who plays the game. It can easily create tension and arguments as players fight over the valuable resources like iron that are in limited supply but are needed for crafting. I love the animal crossing series and was really looking forward to this game, but since my husband happened to log on first, I do not get to experience the game as it is meant to be. I am so frustrated that Nintendo would limit us with this one island per console garbage!","The game is amazing, beutifull and totally remmebers me my childhood. But this limitation that only main account can trigger main events. Im fine with having only one island, specially i bought the game to play with my girlfrind and i think its pretty good being able to be in the same island.\r But in the other hand, not being able to experience full game with a secondary account... thats so bad, finally feel like farming materials for the main account, like, if the owner of this main account is not playing, you have to connec to his account to trigger new events and follow with the story. So bad and i complay because i cannot understand the reason behind","Really need to fix multiple people on one console, i have 3 grils and each one wants to play this game, i cannot afford to buy them each their own switch, there is no option to create a new island and being the 2nd player or 3rd player to start on a console SUCKS!!!! You miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities, resources, etc. It's absolutely terrible. You have to buy a 2nd console (or 3rd in my case) if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable.","Really fun and chill game. Encourages playing daily but not ALL day that is a nice change of pace. Easy to lose yourself in. Better multiplayer would be nice.","Having a total blast so far! All the animals are adorable and the music is soft and calming. My friend visited my town and we played instruments together for like 10 minutes. This was definately the kind of \"sit back and relax\" kind of game it was hyped up to be.","It's beautiful, is definitely more than I was expecting.I can't wait for the upcoming events!","Animal Crossing is an absolutely perfect game in all areas. I beg you, dear reader, ignore the entitled nature of the negative reviews. The decision to limit players to a single island has been made for artistic purposes and was very well communicated to the playerbase before they could have made their purchase. At the end of the day the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite consoles are portable devices that most of the time support only one player. Expecting anything else is straight entitlement.\r In the graphical department Animal Crossing: New Horizons is astonishingly amazing. It's gorgeous to look at. The gameplay is fantastic and a lot of fun. This is exactly the game needed to let go and relax during these hard times.","I love the animal crossing series, and ACNH is a perfect addition! Countless islands to explore and everything looks great, lots to do and it is so relaxing just chilling on your personal island. Definitely pick this one up if you enjoy relaxation and fun.","I bought this game as soon as it came out since I have always been a fan. I started my own island an character and fully expected my sister, who shares a switch with me, to be able to play her own game too. We find out later that she can not have her own island and that she is extremely limited to what she can do in the game. The whole point to animal crossing is doing stuff in the community. What is she going to do? Just walk around in a world she cant even dig in? Great job Nintendo. You made what could have been a perfect game into a dud.","Amazing. I don't understand all these criticisms that you can only create one island per switch, if I were you I would confirm by researching the features that provide the game. This game has infinite possibilities, it's perfect. I love everything in this game","Normally, I would give this game an 8 out of 10, but I can not believe Nintendo would allow a first person release that is so incredibly crippled. Against better judgement I decided to try the game knowing that there is only one island per switch (I have never played animal crossings games before so did not realize how annoying that would be). However, they made is worse since the person that creates the island holds everyone else back. I do not have time to play right now, but my son is home and he is essential stuck since I do not have time to play. Maybe I missed something or did not understand when setting everything up, but that for all companies to be that anti consumer I would have never guessed Nintendo. Just seems like a cash grab from a company that has one of the hottest systems ruining a game that would be very good otherwise.","So they disabled cloud saves even though I'm paying $20/year for that. Next, you can't have more than one island per console, so if me and my sister wanted separate islands, we would have to spend $360 dollars to buy an entire new Switch just to have 2 islands. Oh and don't forget that certain features of the game are only available to the player who created the island, so single player is broken for everyone except the island creator. Oh and they made it a lot harder to \"time travel\" in the game. On the 3ds animal crossing, I would set my game time 2 hours different because I like to play every morning at around 6:00 AM and my school starts at 8:00 AM. Everything important in the game happens at 8, so I just set the time so that when it's actually 6, the game thinks it's 8:00. Now it's harder to change the in-game time, so I literally cannot play the game because everything important happens while I am in school. Wow, Nintendo's first party games are getting so bad. The older ones like Smash, Mario Kart, BOTW, etc. were really good but Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion 3, and Mario Maker 2 are all really bad. Their online is absolutely screwed, I can't believe they make me pay $20 for a broken system. Don't buy this game.","Broken multi-player ruined the game. The local co-op is the most poorly designed game mechanic I've ever seen. Why couldn't they just make it split screen like every other game... ever? Beyond that the fact that everyone on a one switch has to share an island is the most desperate attempt to get people to but more switches.","So no cloud saves, only 1 island per console, and everyone except player 1 is screwed over to just collecting flowers? Don't buy this","Be great if I could play the game. One island per console and the nonsense \"resident rep\" makes it impossible for multiple people to play this game. I'm locked out of most of the game because the first player hasn't unlocked everything yet. Hardly a family game for what one would consider the most family friend console. Worst AC to date if things aren't fixed....and I've played almost every game.","Great game, but Nintendo needs to fix the multiplayer couch issue. Every player's account on the switch should be able to access everything and progress. There is no sense of community with just 1 leader and the other players not being able to make major decisions. I don't mind the one island per console .","This game is truly a 1 player game!!! I bought it because it said up to 8 players. Such a lie! False advertising and makes kids very sad. You need a switch per player to really enjoy the game. It has made kids everywhere cry!!!! BIG MISTAKE NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This game would be so close to perfect -- the graphics are gorgeous, the new options for customization and design are excellent, and Nook Miles are a fun addition. HOWEVER, its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung, and it's enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives.\r I was the one to start the game on our Switch because I had a day off work, and therefore relegated my partner's save file to being a sidekick that can't contribute to the main storyline or placement of buildings, and is stuck waiting on whatever progress I make in the game. Even though I have the \"privilege\" of being the first player and RR, my enjoyment in the game is totally shot because I know I took the \"good\" spot from my partner.\r We'd GLADLY buy a second copy of the game so we could each have our own island, but we can't afford to purchase an entire second Switch just because Nintendo can't get their act together.\r It's really a shame that such a great game is totally marred by this (very intentional) design flaw.","The new Animal Crossing is really successful and it is great fun to play this game.There are many innovations and the gameplay has been made very motivating.Now comes the big BUT:You can only build one island per console and per game. That means the second player has the A .... card. We are currently playing the game in party mode on the couch together and we are just EXTREMELY disappointed with Nintendo.How can you develop a game today that has such a bad couch co-op mode and then ask a family that everyone should buy a console and a game if you want to build your own island and not all the time like want to run one annoying tag after the other.A split screen, for example, would have been a great idea for the couch co-op, where the second player can go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants, that should be possible without any problems in 2020.I actually would have liked to give the game 5 stars, but I'm just disappointed with Nintendo, it's not that difficult to provide a separate island for each player on a console.Unfortunately, all other players lose the fun of the game !!!!","I am not a fan that their can only be one island per switch. I hope they fix this soon.","This is 100% the best AC experience so far Ignore the 0s given by stupid people out here, the game is amazing","By far one of the most charming games of 2020. The game offers a variety of tasks and adventure to explore with its new deserted island theme. The DIY crafting mechanic allows you to build new items instead of buying them like in past game and offers new uses for existing material on your island. The characters are charming and have unique personalities that keep the game refreshing.","Absolutely loving the game so far, I love how it's equal amounts of hand-holding and letting you do whatever you want. Can't wait to play this for many years like the previous games. But Nintendo really needs to add more than one island per switch...","Super jeu. Seulement trois jours dessus mais je m'\u00e9clate, il y a toujours des choses a faire et le syst\u00e8me d'objectifs permet de renouveller l'int\u00e9r\u00eat apr\u00e8s la routine quotidienne effectu\u00e9e.\r Ceux qui ont not\u00e9 0 par rapport au multijoueur sont des trolls.\rNous jouons \u00e0 trois sur l'\u00eele et souvent en simultan\u00e9 net nous avons aucun probl\u00e8me avec les ressources.\rAchetez le jeu et jouez y avant de critiquer.","my first ac game; i do not regret.\r video reviews can be a little biased bc of the popularity of ACNL, but it is a genuinely fun game to play. it should be noted more clearly that only one island can be created on a switch &amp; that the community can be a bit toxic, as most communities are, for the way you choose to play the game. As of the time i'm writing this review (a few days after launch), there is a dupe glitch going around that has completely ruined the online trading market. i suspect this'll be patched relatively soon and hopefully the market will level out again soon after. the game itself is very fun to play &amp; very addictive. luckily for me, i didn't run into the island limit problem. if you're the primary owner of your switch, and don't plan on letting others use it, this game is a must have. right up there with Super Mario Odyssey &amp; Breath of the Wild.","While the game is amazingly fun and I can't seem to put it down, whenever I find a bit of free time, there are quite a few things that kind of put a damper on it. - One island per console, as everyone else has complained about. - Not having a quick way to open/close your gates without having to go to your airport.- Having to close your gates to visitors just to spend miles and bells on things at the kiosk.There were a few other things but nothing too big.","This review is written from someone who shares a console with other users, so the review will reflect that experience. Sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing, and leaves much to be desired. Progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who doesn't play as the primary island inhabitant. There is no shared progression toward island milestones, and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner, leaving an imbalanced playing experience. Players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources, with limited contribution to island development. The choice to not have separate islands for separate players, and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island, is highly disappointing, and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game.  It became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island. Secondary players during this timeframe get none of the same recipes, are merely told to \"talk to the primary resident\" for instructions, and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots. Not quite the shared gaming experience people are looking for. Certain choices like these made the experience feel extremely imbalanced and truly disappointing from the standpoint of someone who might not be the primary inhabitant. The only reason I could see Nintendo choosing to design the game in this way is to persuade people to have multiple consoles and copies of the game. One island per console is just not a good approach and could have been much better had single console multi-player been designed more intelligently.","Bought this to play with my girlfriend for local couch co-op, but all the second player can do is fish and pick stuff up. It's not really co-op. You have a glorified helper. Super boring. If you bought this for co-op like I did, reconsider.","This game was ruined for me by the singular island garbage. It needs to be fixed.","Great game if you\u2019re player 1. For everyone else on the same switch, it\u2019s a fraction of the game.","A game that is thought for the family and is about sharing, this is where it fails. A game meant to have family and friends playing together, only in fact, allows one island per Switch console and caps the other users of the  Switch to the development and choices of the first user. Simple example: collect all the fruits for your own user and you'll be selfish enough not to give your younger sister the fruits she so deserved. I'm sorry Nintendo, I don't feel good about being selfish to my younger sister, that's not how my parents raised me. I can't agree with this choice from Nintendo and it actually concerns me why they would make such a choice for a family game.","Still can not understand the main concept of the game.There is really thin gap between the peaceful and the boring. I think this game is the latter. After playing the game for three days, I felt this is kind of \"take-out fast food version of peace .\" If you can be peaceful by playing the game, just eat an ice cream cone or listen to the ambient seashore sound from the YouTube. It's cheaper and effective.","Created an account just to add my voice to the crowd. I bought the game for my fianc\u00e9 and I to play together. Of the two of us, I am the one who is much more likely to play. I let her play the game first so that she could name the island and choose where she wanted her house. Little did I know that she would become the primary player, essentially locking me out of progressing the island on my own at all. What is the point in separating what each player has the capability of doing? She mostly enjoys fishing and catching butterflies, and isn\u2019t interested at all in grinding material. None the less, it\u2019s up to her to progress the game, building items for new homes, opening the museum, etc. On top of that, she\u2019s given recipes that I don\u2019t get to make these things for the home. The secondary account is just at pure disadvantage. I knew coming into the game that we had to share an island, which I had no issue with. What I didn\u2019t realize was that I had to deal with a caste system and have my villager live like a second hand citizen. There was no warning that the secondary account was going to have limited influence on the island. There is no way to switch who is in what position, either. Nintendo really needs to fix this issue. I would be having a thoroughly enjoyable time if it wasn\u2019t for this awful system.","I created an account just to leave this review because of how stupid this game is.  What kind of idiot thought that only one user per console should be able to play or enjoy most aspects of the game?!?!  A second user not only cannot progress the game, does not get access to many of the recipes the first user does, and cannot make any significant impact on the island.  Why doesn't everyone get their own island?!?!?!?!?!  No one wants to get their own console just to enjoy a game.  This decision was asinine.  If there's a way to refund a digital download I would love to do so.  Can't believe I paid $60 for this.","Worst family game ever!!!! IT IS BASICALLY A ONE PERSON GAME.NO, YOU CANNOT PLAY TOGETHER WITHOUT FIGHTS!!! BECAUSE ONLY THE PERSON WHO STARTS THE GAME GET TO ADVANCE. THE REST OF THE PLAYERS ARE JUST LIKE VISITORS ON THE ISLAND AND HAVE LIMITED THINGS TO DO. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??? WILL BE RETURNING THE GAME !!!!","I am the second player, which is horrible. I\u2019ve found out, four days in, why I have not been progressing. Player 1 has all of the power. Player 2 just gets to sit back and watch things happen. I don\u2019t mind sharing an island \u2014 I think it\u2019s a great idea, but human villagers should have equal rights. I\u2019m done playing this. I hope Player 1 enjoys the experience alone.","Normally Nintendo releases games in great condition with minimal issues on release. However with New Horizons I am frustrated with how rushed the game\u2019s multiplayer functions. It truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind, with the split screen added last second. The first player to play the game being the ONLY person able to make any progress to the island makes zero sense. Until you realize that it\u2019s one island per Switch console, making it obvious that Nintendo is doing it for the money. Being the second player to play the game absolutely sucks. You can\u2019t even pick up items off the ground and have them go to your own inventory. You have to pass leader back and forth and if you accidentally pick up something while not being the leader, you have to go retrieve it from a recycle bin. The second player cannot even open their own inventory to equip items, they have to cycle through their favorites with X, and if you pass what you want you have to cycle through them all again. It just feels completely clunky when you aren\u2019t playing as leader. I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t simply allow the second player to also have inventory access, even if it\u2019s one player at a time. It also makes no sense at all why each account can\u2019t make their own island. Even if you buy 2 copies of the game, the second copy is essentially scrap because its all tied to the console itself. Bottom line is in order to let more than one person have the full game experience, they also must purchase an additional Switch console for their self, which is extremely greedy of Nintendo to do.","Really fun and relaxing game if you're the only one playing it on the Nintendo Switch. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE OTHERS WHO WANT TO PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT THEIR OWN SWITCH. Anybody else besides the first person to play the game on a single console is going to have a bad time. It's a single player game disguised as a multiplayer game. Each console shares an island so if the first player does all the things, there's nothing left for the other players to do and they cannot start their own island, there is only one.\r Shame on the designers or whomever decided that this was a good restriction to have. It's supposedly to curb cheating... CHEATING, in a non-competitive game. Instead it just harms the others who would like to have their own island and make their own choices.  it also makes Nintendo look greedy because the only way to get your own experience in a family is to have multiple Switch consoles and multiple copies of the game.\r I hope they get the message that people are really unhappy with this and feel swindled. Fix it please Nintendo.","Nintendo has done a great job keeping the consistency of the franchise over span of decades.  You have games such as Mario and Zelda where the gameplay matured with new hardwares.  You also have games such as Pokemon and Smash Bros where the core gameplay has been kept consistent.  I would keep Animal Crossing under that latter category.\r I have no complain about the gameplay aspect.  However, it is a great shame that Nintendo is keeping the multiplayer to be limited to one island per Switch.  If you are going to commit to account based system and let multiplay users to have their own account, you simply can not have this approach of locking different account holders under one environment.\r How awesome would it have been if you as a different user starts your own game and a new island emerges and you get to have your own experience.  And you can go visit your family members' island?\r It kinda baffles me why Nintendo did not go for this approach with superior hardware such as Switch.","Well I can't play the properly game since I let my sister play before me, I either have to delete her save and be a terrible brother or just let her play the game unless I buy another switch Nice one nintendo.","Game is completed ruined for all subsequent users if the first player to open the game and set up the island stops playing. I played for 10 hours as second player before realising this. Can\u2019t even unlock the axe recipe myself or participate in any island events. WHAT IS THIS DECISION? And it\u2019s not even communicated in game like \u201cOh, I can\u2019t give you that because Player 1 needs to do it first!\u201dGive each user their own island WTF","All of the positive reviews are from people who had the game to themselves. For a family it's just not fun that only one person can have the full game experience. There's really no good reason for it. The original Gamecube version in 2001 only required you have additional memory cards, not multiple Gamecubes. Now in 2020 we need multiple Switch consoles to do the same thing? Massive step backwards. Also, this game is nearly identical to every other version in every meaningful way. The quality of life improvements they added would be the equivalent of a free patch for any other major release, but in Animal Crossing you pay full price for a new game. Listen, I love the Switch and I love Nintendo, but it's a miss for me. If you never played an Animal Crossing game, and you want a very chill relaxed game to play, and you are the only gamer in your house, maybe you could give it a shot.  Or if you are just hopelessly addicted to Animal Crossing I suppose you might still think this is great. For everyone else: avoid it.","Complete scam. In order to access all the features advertised as being included in the game you are required to buy an extra Switch for every person in the household and a new copy of the game for each of them. I shouldn't have to spend an extra $1000 just to be able to play the game I already paid for.","Minus 9 points for 1 island per switch. You have to share all resources on your island with everyone in your house who plays which causes a lot of unnecessary stress. There is no excuse to have this restriction.","This game is fantastic. It is made with love and care and is packed with new features. It's pitiful that people are lowering ACNH's user score for a sharing an island (Animal Crossing has always had every user play in one town) and having to work more to make things (remaking tools is so simple and does add to the theme that you are exploring and creating this new island). The devs have supplied us with sooo much of what we asked for (literally the majority of what people did when hacking their saves in acnl). The team listened to the AC community and they should be proud of their work \u2661","While no master piece, this game is still a fantastic entry in the AC series. While it starts slow, overtime it introduces new concepts and QOL improvements that fans have requested for multiple entries. It also has limitless gameplay potential which means you can rack up a ton of hours without really trying. Some of the local options and shoddy changes hold this game back from a perfect score however, but this game is definitely worth the price of admission. The graphics are iconic and crisp and every song in the soundtrack is worth listening to. I'm only about 15 hours in, but I've seen what the game has to offer towards endgame and can't wait to build my deserted island into a bustling village! 8.5/10","I created an account just for this review. This is an amazing game and the calmness of this game is amazing. If you want to have a good time and just chill play this game.","An amazing entry in an amazing series. I love having the ability to craft and customize my own furniture, and this game gives you way more power than you've ever had to make your town exactly how you want.\r Opening the gates to your island and just hanging out with friends while you fish and catch bugs is so much fun. This game came out at the perfect time given current circumstances.\r I'm not time travelling, and I'm enjoying the laid-back pace of the game. Every day gives you a small task to complete and a new visitor to your island. Taking things in slowly gives you a good idea of the aspects of the island you like and what you should change later.\r If you're sharing a console, the inability to complete tasks for anyone other than the first user is a serious downside, but if you're playing this on your own Switch then it doesn't affect you. My partner and I are both enjoying the game on our own islands and it's unfortunate some people aren't having the same experience.\r A must-own Switch exclusive, but I'm sure you already knew that.","\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c.","The fact that they restrict multiplayer options so much is just sad, hopefully Nintendo notices the review bombing and actually updates the game to have fewer restrictions","New horizons is charming, has great music, and brings new ideas to the series without messing with the animal crossing identity.","A big fat ZERO. Why? Because I do not own a Switch but was going to buy the game and then borrow my son in laws Switch to play it on. But when I get my own Switch I'd have to start from complete scratch because there is no cloud save option and you cannot transfer your island to a different Switch. Was going to buy a Switch for this game, but now big N isn't getting a dime from me.","What an amazing comeback. I don't mind about the fact that you can only have one island per Switch. This put aside, it's a fantastic game, relaxing and wholesome. Perfect for this \"work at home\" period.","Well sadly I got to be the second islander, at first I was excited I got to live with my brother on the same island, but the problems started to appear soon there after... Basically there were no resources around, the other villagers are pointless, I can't even donate for building like come on man I want to help out. Nontheless it is a beautiful game, but I just can't play it basically, I can only fish and catch bugs to sell and that's it, I'm stuck in that same loop and honestly it can get boring.","Mucho mejor que new Leaf, es Genial como te mantienen ocupado con los tickets, en verdad hay gente que se queja por que debe pasar dias reales para hacer cosas, \u00bfAcaso solo compraron el juego por el mame?","Great game. Boring start, but starting from the third day on this ac starts to shine","I find it funny that there are those here complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per Switch. First of all, help the first person choose your island layout. Secondly, two heads are better than one in getting the first stumbling blocks out of the way so you can do whatever you want. My wife and I have our own Switches, and only one copy of the game. Mine is a day-one purchase Switch and hers is the new AC:NH themed version. We swap our single copy back and forth between our two consoles. Once we get a second copy, then we can do standard multiplayer. Right now, with the insanity going on outside our doors, this is SUCH a breath of fresh air. It's relaxing and sublime, and takes our minds of what's going on right now. And it has so much eye candy, it's ridiculous. I only drop it one point because we can't figure out how to trade fruit between our islands, what with us only having one copy of the game.","Animal crossing new horizons is a brilliant return after the disappointment that was amiibo festival.This game has you start on a desert island where you live your life.Nook miles are a new addition that makes and breaks the game at the same time,the game has things to work towards something previous entries lacked this is fun however it can get grindy and greatly limit freedom with things locked behind nook walls that ought to be unlocked.This game has it\u2019s polishing issues and bafflingly poor implementation of some ideas life travelling to new islands.The loading times are some of the worst in a video game 1-2 minutes the standard this is to load some of the best visuals in a switch game it looks like ps5 or even pc how this runs on a switch I\u2019m unsure .This game has the foundation of an excellent game but falls short due to a lack of polish despite this ,this is still the best one in the series topping new leaf.","This game is probably my favorite game and I\u2019ve only had it for 2 days.  I could not recommend this game enough, please if you have a switch go out and buy this game it is amazing!","First off let me say that the \"1 Island per Switch\" argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.\r Now enough of that.\r This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.\r The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the \"1 Island per Switch\" people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!","I don't understand why people are giving this game a 0 because of the lack of a feature that Nintendo said would not be in the game previously and that was not in any previous Animal Crossing games. I can understand that it can be bad for families that share a switch, but you shouldn't expect a feature that was denied by the creators of the game. Also, you shouldn't disregard the rest of the entire game and give it a 0 for one reason, you should still base your review on the other parts of the game, too.\r As for my review, I obviously can't say how good the entire game is based on my 3 days (unless I time travel), but it's been amazing from what I play. There's just so much to do, and I never find myself feeling like I did all I could for the day. There are also so many things that make the quality of life so much better. Some of these are simple things, like items automatically stacking or bells automatically going into your wallet, but there are also larger changes like the tool wheel. The game is also a lot easier to play for longer periods of time compared to New Leaf because it's not on a tiny 480p screen (not to discredit New Leaf, that is also a great game). Overall, I can't say how good the full game is, but I can definitely give it a 10 based on the 3 days I've played through.","Absolutely brilliant game, by far the best addition to the Animal Crossing series so far!I have played around 15 hours since the release day 3 days ago, and I love every aspect of it. The graphics are so much more crisp than the previous titles. The amount of in-game items is almost overwhelming (in a good way) and it gives me something to look forward to playing every day!","Let's begin by being extremely clear: this game is amazing. It deserves all the praise you've heard about it. It's fun, it's innovative for the series, it's really zen and, most importantly, it still conveys that sense of belonging to a community when playing.\rYou probably are also reading a lot of angry people saying that the game only allows one island per Switch console, and not per Switch user. That is correct. I agree with those people that this should not be the case. And while I can see it being an issue if you have multiple kids and or other people in your household that want to play different islands, I don't think that fact alone makes it deserve a bad score. Since that's about the only thing you'll read in the negative reviews.\r What things do I like about the game:\r-Graphics are gorgeous and cute\r-It's fun and adorable\r-It really helps out relieve anxiety}\r-It has steps taken into making sure other people can't destroy your island with the Best Friends system\r What things I don't like about it:\r-The multiplayer is a bit strange, specially to connect online to other people (but not a whole lot of an issue either)\r-The 1 island per switch is not ideal\r All in all, this is a 10/10 game. If you're the one player in your household, go for it. If you share the switch with someone else, maybe do a bit of research first and see if the restrictions are good or bad for your particular case.","Despite people pointing out the obvious flaws, which is that only one island per system can be created, despite being a feature that has ALWAYS existed in Animal Crossing even on home consoles, this game is a great addition to the already amazing series.","obsessed with this game ! been playing the series since i was 5 and new horizons is an amazing experience","People complaining about the one island per console thing forget that this is how Animal Crossing has literally always been. There\u2019s never been an Animal Crossing game where you have more than one town on a single system. Why would they change that now?","The game is exceptional. It\u2019s so much fun to build an island and watch it develop with each day. Every day there is something to do and goals to accomplish. Sure, the only having one island on one switch is annoying but not enough to detract from the game in a major way.","Like many people here said before: The game itself is fine BUT the way the game handles shared save files is ridiculously bad!! The worst I have ever seen in any videogame to be honest.There is only one shared island per Switch (not cardridge - switch) and the player that happens to be the first on the island is the only one that can basically \"play\" the game! The others are considered villagers and are more like active spectators, than actual players. There is no way to interact with quests or progress in the game if you are not the one person starting the game. My GF and I wanted to share this game, instead she is playing it 95% since I can not experience or progress the story at all. Until this is fixed I hope NOONE buys this game and forces Nintendo to patch this - I really wanted to play this.. I was hyped since its announcement. This just makes me soo mad at this game.","I'm honestly quite in love with the game, especially due to the current circumstances keeping everyone at home. It's a great new addition to the series, adding in an interesting crafting system along with a lovely rewards program right off the bat. While I do wish I could have my own island on the shared system I use, I understand it's in the same style as how animal crossing has been done in the past. It would be terrific if they added multiple islands as a possible update, but it doesn't make or break the game. The resources for the crafting system do feel slightly iffy,  as rocks seem to only spawn once per day and it takes fruit two days to reappear.  However the game is a yet again a terrific addition to the series and I look forward to all the futures events within it!","Only one island per switch? Me and my girlfriend were really looking forward to playing, game is ok but I'm not paying 300 on a new switch to get another island.","This is an incredible game for the first user to make a character. Anyone else who plans on playing only gets part of the action. Players 1 makes all of the decisions while everyone else has to wait on player 1. If player 1 isn't very active.... well too bad for everyone else. You must buy another switch for each person if they don't want to be treated as 2nd class. My family is so disappointed. We knew one island per switch was coming and we accepted that but the hamstringing of everyone but player 1 really kills the vibe. It also puts undue pressure on player 1 to make progress or feel guilty for holding everyone else back. Families don't need a game causing stress like that. We could just play monopoly or mario party if we want to have hard feelings with each other.","Although the game is beautiful and very inviting to play this only enhances my frustration with only being able to have 1 island per console and only 1 full game experience per console, don't label the game as an 8 player game when 7 of them are pointless!\r I got this game to play with my girlfriend and due to this big issue it has taken the fun away from us both being able to create and explore the game. I hope Nintendo fix this issue soon!","Having only one player pretty much be in control of the island sucks and is more of a single person game which was really disheartening. Stuff like this can turn fans away from playing the game again","Abysmal second player functionality. The progress in the game is locked by what the first player does.","EDIT:\rSome people just refuse to understand the situation so Im going to copy it directly from nintendo support:\rIs there a way to create multiple islands?\rYou can only create one island per Nintendo Switch system, even if you use multiple games. A different system is required to create a different island.\rThe island save data is saved on the Nintendo Switch system, so there will only be one island (save file), even if different games are used on the same system.\r If I purchase a second system, can I transfer the save file (island data) to a different console?\rAnimal Crossing: New Horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one Nintendo Switch system to another.\r Is this game compatible with Save Data Cloud?\rThis game does not support the Save Data Cloud functionality of Nintendo Switch Online.\r When multiple players live on one island, does everyone have access to the same places and items?\rThere are some tasks on the island that the Resident Representative (first resident on the island) must complete before the related features will be open to other players. For example, only the Resident Representative can receive and set up Blathers\u2019 museum tent.\rIt is not possible to reassign the Resident Representative role to another player. If certain places or items in the game aren\u2019t available for island residents, have the Resident Representative progress to the point where the item or feature is available for them, then try again.\r So for people who are trying to defend this by saying this was always the case with the franchise, firstly its not true, secondly its frikkin 2020, there is literally no logical reason for not letting people have multiple save files, the only reason is to make people buy new consoles.\rIf you intend to play alone, lucky you, but most of us don't. Think of a couple or a family with kids, don't tell me they should buy a new console for each family member just because \"the franchise was always like this\". Im sorry, but this is just BS.\r Original review: Was looking forward to play this with my wife, then I came across the information that the game is limited to one save per SYSTEM, so not even buying two copies of the game is enough, I would need to buy another switch just for this game... wtf director Aya Kyogoku and Producer Hisashi Nogami ?? why dont you want me to buy your game??","I thing the game is pretty good if you're the only one playing it, but i was a second player, and as a second player i give this game a 5. My sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it, and after i started playing too, as soon as i discovered that i couldn't create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf.\r Except this time it's worse and buying another copy of the game isn't gonna solve the problem, you have instead to buy a new switch, and I'm not really willing to spend \u20ac200 for a Nintendo Switch Lite just for animal crossing. At this point, i'd be happy even if they added multiple islands as a \u20ac30 dlc, even if i know that would upset many people, because that's something i can actually afford.\r I don't even really get why this is supposed to be a good marketing strategy, since most people are just gonna be like me and can't afford another console, the only people i could see buying multiple consoles are people like famous streamers or youtubers.\r Having only one island per switch would have been fine if all the players could do the same thing, but only the first player can progress, and since my sister plays a lot less than me i just feel like i can't do anything and my experience is extremely limited, and due to this i just can't really fully enjoy the game, knowing all the time that your experience is this limited for me is just annoying,\r This review is based on my experience as a second player and i get that you may have a different opinion if you were the first player. If i was the first player too i would probably have the same opinion as you.\r So long story short, it's not a bad game, but if you're the second player your experience is severely limited and you can't fully enjoy the game.\r I don't want to sound like just another review bomber who goes like \"game bad, Nintendo &lt; EA\", I hope i do not sound like one. Hope this sounds more like actual criticism. This is the actual first review I wrote, because i felt like i needed to share how and why i'm not completely enjoying the game.","My partner and I purchased.  We realized today that the 2nd user really is just a visitor and can't progress anything.  I really don't understand this logic here.  As it stands one player really can't do anything in the game until the other has time to move things forward.\r There are no separated save slots.  It does not matter if you have a unique nintendo login.  There is one island per switch and the first person to login is the only person that progresses/names the island.  It even limits how the 2nd player gets items.\r So completely avoid this title unless you are the sole player on your switch.  This was a waste of a purchase.  As it stands for a family household, it is actually $300+ to have a working animal crossing title.  Well, plus having a separate online account as well, lol.","Overall a really good game but it sucks that you can't play the on same island on a secondary console. My primary reason for me to buy the game was to play on the same Island as my fiance at the same time instead of this bad couch co-op. Or atleast be able to play the game split screened. I'm dissapointed. :/","I loved this game at first. My girlfriend turned me onto it as she had played the previous ones. I bought it for her on my switch as we live together and have been watching her play. She was having a blast so I I decided to join the fun! Upon starting a new player, I was shocked that I couldn't have my own island, but I thought that it wouldn't be an issue. So I joined her island and placed my tent, and started to gather supplies and fish. It was awesome! I played for 5 hours collecting all the fish I could and saving up money for the house. I figured I would help my girlfriend out and add to her projects to progress the island but quickly realized that my options for progression or helping progress were utterly null and void. I was disappointed but continued to play anyway until I could not go any further without my girlfriend (the main player) progressing forward. The next day my girlfriend and I were looking forward to playing local co-op, and I joined her game only to realize that my options for local co-op were also wholly lacking. Not only could I not access my inventory, but I also couldn't interact with anything. Not to mention that anything I picked up not only didn't get saved to my player, but it also didn't get saved to my girlfriends player; it just got shot to some community box in the Community Center. I was reduced to pretty much just following her around running in circles.\r Safe to say that was the last straw. I went from being utterly enamored with the game, shouting praise to my friends, to being completely turned off. The only way for me to enjoy it would be to buy another switch for $300 and another copy of the game for $60, and I'm not going to spend $360 for one game.\r The game is great otherwise, and minus the lack of multiplayer and almost disrespect from Nintendo to the 2nd player, I would have quickly given this game a 10.","http://chng.it/cBh8N9py this link sends you to a petition to get more than one island per switch. If we want to make change, we are going to have to do something about it. According  to most people who purchased the game and are not sharing it, they are getting an incredible experience akin to Fallout 3 (genre notwithstanding). The only reason I make this statement is due to the fact that if you are player 2 expecting to have as much fun as player 1, the second player on Animal Crossing: New Horizons is basically getting an experience similar to Fallout 76., which basically means there are no resources and no reason to progress through the game. The fact that this game doesn't allow more than one save file PER SWITCH tells me that Nintendo is trying to RIP people off, and I beware sick of these companies making decisions that try and sway people into spending more money so they can have the same experience as the other person in the house. Beware, even during a quarantine, only the first  account has access to do anything remotely fun on this game. If you plan on playing this game after someone else has started an account, just be weary of the fact that you are basically getting a watered down version of the game with no replay value whatsoever. I purchased this game, and now that I started an account after my girlfriend, I basically wasted 60 bucks, and honestly, I'm kinda thinking this is a sketchy attempt at getting people to purchase separate Nintendo switch consoles just so they can have the same experience as the first person's account. Nintendo, please do the right thing and allow separate saves so I can at least enjoy this game. I purchased this game for 60 bucks, but I'm getting a crappy experience because you all took away a feature that is literally in 99% of video games. I've never heard of not being able to have at least one extra save file. Change your ways or these 0 reviews are going to increase.","Typical nintendo being 2 decades behind the times when it comes to basic features we expect from games. One island per console.... The people who share the island with the p\"primary owner\" end up getting a half baked experience.  This game should allow multiple account Dave's on a console. Like every game for the past 20 years.","The fact that they force you to buy another switch to actually be able to enjoy the game if you\u2019re not the primary player is so greedy i have never seen anything like that, disappointed.","I like the game. Would rate it a lot higher, if it weren't for the shared island or one mayor of the island thing. My GF started our Island. And I wouldn't have a problem with her being the mayor and all. I even like the fact that we share the island.\rBut I can't even contribute to building the houses for the new residents which made my interest in the game drop immensely. Feels like the first player is getting a lot more out of the game which sucks in my opinion. At least make it optional so everyone can contribute and everyone gets the same furniture and all...","I don\u2019t even care that the same console players must stay on the same island. My daughter is the primary resident and I take over after bed time, thinking I would advance through the games stages for the both of us. After paying of home loans, banking more than 100k in bells, and finding more that 25 species in less than a week; I was stumped as to why I couldn\u2019t get the recipe for an ax or shovel. I even banked up additional miles to buy the DIY recipe pack in the miles store, only to find out that I still need those original flimsy DIY recipes to even access them. After much frustration and research , I realized what the problem was. So now I have to what ? Go into my daughters account, get her through the stages so we BOTH have access to new things. So what is the point of having multiple players ? Who would ever think this was a good idea ? I\u2019m sure as hell not buying another console just to have my own island in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Bad form.","While the game is beautiful  and the game play is well designed I cannot over look Nintendo's greed. The fact that there is only one island  per switch is disappointing. it wouldn't be so bad if every player  after the first was not restricted  from doing in game story content. With out these story missions  the 2and player misses out on most DIY recipes  and cannot contribute  to building  the town. Seeing as this is the entire  point of the game its frustrating  that I bought this for my wife. And she cant enjoy the game because  of the limitations.  This was very frustrating  and demotivating  to her and almost  made her not wanting to play.  This shameless  attempt  by Nintendo  Nintendo to make families by multiple  consoles  is unacceptable.  Animal  crossing is supposed  to be about build and community.  Only the first layer has that ability  Unless this is patch ed I would avoid this game unless you are a single person with out family  members  that will want to play a FAMILY GAME .  I give this a 1","I love the look of this game and wish I were leaving a better review. Unfortunately my partner started playing it first and since we share a switch I can\u2019t create my own island. I was really hoping to have my own area to customize and my own story to progress through. Love my boyfriend, not looking to do any more couples decorating than we already do.Not gonna give it a Zero, because that doesn\u2019t reflect the large amount of work that went into this game. But I certainly won\u2019t be that interested in  seeing what it has to offer until I can start fresh.","Due to the one island limit and that the first player is the only one who can advance the story. Because of this it has made being a second player a second class villager. On top of that what was a storyline that you can do eventually a job as you are holding back your other players abilities. Making being the first player a job not fun.","Should have disclosed multiplayer limitations broadly. Having one player lead is bad, but not being upfront about it was the real issue. A few days in our primary player quit playing. I was stuck. I had to delete the island and start over in order to \u201cfix it.\u201d There is no way to change primaries apart from starting over which is dumb. We moved all our stuff to another island (we already had two copies) before blowing away 3 people\u2019s savegames. Wish journalists would ding the game for this. Again, it was a design choice just like the one island per Switch. I don\u2019t like it.","So you cant create more than 1 island per switch, and me and many other buyers of this game have to share their switch with someone, this limitation is ridiculous! The switch has the power to do so, and the only reason I see nintendo doing this is to increase the switch sales, this is just disgusting!","ACNH\u2019s one island per Switch console local multiplayer is a total money grab.","Kind of sucks when you have to share islands with people on the same switch. It just causes problems between people and overall is a whole mess. The game is still solid but if you\u2019re not the island representative then there\u2019s really not much to do because you can\u2019t progress through the story/quest. Not to mention, even if you buy the game cartridge you are still not able to make a different island with other profiles on the switch so it basically limits you to that one shared island. Nintendo is wrong for this!","Honestly this game got ruined for me. Today is my sister and I\u2019s birthday, so naturally I let her play the game first since that was her present. None of the promotional material out there warned me about the extreme limitations any player that isn\u2019t the first player to make the island has. It\u2019s honestly so frustrating that we spent 60$ on a game that I can\u2019t even play to the fullest unless I purchase a new switch console.Another thing that just absolutely frustrates me is that there is only one island per switch, making it impossible for me to enjoy the game just as fully as my sister. I\u2019m honestly considering never touching the game again due to these really trivial and frustrating game design choices. Nintendo should patch the game to make it better if they don\u2019t want their sales to plummet immensely in the next week.","Nintendo! Not everyone can just say \u201cOh, I will just get another switch then.....\u201d. But this is a really good game still. If you are playing alone, strongly recommended. This score 1 is just because how greedy Nintendo is. Even if, it is for keeping the SIMILAR tradition like the old games, this \u201cone island per console\u201d decision is still very inconsiderate under many situations.","ONE island?!  PER CONSOLE?!!!  As everyone else stated, this is a real jerk move by Nintendo. I have THREE in my household that play. I was the last one to log on. The experience is terrible if you\u2019re not the island creator....I don\u2019t play anymore...","Great game besides the fact the first player gets all the progression and basically all of the useful choices, while everyone else basically just gets told go buy another switch to get that experience even after buying a 60 dollar game , and if that's your defense piss off you clearly didn't pay for yours yourself. Like that makes evensense, oh the 60 dollar game screws anyone that didn't start up the game first ehh whatever quit crying spend another 260 on a new switch.... you sound dumb end of story.","It's extremely unfortunate that play is restricted like this. If I could have my own island, separate from my sibling's, I'd be fine if it couldn't access the internet or whatever. I don't need to visit anyone else's island! I just want my own place to play, honestly. Such a bummer!","I was wainting this game since last year  but now im really disappointed. I play with my brother and i cant experience the game as he does. Cause i cant do a s.. in the island. Its frustrating cause my brother take all the resources and do the fun things while the only thing i can do is fishing or catch bugs...Besides  that I think this new animal crossing is incredibly better than the other animal so im sad :(","I have requested a refund for my digital purchase of this title after discovering that the game is locked to one save file per console. Every other title we own for the Switch allows a save file for each account; there was nothing to indicate such a limitation would be in place. Ridiculous.","One island per console is a ridiculous and very disappointing design decision. In a household of four people, only one will have a full experience with Animal Crossing, unless the three remaining people buy their own Switch consoles just for this game alone.\r Having not played an Animal Crossing before, learning about this during my wait for the courier essentially killed all my hype.","One island per console pretty much ruins it. At the very least there should be an option to allow players on the same console to have equal power when it comes to decision making within the island.","Is it just me or is anyone else getting tired of Nintendo's game restrictions??I bought this game for my girlfriend with every intention of creating and sharing a island together but she arrived at the island first and now I feel like my island experience has been watered down. I'm unable to have my own save file and I'm unable to progress the game in any meaningful way. I'm basically a worker bee. Thanks for creating a wonderful innocent game and then drowning it with monetary restrictions Nintendo. I suppose you expect me to go buy another switch... Oh wait you can't find them because Nintendo doesn't understand what is expected of them","Sorely disappointed with the choice to make it one island only per console. Not only this, but to give essentially all of the power to the first user? It's a completely greed-ridden business tactic if you ask me. What I cannot justify is that this decision was made for a game released on a home console, one promoted and marketed to be played and shared with your family and friends. I've never played an animal crossing game in my life, I was so looking forward to it seeing as I had purchased the special edition console for my partner, and I was met with nothing but dissappointment, as all I can essentially do is place decorations and steal resources. As a first time Nintendo buyer, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth already.","Thia game has caused nothing but grief in my house because of the 1 island per switch rule","Ok so I actually created my MC account just to review this game. I read it had been review bombed on here so bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews, after owning for a week I can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing. Me and my daughter hammered Stardew valley for hours/days on end she has been so excited for this to replace it. The gfx are better and as a single player game she says its ok, but the multi player game they really dropped the ball so you can only have one island per console. At first I didn't think this was too much an issue we could both play on that island although I would have liked to have a separate island under my user account I can progress and send my character to hers it's not possible. One progressing player PER CONSOLE. Basically if you are the person playing with the island owner everything you do is pointless, items you pick up go straight in the island recycle bin. So you can switch leader but this is just covering up the fact this is equally pointless as what's the point nothing you do matters you may be able to access your nook phone as leader but then the other person's stuff just goes straight in the recycle bin instead. It's sad as my daughter is 8 she loves us playing games together she wants me to play this but it's just mind numbingly boring for the second player. The second player can pick items up they go straight in the town recycling bin so unless you want to run all way back there the leader may as well pick everything up as you are never more than a few steps away from each other as you as sharing the same screen, I basically spent hours just following her around like a dog on a lead, and every time I pick my damn bone up it vanishes into the village bin and only my owner can pick it out, following her doing absolutely nothing you can't even explore as you get teleported right next to them when you reach the edge of the screen. I can tell she's disappointed when I say you just play on your own but Jesus there is only so many hours you can spend pointlessly walking around after someone with no purpose what so ever and if you do get involved and pick some items up you have to walk all way back the town centre to pick them up and even then only the leader can access them so I pick them up we walk all way to town Square then she picks them out she even said I may as well pick them up in first place because then we don't have to run back and forth. I think to call this a multiplayer game at all is a disgrace. I'm not a review bomber just a very disappointed dad. We bought it for multiplay and we are playing Stardew valley again a week later that cost us \u00a310 years ago. I tried to keep the review serious but multiplayer is a joke so we had 5min fun her making me out silly outfits on, apart from that I honestly have had more fun playing with the old paperclip Microsoft office assistant. Everything switch seems to be a cash cow theese days, Nintendo asking \u00a359 for mario kart 8 deluxe still which is just a rehash of mario kart 8 that came out 7 or so years ago on their last gen console and super Mario Bros u \"Deluxe\", some crook in Nintendo saying yes let's take our old game bang deluxe on the end and re release it still for top money on the new console. I will not be buying another Nintendo game system. It's only getting 2 stars as a single player game it's alright but only one player can play single player unless you buy another switch and another game as all the other user accounts have to use the same island only the island owner can progress on. Just glad my other child is 2 and doesn't understand as I would be livid at the thought of having to buy another switch and game so he could play single player as well what a damn disgrace  I am utterly disgusted with this money grabbing joke of a game. Bottom line want a fun game to play with your kids get Stardew valley or Minecraft might be old but just as good and the price is spot on value for what you get. This game replaces nothing, better yet get a Windows 95 pc and have a conversation with the office assistant. PATHETIC... PATHETIC!!!!","If this game were made by ANY OTHER company than Nintendo they would have never gotten the free pass by critics this milquetoast sub mediocre uninspired trashbag of a game received.\r It's one of the worst games I've played on the Switch.  Where to even begin.\r For starters, the completely F-U Nintendo gave to fans of people that have multiple family members that play on their Switch is just beyond excusable.  If you aren't the main player account of the switch you a.)  Cannot create a different island b.)  Can't visit anyone online without linking and paying for a completely brand new online account and c.)  Can't actually advance the game AT ALL and have to wait for the main account player to actually progress the game for everyone else.  This is some ActiBlizzard level BS I wouldn't expect from Nintendo, scary sign for things that may be to come.\r But even if all that were fixed it's still just such a bad game.  There's NOTHING to do here!  Seriously what is there to do?  The crafting system is the most rudimentary I've ever seen in a game, the graphics suck, the dialogue - oh my GOD the dialogue is mind numbingly frustrating.  90% of it is meaningless, but it just goes on and ON and ON AND ON!!  You just sit there pressing the \"a\" button over and over again rolling your eyes that you have to sit through yet another endless bit of dialogue that goes in circles and circles, repeating the same thing he's saying over and over and OVER AGAIN.  For instance in a recent update there is a bunny that lets you know there are eggs to be found for a limited amount of time until Easter (or \"Egg Day\" as their PC overlords commanded them to call it).  That's all he says in essence, but it takes 20 freaking pages of dialogue going in circles over and over again that you have to sit through for him to say it.\r And on that note every single npc in this game just has literally nothing to say, like EVER.  No personality, no actual tasks to be done, no real interactions, NOTHING!  It's just such a bad game.  How anyone can enjoy this is beyond me.  Avoid it like the plague.","This delightful game is helping me cope with lockdown.  Having not played since City Folk, it's just what I needed in a new AC console game.","Nintendo is on a constant high note with the Switch.\rAnother best in the series for one more amazing IP.\r If you were on the fence about getting in to Animal Crossing there is no better time to start, and if you are a fan this is a must!","Best Animal Crossing to date. Crazy attention to detail, lots of freedom, the neighbors have more personality, even the Nooks have turned away from their life of crime and are pleasant to chat with this time around. Lots of sequenced events which feels fresh for the series, and there are lots of tasks to accomplish. If you want the game badly enough that you need your own personal island, you're much better off owning your own Switch and copy of the game. Otherwise enjoy the enhanced Party Play mode where you both get to experience the game together. Animal Crossing is a social game at heart.","The best game in the entire franchise. Refine and expand what your past installment did.","awesome game, incredibly fun. Makes me want to go to sleep irl earlier just to see what new things I will have on my island in the next day","Es un juego muy bien hecho, te sacar\u00e1 de tu rutina, a mi me encanta jugarlo con mi hija de 4 a\u00f1os, podemos jugar los dos a la vez y se lo pasa de maravilla","This game is pretty good,  it's good to see animal crossing back at it's feet (after that one garbage game on the wii u) the games charming, funny sometimes. and just everything animal crossing.","I have had to rewrite my review. I expected more content for player 2 after the first week and upgrading  buildings. Sadly this game is only meant for 1 player. If you are not the citizen representative then you are playing a very shallow game. Everything you can do is nothing compared to the first person on the island.\r Very frustrating experience since there are some great improvements to other parts of the game.","Juego excelente, y muy adictivo!!! 100% recomendable, a\u00fan y cuando no hayas jugado las entregas anteriores","Great game and so relaxing. If you liked the previous ones in the series you'll this. Many new features and enhanced but still charming graphics. Must buy switch and switch kite game","Extremely anti consumer game. Nintendo is only getting away with this because their fans accept anything from them","I am a single player that does not have to share an island, and who sees online interactions as a small quirk instead of a needed feature. This game is amazing for me.\r However, I am 100% in support of the anger and frustration my fellow users who have to share an island are experiencing. If I had to share with a sibling or my wife, I would be extremely angry. It just isn't fair that you don't get your own save file and agency. We all can't afford multiple game consoles for the sole purpose of having a unique save file. That is downright preposterous, and I am certain it was some big wig exec who decided that.","It is hard to give this game a lukewarm score, but that is what ended up happening with this game.\r From a gameplay standpoint, it is very surely animal crossing. It includes most of the features from past games, some which were lost including some bugs and fish. This is all nice. It is as expected.\r The good:\r-better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather\r-customization of your Island allows for making the exact town you want\r-putting furniture outside for the first time\r-nook miles gives daily and long term motivation to do many varied things in the game and allow for faster progress and reduce boredom\r-You now progress more than just your house and the store, which gives a better sense of growth\r-museum is way more pretty\r-custom items are an amazing addition, custom hats, shirts, pants, skirts, face art(think adding facial hair) , and even ground tiles can be added.\r The Bad:\r-Made multiplayer very poorly\r-multiple people in the same town cannot help add to growing the town, and can get soft locked by recipes that aren't given to them\r-Island tied to your console, not the game save on the cart or even your nintendo account/profile\r-you cannot transfer you Island(save data) to another console\r-Nintendo refuses to provide cloud saves for no good reason(claiming to prevent cheating and manipulation, even though time travel is still possible and used heavily).\r-Not enough new content. The game needed a new villager type or two. Needed way more new bugs, fish and fossils to keep me trawling the waters and carefully treading between trees. At that, different tree types would have been nice too.\r-crafting only 1 item at a time. It gets tedious and annoying to craft tons of items in a sitting. No idea why I can't craft 20 fish bait at once instead of one at a time, watching the animations over and over. That isn't gameplay, that isn't fun, that isn't relaxing.\r-Would have liked to see other static town NPCs make a return, especially bather's kin with the observatory and the cafe. The police dogs are also sorely missed.\r This had the chance to be the quintessential animal crossing, but it failed on all fronts and just became another iteration, a fun one, but nothing special. It isn't a Smash Ultimate, but if you want a relaxing game or just a return to the series, it is adequate. Just don't expect to enjoy any multiplayer, this is a very single player game, and be sure you have the switch console you want to have forever, don't settle for a console you don't want, because upgrading either means a new console, or losing ALL your game progress.","Animal Crossing is a charming game that is a fantastic upgrade from previous entries in the series. The game is visually gorgeous and adds so many details and things to discover for players. In the game the player has many options to make the island THEIR OWN through the freedoms of placing anything outside to terraforming it to your liking. I\u2019ve already put in almost 40 hours in and hope I can keep playing for a long time. While being limited to one island may seem terrible to many seeking their own islands on the same Switch Animal Crossing is meant to be a social expierence with friends and family members. Animal Crossing is also a large game for the Switch and as the switch stores user data on the console I\u2019d imagine multiple islands would take a large amount of space without an SD card. I\u2019ve enjoyed playing with my family and will continue loving this game that has so much passion and detail put into it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to relax or have fun.","I will only fix my score once Nintendo:Allows us to move the Resident Services building, get rid of the campsite, craft in bulk, and have additional islands on the same console.Otherwise I'd give the game an 8.","It's a great visit back to the series. I guess I'm not too blasted away by the one island per switch because my wife and I have had our own for various other reasons and games long before this, and it's not like it was a secret before the game launched.","I hate HATERS, i set 0 to all heaters! There is no anymore point in user score when just some dump haters set 0, and that mean NOTHING.","Bas\u00e1ndonos en c\u00f3mo funciona animal crossing y sus prestaciones anteriores por fin podemos mover a los vecinos y recolocar todo para tener el entorno ideal","Best game that I have EVER played! So much thought and care went into turning this into a genuinely immersive experience. Personally, the 1 island per switch problem didn\u2019t affect me as I have my own personal switch and my brother who also plays has HIS own. The characters are  way more lifelike than in Animal Crossing New Leaf and I feel like my island is truly mine. You can place furniture inside OR outside as well as building shops, bridges, ramps and even a giant robot! With the shops you can find carefully designed furniture and clothing! Most of the furniture you buy can even be customized into multiple styles, truly making it feel like yours! You can also craft your own furniture such as chairs, tables and beds! It makes it feel like you have a part in your island life. With the clothing  store you can buy hats, shirts, pants and more! Unfortunately this game has been review BOMBED by people who in the end won\u2019t make change! This is the best Switch game and I highly recommend. This game is a 10/10, not 5.7.","It\u2019s a good game, well designed, good art direction, lots to create. It\u2019s not a game for everybody, but if you\u2019re even a little creative you\u2019ll enjoy it and it\u2019ll be relaxing fun. However the game does drop a point for me due to the forced sharing of an island on the same console. It has always been part of the franchise, but it was largely due to technological limitations in my opinion. But sharing an island isn\u2019t horrible in fact it can lead to a much more interesting experience. If we ever get the option to have separate islands my score will go up to a nine. Long and short of it is: if you think you\u2019d like it, you will. If you\u2019re interested give it a try","Absolute Joy! It is just so fun and relaxing! And i hate you people who are bombing The reviews down cause u dont get your two islands per console **** you","I honestly think that this is one of the best games I\u2019ve ever played. There is so much attention to detail with this. I hope that they continue to update everything as time goes on to add even more content.My only issues with the game so far are:- It\u2019s slow to start so do everything you can and then skip your clock forward until you have the full museum and the store.- The cut scenes when people join and leave your island are annoying after a while and are far too long.- The island tours need to provide more of a benefit because if you have enough friends, you likely will have all of the fruit anyway.","why one island? and why not a speaker doesn't make any things? but i love timmy's paws!! and the game is very addictive","Love Love LOVE this new addition to the Animal Crossing saga. So many things to do and it is SO MUCH FUN!","Friendly, a nice online system. Everyday you'll find something new. The crsfting look so great","Seeing animal crossing in HD is amazing! Having to build everything from the ground up makes you even more eager to unlock everything. And the addition of nookmiles, that you are given for everyday tasks, makes the game even more addicting to play! As a former new leaf and wild world player I would definitely recommend this game.","Very fun and relaxing game, the design of the character are very nice, especially the animals like Tom Nook where you can even see the little fur instead of a simple color gradient, sure the game have its faults, but it is very accessible and everyone can enjoy it.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is the game the world needed at this bleak point in history. The island is beautiful, the dialogue is charming, and it fulfills the needs I want from an Animal Crossing game. If you come into this franchise expecting dramatic quest plotlines, you will be disappointed. This is a game about sitting back, making friends and enjoying a quiet life. Animal Crossing New Horizons is not a game that can be binged if you want to get the full experience. It's something you play a little of a day. I look forward to continuing to enjoy my island one day at a time.","Another great Animal Crossing installment. It keeps all the basics you love from the old games while adding new islands to explore and a fun crafting system.","Absolutely adorable, relaxing, and fun. Perfect for sheltering in place. It\u2019s extremely polished and improves on some of the more tedious elements of old games. It\u2019s truly spectacular.","People have valid concerns with the oversight of a single island on each switch, however I don't believe that makes the game a 0/10. There is truly some trash games on the eShop and New Horizons is not one of them. Since everyone is basing their review on this one flaw, I'll base mine with the fact that I don't share the game with anyone so the game has been perfect for me.","I dont think that one switch for one island is bad or good. I played the original games and hated them because it was boring to me. Now I get to go on and drop gifts off for my boyfriend in front of his house, hop over to my roommates island and hang out with either one and and drop gifts for them too. I think it's fun to see what's different when I wake up and discussing what to do or where to out things. It makes it more of a community game.","only one island per console is so stupid. update the game and fix the issue, it doesnt work well for anyone with multiple people playing on one switch. at this point it's just a waste of money that I should not have spent at all. if this is the new set up for games I will never buy another switch game.","If you have 2 people playing on the same switch all progress is locked behind the first person who loads up the game on the switch. you cannot have multiple islands and the second player cannot progress without the first one doing all of the progression stuff first. pointless and horrifically badly designed, how an oversight this large could possibly be made is beyond comprehension.","After the initial novelty wears off you'll get exactly as many hours enjoyment as you would sitting in front of a doll house.  If that's alot of hours then this game is for you.  Personally, I can't believe I wasted money on it.","I love this game, It\u2019s my first Animal Crossing. I love all the stuff to do, in this crazy world today, it\u2019s a nice relaxing game to get away from reality. My household has 3 switches though, so the single island to a switch thing don\u2019t bother me.","All AC games have had the one island per console gimmick. I don't like, but it was to be expected. The game is great, really fun and cute.","Same criticism of the game as others here...the single island per switch limitation means I'll never get to play the full experience of the game as the secondary AC player in the house. This single decision (also not helped by the lack of real save game backup) is enough to ruin an otherwise excellent game. If people can't play it, can it really be any good? No.","Game is fun to play. The one island per switch console thing is a joke in this day and age. Average game and overall good time waster. Too bad the overall features are stuck in the past. Online enabled with events and multiple islands per family could have made this a classic. As it is - a graphical update of a GameCube game","It's an awesome addition to the series! Those who are complaining about the multiplayer obviously aren't familiar with the early series. It's got great features and the Nook miles are a clever way to make mini objectives so it's not just build the biggest house and fill the museum. Lot's to do!","great great game, haven't had so much fun in a while, me and my mom live on the same island, it's been pretty fun doing stuff together, don't mind the review bombers everyone, the game is godlike.","super fun game, just really unfortunate that i got it to play with my boyfriend on his switch and since i was the first person to make a character i am the only one granted to perform all of the more fun tasks that make the game what it is. in other words only the first person who makes an account gets to pick the island and where everything goes and upgrades etc... anyone else after may still love on the island but they do not get their own and do not get to complete any tasks. so if you\u2019re planning to buy this for your kids to share, don\u2019t. seems like nintendo just wants everyone to buy all their kids switches and guess what? more games. pathetic.","Everything about this game is amazing. I've been a continuous player of the series since the gamecube version, and every game they release just gets better and better. The feeling of accomplishment when getting nook miles completed, your house upgraded, and unlocking all of the shops and DIY projects is so great! This game has been the best yet, and I hope they never stop making it!","Would be a 10 but multiplayer really wasn't handled well, and it's disappointing that you can only have one island per switch. But other than that it's a near perfect game in my opinion and it's been hard for me to out down.","This is my first animal crossing game due to the fact that it's the first that interested me. The single player offerings and online multiplayer and almost flawlessly executed. Online joining could be smoothed out a little. The fact that you can only have one island per switch is forcing people to not do local co-op  play if they want a private island. I personally think this game is a 8.5-9 rating but since people are giving zeroes due to the the single island and online issues I give it a ten to try and help balance out the scores.","I have played evey animal crossing going back to the game cube and this game out shines them all","Love this game!! Sorry to all the people who didn't do their research before they purchased the game and are mad about the single sole console multiplayer options, but this game is still incredible. There is so much to do and so many goals to achieve, it makes me so excited for the future of the game.","I\u2019ve been playing AC games since the very first one came out and I\u2019ve never been disappointed. But NH has gone above and beyond any expectations I had. I\u2019ve been playing non stop since I downloaded it at midnight release and so have my friends. I\u2019m excited to see what new seasons bring, events, and other things. I think Nintendo nailed Pocket Camp (the animal crossing phone app) and if this full fledged game continues on that success, which I believe it will, then this will be something to play for a long long time!","No, no, **** no.\r The most boring, overrated annoying game. Imagine if you will that you pay 60 dollars for a game where you run around collecting sticks and **** and then have to wait till the next day till you can do anything remotely interesting. Multiplayer is a nightmare to set up. What kind of game makes you wait days to weeks to be able to do 'fun' things. People keep mentioning that you build relationships with the villagers, well that's the biggest piece of whale **** i have ever heard in my life. If i read what I just told you to anyone else but didn't mention the name \"animal crossing\" you'd think that this was one of those ads you see for mobile games. You are paying 60 dollars for a **** mobile game. I will admit as far as I saw there was no micro-transactions.\r I have a little sister who also plays the game. Well to my realization since she is player 1, she basically in control of the progress and I am left to do whatever the **** till she progresses things forward. I cannot make my own island. What kind of backward thinking is that? Mindless drones will tell you that the other games have always been this way. This is **** 2020, there's absolutely no excuse to enforce this. It doesn't cost them extra money, extra resources or extra thinking to get rid of this bull****. In fact, it probably costed them time and resources TO MAKE IT WORK LIKE THAT. It's a clear attempt by Nintendo to force the purchase of a second switch along with a game cartridge. Absolutely disgusting and not in the least bit warranted for what is a ****ty mobile game.\r Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game. I promise no matter what reviewers will tell you, its all bull****. Do you really wanna sit for 3 hours collecting sea shells and wood to sell. All that just to achieve absolutely nothing?\r I recommend you try Stardew Valley instead. The characters have far more depth. There's a story to tell. The characters you meet are not all generic furry fetish toys who apparently all need to work out (talking about the **** weird rat, ace).","The best ever. Those who are saying that the crafting system and breakable tools just want instant gratification. That is not the main point of the game!!!The BEST EVER","One of the best games I've ever played in my life on any console. If you disagree, you are incorrect and live a dismal and soulless life.","My kids share a switch.  I have my own and didn't want to fight with them over who got to play so we bought 2 copies of the game (digital download for mine, physical cartridge for the kids) and my kids both contributed towards 1/3 of the cost.  And now we find out they can't have separate files or have their own island?!!!  My son is devastated, we're all stuck in the house together because of the pandemic and he's too young to understand corporate greed is why he can't play a game he had to contribute a significant amount of his allowance towards.  I've been a loyal Nintendo consumer for almost 40 years and this is the thing that's going to drive me to Playstation/Xbox in the future.  I won't buy another Nintendo game unless they fix this ridiculous mess.","I would love to rate this game higher as the content you can do is perfect for relaxing and such when you're able to. But being the second person in this game means that you are heavily restricted on what you can do and your progress is limited to how far the first person gets on their own. I can live with having only one island per switch, but not being able to do everything because I signed in second is just disgraceful, I either have to live with not being able to do everything or have to buy a whole second switch. It would be so easy to let the second or more players to do things like build bridges or to place resident houses, but I will never be able to unless I reset the whole game just to make me the main character. If they fix this then I would totally recommend this game, but until then I say don't give Nintendo your money.","This games really fun to play solo and I recommend getting it if you haven't already got it ","It hides the fact that only the first player actually is a full player from you. Ruining some major features.  Fix this sh!t, and it'll be a great game.","The island locking honestly broke the entire experience for me and my entire family. Very disappointed with Nintendo.","I love New Horizons! So much fun and so much to do! I love the graphics as well!","The game is okay but the local multiplayer experience is terrible. One island per console is not so bad, but the fact that subsequent players cannot progress in the game and only the first player (who becomes the island representative) can advance the island is nonsensical. Also, many DIY recipes are only available to the first player, so if I want a bed in my house I have to get resources, give them to my gf (who is the first player) and have her make them for me and then get them.\r It is clearly a move made so that Nintendo can sell more consoles and greatly anti-consumer. Hopefully if we get angry enough about this they will change that, otherwise they have no reason to.","While animal crossing is a great game a few things from Nintendo really ruins this game. One is the fact that you get One Island per Console! My family has one switch for 3 users meaning that I had to start on a island which was already developed. So to have the full experience I would have to by a new switch. Secondly, Nintendo seems to be taking down most of the videos made of this game including pure gameplay. I've clicked on many videos on animal crossing which then said Nintendo took it down due to copy-right. So overall it is a good game tarnished by another greedy corporation.","The one island per switch is a real bummer. It's less a feature and more a restriction (especially if you're the second player) It feels like Nintendo is trying to force consumers to buy a second switch (or more).","1 island per switch? Seriously? I'm glad I sold my switch to a friend. Wont be buying another.","Bought because my girlfriend was so excited to play, I worked nightshift the next day so she told me to play first at midnight and report how good it was. I thought it was great until I realized that my girlfriend was player 2 and was greatly upset that she had no progression or objectives in the game. The fact that Nintendo would think in any way that this is appropriate. Thank god I don't have kids to fight over who's a mayor!","I am reviewing this as someone who is not playing as the \"island representative\" (not the primary player).\rNintendo's decision to limit the actions of people playing local multiplayer is garbage. They are telling people who love this franchise to buy a second switch or go f*** themselves.\rMy partner bought the game for us to play together and 6 days in, they have almost 40 furniture recipes and I (who has played the same amount as they have) only have 15. The game severely limits what the second+ players can do in the game to the point of making it feel like a bad animal crossing game.\rI'd even accept being able to buy all the DIY recipes the primary player receives, but at the time of writing this is impossible and player 2 will NEVER be able to build a peach chair.\rIt's so strange that Nintendo would acknowledge that the Switch is a console that is sharable and to be used by more than one person (Pokemon SWSH allows multiple save accounts per switch so they know several people will play each game on a single console) but turn around and make the game so garbage for everyone but the first to play it.\rI'm sure I'd love the game if I started playing first, but speaking as someone who did not, fix your s*** Nintendo.","The fact that the primary player (the first person to play the game) is the only person who has full access to the game is nonsensical. Basic features such as obtaining tools are locked to secondary players if the primary player has not unlocked them yet. This makes it hard to play the game as a family. There cannot be cooperation to share an island if members on the island are not equals. Moreover, there is no indication when you set up the game that primary players will be the only account with full access to the game. This means if you set an account up for your child, parent, partner or any other player who will not play it full time, you can only progress insofar they have unlocked these features for the game for you. Very annoying and seems like either Nintendo has done this for financial gain or they do not have the ability to have more than one island on each save file. Take your pick","The one island thing is stupid. Zero cloud save is even worse. I fully regret buying this game.","Great single player! I don't know how they messed up multiplayer so badly. The restrictions are mind boggling. They made it seem like you could do so much. But you really don't have any player interaction either.","I was really looking forward to this game. So I spent the first day getting my island in order and planned out. I was excited to get to play with my husband and kids...then I find that they don't get their own islands. What a waste...if we wanna play together we've got to buy more switches..and copies of the game. Greedy much?  Nintendo is the new Coronavirus.","Could have been the best Animal Crossing game to date but nope, Nintendo has to ruin it by only allowing one island per game. Girlfriend loves the game, I absolutely hate it now.","This game is undeniably adorable and super fun, unless, like me, you are the second player on the same switch system. Then the game locks you out of all consequential decisions and you have to wait for player one to progress as a passive resident on the same island.  The only way to get the full experience is to but another switch system. This is absolutely not acceptable and has destroyed and fun I was having in the game.","Trying to make households buy multiple switches because they can't make their own islands and being locked behind player number ones progress.\rSmells like EA","Well first let me say that I'm not here to bash the game but this needs to be fixed. I bought the game, digital version and now we may ask for a refund. Yes I like the game but its a cute thing to say we decided to go with only one island per console so families could comucicate and co-operate. If we could at least..    We all love the game butwe feel like nintendo made many poor decisions with this one, what could be the best game (well it is if your are the only one playing).... I'm lost for words, Nintendo you are becoming like every bad companies in there, jsut Greedy","Every single Animal Crossing entry has been 1 island per console (per memory).\r Ignore most of these reviews from players who are salty and clearly havent played Animal Crossing before.","the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn\u2019t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. You have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience. That's unacceptable. Nintendo is acting alot like EA in this buisness practice.","I'm really disappointed by this Nintendo game. The fact that you can only play on one island on one console even if you log in through different accounts and only the Player Nr.1 can actually make progress in the game is very frustrating. I will return the game because Nintendo unveils prehistoric strategies to force the people to buy more nintendo switch consoles. For bigger families and couples it's even more horrible.Sorry, Nintendo.Very bad Move","The game could be fun but I however am stuck being the secondary player on the console so I have no freedom to play how I want, I am stuck as a passive villager on an island I have no say in","I was very disappointed with this game. I love the animal crossing series, but I am not a fan of new horizons. The game itself is amazing, but I can't play it. The fact that only the first resident can make changes and progress the island is infuriating, my little sister demanded to play first and now she has no idea what she's doing, and I can't play the game I paid $60 for. Unbelievable.","The game is great if you plan on playing alone. There are no multiple save files to support multiple islands which creates a huge problem. Do not buy this game if you have multiple people who are interested in playing. You all share an island and all the resources. You would have to buy an additional switch console for any player who wants their own island. It comes off as very anti player.I'm very disappointed in the developers decision to force people into the choice of not playing or buying another switch and copy of the game. What other game can you think of that would force a player to make that choice?","even with the limitations, the game is still a solid game. an amazing game if you just want to relax and just chill. easy to pickup for casual gamers.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it's origins... if you're the first player. I bought this game in hopes that I could share it with my sister, but those hopes have been crushed. I started the game up first, as it's sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family, and I had no idea that I was taking away so much freedom from my sister by doing that. When I heard \"one island per console\", I assumed that the island would be the same on different save files. Both me and my sister could transform that island into whatever we wanted. But, sadly, the grim reality is that she can't do anything on my island. She can do the basic things: catching bugs and fish, shaking trees, paying off her debt etc, but she's left out of doing anything important. Any important progress, like choosing where the buildings and bridges go, is only reserved for me. She's not allowed to have the fun of collecting resources and building our island up from the bottom, and it has ruined both of our experiences. I feel guilty personally knowing my sister, who was greatly looking forward to the game, is extremely disappointed and heartbroken at this development. She can't have fun, and I can't play the game without feeling a sense of guilt. Nintendo absolutely needs to fix this. The game itself is wonderful, I've been having a great time playing it myself, but I can't rightfully advocate for this game when it's been such a huge letdown and disappointment for my sister. I don't even mind if they keep the \"one island per console\" rhetoric, as long as my sister has the same freedoms I do. If Nintendo wants us to play together, then why are they restricting everyone except for the first player? It makes absolutely no sense to keep true to the friendship and bonding aspect to the game if you're literally making that impossible by both restricting any second player onward and making couch co-op practically unplayable.","I really wish I could give the game a 10 but the decisions made in order to make money from this game are so greedy. It is intentionally set up to make people buy multiple consoles per household.I initially got over the \"one island per console\" aspect, however the fact that I can't make any island decisions or lose out on DIY recipes because I didn't play first is ridiculous, there should at least be an option to change the representative of the island. Another issue is that the multiplayer aspect was heavily advertised but is really clunky and awkward. I was really excited for both of us to have friends on the island but you can't cross local and online play, meaning only one person can play while a visitor is on your island. Im just really disappointed because the game has the potential to be spectacular, and if you're a solo player with no other players in the household it is great, but rather than try to make the game as enjoyable as possible for everyone, they decided to make it less enjoyable for secondary players in the hopes people will buy multiple consoles.","1 island per console means that after splitting the game 50/50 with my girlfriend I feel like a player 2 being unable to do most things. This issue needs fixed.","One island per Switch, I wanted to play the game with my girlfriend, but as the second player she doesn't have the same rights I do, which is just a poor decision by Nintendo","Pretty upset that my wife played first so now I can't even have my own island to play on and work on myself. I can only go and help out hers now. Such an old and upsetting way to handle game saves, Nintendo. Let's see if you do the right thing and fix it","Pretty underwhelming to be honest, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't plant to play it with friends or if you're new to the game and if that's the case I recommend that you play any of the other previous games and if you like it then wait some months and then buy it, because this game isn't worth 60 bucks.","I think the game actually seems to be a good game as far as animal crossing goes; however, with a family in which many people want to play it doesn\u2019t work for us. Yes you can share 1 island, but that\u2019s very difficult for children and while I would be willing to buy multiple copies of the game to have multiple islands it\u2019s ridiculous to limit it to 1 per console.In modern times and on a game in which no competitive benefit is gained its silly for AC to have become more and not less restricted.","Good game but the one island per console is a joke. Was really looking forward to sharing this game but can no longer do it as there's the one island. The second person has no power to do anything as well which doesn't make sense either.","Ninteno is 20 years behind in gameplay. 1 island per switch, no save transfer, even in local co-op only 1 person can help to make anything. I think they are just trying to force people to buy more copies and buy more switches. Unrelated... they unfairly copyright claim videos to make them unwatchable.","The game is amazing and beautiful but just like a lot of others I am done with this Greedy mother@@@##!!!#@ s 1 island per switch yea f#@% you Nintendo","The obvious very big thorn here is the very poor application of limiting more than one player on one Switch from playing the full game. I bought this for my wife and I to play and as the second player, I cannot advance the game and am limited to minute tasks that make no difference toward game progress. Nintendo really kicked themselves here. I have always had very high confidence and trust in Nintendo until this point. If this is the stuff they\u2019re going to pull, I will be very very hesitant on purchasing any future titles, which is sad. This could be a great game, but for a family wanting to play, the limitations bombed this score for me. What a disappointment.","Love the atmosphere and game-play, but I'm horribly disappointed that I cannot back-up or transfer my data to a different switch? What if the Switch gets broken? What if it is being used by a different family member? This makes no sense at all, please change this policy! If it was implemented to cut down on time cheaters, you already failed at that one.","I have never before had my children fight and cry over a blasted video game.  Incredibly poor design with no consideration for multiple players/instances.","I have 2 kids. Both want to play this game so badly. BUT both can't play unless I buy ANOTHER switch AND ANOTHER game copy. My girls were very excited when I got this for them, now they're sad and both offering to let the other 'be player one' because only ONE PLAYER PER SWITCH PER GAME COPY can actually play, the other one pretty much has to sit around and pick their nose. Thanks Nintendo, your stupid, pointless, greedy decision on a kids game has made my kids very sad, at a very bad time for them to be sad. I offered to get them Doom Eternal, which they can both play. That game rocks... but they just want to play their cute island game, which they can't... for no reason... kids, eh? Fix your stupid game. Make kids happy. Please.","I'm so torn on this game. For a single player, the game is fine. It's exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game. If, however, you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend, you might as well give this game a hard pass. Nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features, and has implemented what I can only describe as hardware based DRM. The first player to boot up the game will automatically become the \"primary\" player, meaning that the game cannot and will not allow any other player from progressing the game. Each individual user profile CANNOT make their own game to play and they will all share the island.  Yes, each switch can only have ONE island. It's not so bad if you are playing together but as two separate people playing at different times, anybody other than the first player is little more than a glorified visitor. When the first player progresses and unlocks furniture that can only be unlocked through progressing the game (save for complete rng gifts) the other players get the shaft and don't get the recipes. They have no way of acquiring many pieces of furniture. Other players can't have conversations with villagers, take progression requests from Tom Nook, or even deliver materials for a request that the primary player has already gotten. They cannot teraform, build bridges, pick out plots for houses, they can't even use emotes because a villager has to tell you about them before you can use them, but villagers won't talk to the other players.With the amount of things the other players CAN'T do there might as well not even be multiplayer.And this is all before mentioning the excruciatingly slow and tedious menus. You have to go through 3 prompts just to open your island up to friends. The menus function as if they were designed for a 3 year old to be sure they know what they are doing. Every. Single. Time. You catch a fish it has to zoom in, play an animation, and tell you that you caught a fish and say some dumb fish pun.Oh and any time somebody comes to your island, for some reason the game has to take you to a 30 second loading screen. Incredibly tedious if you have more than one friend. Why can't I continue playing while they load in?All in all the game Is held back tremendously by all the completely ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions, but that's good ol Nintendo for you. Any other company would be thrashed for the amount of ridiculous limitations Nintendo has put in animal crossing.","See, reviewing \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" is quite hard because you're essentially reviewing two games. The first game is \"Animal Crossing: Representative's New Horizons\", the other is \"Animal Crossing: Build a house\".\r The thing is, is that if you're the representative then this game is great. You get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events, progress through the game, and just relax and have fun in general. It's a crying shame that Nintendo didn't see this extreme design flaw, because otherwise I would've given this game a 10.\r Normally on the Nintendo switch, you can play one game on multiple profiles, letting families and such other groups have an equal amount of fun in a singleplayer game on a single switch. Now, Nintendo had the 'great' idea to make it so you can only have one island per console. Animal Crossing treats the switch as a huge save file. Now this would be fine, if all profiles/users of the switch could contribute to the island. Well no, only the representative has any control of the island, which means any other player can literally do nothing in the game at all. This is so extreme that I had to look at tutorials to see how I could get the recipe for the axe, which turned out to be that I had to pay for it. To get the vaulting pole? I had to go onto my sisters account and give bugs to Tom Nook just so I could progress. This issue is so extreme in fact, that most of the time you'll have to pay bells to get tools, either that or wait for the representative to do something specific. Now you can probably see why this would suck for a family or a friend or couple, but this gets worse. There is near nothing a second player can do in this game other than develop their house, that's it. This game turns from a relaxing game where you can have fun and develop your island, to a house maker simulator. This oversight really nukes the enjoyment of the game.\r Overall, I hope Nintendo can fix this big issue and restore my enjoyment in the game, for now though this has killed any will in me to continue playing. For now, I have to give this game a 1 due to my personal experience.","Very disappointing was excited  to have my own island but had share and 2 player mode is awful why isn\u2019t spilt screen the fact we can\u2019t make more islands is worst than EA f*ck you Nintendo. I feel very lost doing things I\u2019m new player and there is no real sense of direction and it took me 20 to figure out how to fish","DO NOT BUY ANIMAL CROSSINGEspecially if you have more than 1 person that wants to play on the same switch.Each switch is allowed 1 save file.Not each profile.Each individual Switch unit.So if you have a partner, or kids that are excited to start their own island and play, get ready to disappoint.What a gigantic waste of money","I don't understand why is it one island per console. Also implement better activities for Co op even if you have 2 consoles there's not that much to do.","Incredibly pissed - I just wasted my money and now Nintendo is gonna have to hear me **** about it. This game only enables ONE save file per switch. I bought this game for my brother, sister, and I and now only one of us can experience the full gameplay since the founder is the sole person to make decisions that impact the island. I have countless switch games that enable multiple save files and are the same price if not cheaper. This is incredibly overpriced and poorly designed. Although this game does deserve many of its raving reviews, if you share a switch with other people it is a waste of money. Looks like I just bought my sister a sixty dollar game. Great. I hope you repent for your sins Nintendo and stop shoving money up your buttocks.","I really enjoy animal crossing, this game is great, if you are the first player to play the game on the console, I see no reason why they would make it so that every user on the console has to share an island and that only the first user to play it can enjoy the full experience of the game. It ruins the game for me as I let my brother play the game first, I play the game more and I am unable to do everything he is able to do. this is what happened to me, I was going to pay half for animal crossing and my brother was supposed to pay for the other half, but we played the game for a while and found out that the second player is extremely limited to what they can do compared to whoever played the game on the console first- not just when you're playing together, but when you're playing alone, just because you weren't the first to play the game on the console- it's a huge letdown. I really like the game, but I can barely do anything, even when I'm playing alone just because I wasn't the first to play the game on the console, and It's like that on purpose, so I doubt they'll fix it. I'll have to buy a whole new console and copy of the game just to get the full experience, while my brother gets to play it normally.\rI'd rather not even play it at all.","Firstly, I would like to say that this game absolutely worth the wait. It is clear that the development team put in a lot of effort and care into each detail, interaction and activity, and is what makes this game so charming to look at and play. Secondly, whilst I understand that Nintendo are being a bit greedy with money, these review bombs are utter rubbish as they complain about something that has been a part of Animal Crossing from day one: the fact that one copy of the game comes with one town or island in this case. They even addressed this in the direct. People enjoy complaining to gain attention it seems. And lastly, this game may have its faults and short comings (as no game is perfect), but it has a good sense of longevity. It's a game you can play for years to come.\r My score: 9.8/10","Well, my brother and I just found out that he can't create his own island on Animal Crossing or actually do much of anything since he's considered to be Player 2 and needs me to do everything before he can :T\r This sucks and just feels like Nintendo trying to force us to buy not only a second copy of the game, but also a SECOND Switch since there can only be one save file per Switch.","The game is amazing, but the fact that I have to get another switch so my girlfriend can play her own island is insane and is kinda EA levels of greedy. If only I could save my island to the cloud, or even my SD card, she could play, but that's all disabled for reasons.","I saw all the great reviews for this game so bought it for my wife and me to enjoy. I really enjoyed getting into this game but it all fell apart when my wife logged in to have a go. She tells me we have to share an island which I thought must be wrong! It's a modern 21st century game so multiple  ave files are surely standard. Nope.is meant that I couldn't collect resources she had collected to progress my game.I completed a mission on my next go and she then couldn't enjoy the mission in her own time. This now feels like chore to enjoy the game.As such I have deleted my data so she can enjoy the game at her own pace. Unfortunately I can't return this game for a refund, which would be my ideal solution, as it was a digital download.Fingers crossed for a patch to fix this poor decision","1. No transferring islands and characters to another Switch.2. Co-op is a joke and not fun.3. No option to have multiple islands per Switch.4. Only the first account to move into the island will have the full experience. While the rest of people that move into the island can\u2019t do anything to contribute to the progress the island. And will have to wait for the lead islander to do everything.5. What\u2019s with the removal of the gyroids?I got this game to share and build a island together with my girlfriend, but I can\u2019t without buying a second Switch. This game is great fun (alone), but these greedy intentional practices need to stop.","I played this game for a while and loved it, i probably put in 20 hours but I was struggling to advance the plot. I put in so much effort paying off debt and gathering resources and going to new islands to invite people to come live on my island and still nothing. Later I discovered I was missing a ton of recipes that the main player of the console also had. WELL! that was 20 hours wasted because apparently the second player on this game has no responsibility, can't advance the plot, is missing tons of craft recipes and is generally seen as a much less important player. I'm done with this stupid game and I can't believe I spent $60 on it. pisssseddddd\r Edit: I deleted the game, started over as the main guy, played for a while...even at its best this game is boring and shallow. The characters are all cookie cutters and one dimensional, the items that you find and craft have very limited to no functionality, the game play is designed to be as tedious as possible. Still pissed I spent $60 on this game. Stardew Valley is 1/4 the price and 200 times better, thus it is 800 times better. Get Stardew instead.","I am saddened by this game. I was incredibly excited to play, and seeing that there would be couch co-op I was even more excited since I could share the experience with my Fiance! BUT, I was disappointed. There is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control. All materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood, hit all the rocks, and dig up anything from the ground... there will be nothing left for player two. Your best bet is to try and save up miles and visit a mystery island... which is annoying as hell. Player two can't help build homes and you can't trade bugs/fish between players either. This all has been very frustrating since my Fiance hasn't had much fun playing alongside me. The game itself has some odd mechanics too. Fishing and digging are hard as hell. There is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target. Crafting items is a **** and a half. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to click to craft, watch the animation, then click back in to craft again. Repeat until you build as many items as you want. Super time consuming and annoying. All tools will break eventually, and I wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break. I do enjoy this game while playing alone, but it's a real bummer that we can't have our own separate islands and have equal participation. If that gets fixed and the other minor things change, I'll be happy with the game, but for now, I am disappointed.","The game seems like it could be fun, but the ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE limit is a deal breaker. Social islands are a neat idea, but shouldn't be shoved down the throat of gamers. This is my first time ever playing an Animal Crossing game, and im stuck as a resident on someone else's island with no control? No thank you.Nintendo seems to be saying \"You don't want to experience this neat feature we came up with? Well WE think you really have to. This game is not for you.\"","Disappointed. My partner and I bought this game for our Nintendo Switch and while she's player 1 and enjoying the game very much, I have no enjoyment or desire to progress with the game due to the ridiculous and downright appaling decision to limit one island per switch rather than one island per user. That is all.","The  game is beautiful, and arguably thus far the most relaxing title in the series thus  far. Most negative user reviews are complaining about something that has been true since the days of the Gamecube release (though technically, the GC game was limited by needing another physical memory card, not another console). The game allows for only 1 town/village/island per console. This facilitates sharing an island with your family, but removes the ability for each person to be in charge of their own island. This *can* be a deal breaker for some people.","This games save features and coop features are broken and make the game useless for more than one person to play it. It\u2019s an abomination. Do Not Buy.","Can't progress in the game because my wife started playing first and all game progress is tied to whoever plays first. Holy crap dumb game design. Hopefully will get patched with a fix as soon as possible.","The one island per console thing should be a warning on the purchase screen. What an asinine way to limit the use of a switch to one person.","I took the game back and returned it the moment I saw you aren't allowed to make multiple islands. The decision wasn't even greedy since pretty much no one is going to buy a new switch for that. It's just plain stupid and ruins fun for so many people.","Nintendo never hid the fact it was one island per Switch. Please cry more. The true fans are too busy enjoying themselves to give a damn.","Bought to play with my girlfriend, never gotta happen i guess - one island per console.","Review bombing a game doing well is not cool and I hope metacritic staff do something about this.","IGN's Review:\r *Animal Crossing is a SOCIAL Simulation Video Game.*\r*Multiplayer: \"THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO, Than get in each others way.\"*\r*IGN Verdict: 9 ...

There has always only ever been one town per cartridge.

This game wasn't made for a marathon. It's a simulation game, it's kind of a mix between the best of Minecraft and the best of The Sims.\r Yes, there is the problem of only one island per console, but honestly, I would buy one switch for every user just to play.","I am giving this game a 8/10, although the game would be a 9/10 for me personally. As you all already know by now the one island per console limitation is VERY stupid. In order to progress in the game you need to person who owns the island to do it, making the other people playing very limited. The game itself is amazing, but the one island per console limitation makes this game not near as great as if you are playing solo. Personally i would rate it this way if you are playing solo: 9/10, and if you are playing with multiple people the experience is not near as great, and i would personally say the game is a 6/10 while playing with multiple people. This could have been pretty easily avoided if Nintendo just allowed people to have more than one island per console. Overall the game is a must buy if you plan on playing solo, but if you are playing with multiple people the game is not near as great.","1 island per console is terrible. While the game is good i cant play it for that very reason.","I knew this would happen, nintendo switch and the game developers arnt trusted anymore. They ruined mario party. Only one person can play on ONE console","A phenomenal game by Nintendo. It looks amazing and is one of the most relaxing games on the market. Everything you do is just so enjoyable.Which is really sad because Nintendo have seriously f***Ed up the multiplayer and save system. If you want the full animal crossing experience, you need to be the island representative. If you're not the island representative then tough luck, you're gonna get a pretty bad animal crossing experience since only the representative can progress the story and gain new features. It honestly sucks. Also one island per switch is a concept which should be opt in or out and having one island per switch just makes the representative problem even worse.This honestly just feels like Nintendo being greedy. Only one person per switch can have the full animal crossing experience and if you want to have it as well, buy another switch and if you want to play together.... Buy another copy of the game which is a massive investment and one made out of pure greed.Seriously, not a 0 out of 10 game but these issues are just too much and Nintendo needs to hear this loud and clear.","Not perfect but deeper than expected and super fun! Crafting feels super nice and things I thought I'll miss... I guess I didn't!","It is absurd that you cannot have another Switch user to have its own island. Yeah, you saw right. Every user on the same Switch shares the same island. That really, really, really sucks and it alone made this rating. Hope Nintendo hears us and changes this in a near future.","I bought this for my two kids! How the hell do you pick witch one is the citizen representative without causing an argument between them. What a low life move by Nintendo, You should be ashamed of yourself.","I understand what a lot of people are saying regarding the inability to make more than one Island on a console. But for me I'm the only one using my console and there is no doubt that this game is a 10 for me. It's absolutely gorgeous. There's so many things to do. And it's so relaxing. The interesting thing is that Nintendo said many moons ago that this game was only going to have one Island per console. This news is not new.","Flawless in so many ways. Do yourself a favour and don't pay attention to petty review-bombers.","As always this is a chill game. Lol to those negative comments. This must be your first ac game. Next time don't get hype without researching the game.","If you want to share your new game with someone else in your household you have to buy another switch, and this particular moment due to horrible pandemic we are all going through a new switch can set you back upwards of \u00a3500.","Amazing game, great way to relax and spend time enjoying the mundane. A classic that improves with every new iteration.","As close to perfection this crafting/chilling type of game gets. Tiniest grievances aside (eg. lack of more content, repetitive villager dialogue) this is ace fun for the family\u2014we\u2019re 4 kids and two parents deep into it and everyone loves it unequivocally... the review bombing is unwarranted.\r Another stellar AAA title from Nintendo.","The game itself is ok. It is good animal crossing experience. But it is a game entire family wants to play and with save limitation nobody can play it because if one plays it he/she is showing middle finger to all the other family members. Game leads to fights between kids and disappointment among gamer adults. I am so down right now!","Well done Nintendo on such a greedy money-grabbing technique to force people to buy multiple devices/copies of the game in order to play within the same family. With current events, do you think people are made of money? Unbelievable!","This game is extremely frustrating for two players. I would\u2019ve bought another game but not another switch. It needs to be patched or else there is no enjoyment to be had.","This is absolutly mediocre game. this game should not exist is so gargabe with awful gameplay and literraly no sense game! nintendo stop reskinning bad games...","Great game, love how I can interact with all the characters and the fishing I love it so much","Amazing game! there is no rush in playing at all, there are many things to do, by yourself and with friends. It\u2019s a game that can be played at times when you have nothing else to do and just sit down and catch some fish.The game never makes you feel like you need to play or need to stop playing, it helps you to not be bored.","Objective improvement over all previous entries with many features fans have long been asking for.","Bought the game to play with my wife. First video game she's ever been stoked to play (she's pretty new to video games). I understand people's complaints about one island per Switch console and only the first player to register being in full control, but I've actually really liked it. It allows us to better work together on our objectives and communicate what we want to do. The ease of swapping who is the leader in less than 5 seconds makes it extremely easy to work together on many tasks and split resources evenly. Sure, improvements could be made on the system, but considering how incredible the rest of the game is, it's a minor inconvenience for us. Note that this is my own personal opinion and other people may strongly disagree, but I for one, absolutely love the game, and so does my wife!","New Horizons is a refreshing take on the animal crossing series of games. It has new elements to keep animal crossing veterans happy, and it is simple enough for new players to enjoy.","Soo much fun!! People arent rating the game fairly at all. Bombing a great game for one piece you don't like is childish. In a time where there isn't much to bring the mood up Animal Crossing is the best.","One of the best games i\u2019ve ever played, it\u2019s so relaxing and because of being home full-time it\u2019s extremely comforting being able to sit and play with all of my friends","This is a very fun game if you are playing single player. Multi-player definitely has its flaws and only being able to have one island per console kind of sucks. Personally I don't find it that much of a problem myself since I'm the only one playing the game and I don't have access to internet. There is a few minor things I would have changed but all in all a solid game. Be vigilant and do your research before you buy a game, unlike the people review bombing this game","I've played around 9 hours out of the past 24. Absolutely brilliant addition to the AC series. Gorgeous graphics, and that serene gameplay feel I've come to expect from AC games.","Waiting for new animal crossing for so long and this is exactly what I was waiting for.","This Is defintely the evolution that we the fans and the saga deserve and a ver y good entrance forma news to the world of Animal crossing.","Incre\u00edble juego, siento de horas para jugar, y esta las posibilidades no tienen l\u00edmites","Literally and unabashedly the greatest game I have ever played in my life. I have always been a fan of Animal Crossing, and this is by and far the greatest in the series. Over a dozen of my friends and I play together, and every single day we're so excited to see what will happen, what will change, what will unlock, etc. Cannot praise this game enough.","It\u2019s basically new leaf but better in any way possible and local multiplayer is fun!! if only i can give an 11/10 i totally recommend this fire of a game","An amazing addition to the animal crossing games. Beautiful graphics, cute characters, fishing and hunting bugs are very enjoyable. People complaining about the multiplayer and giving reviews of 0 are being arrogant and ignoring all other good aspects of the game","Great game, far exceeded my expectations. A little disappointed with a few of the mechanics until I realized I was just using them wrong. Beautiful, calm, stress free. Favorite game of 2020 by far","Well i have 2 switch and me and my wife are playing on both accounts, pepople is hating too much, scoring 0 for something that can be better but not checking all the cool features the game has. Grow up.","Great expansion on a beloved series. Highly recommend to anyone who might like a game like this.","For all you cry babies Nintendo said ahead of release ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH! STOP your dang crying! The game is awesome. It is poop about the access that the second player in the island gets. But if you have played the other animal crossing games you don't share your town/island it never works out. And for the people time travelling complaining of lack of content my goodness take the time and enjoy the game stop trying to get everything all at once. I'm pretty sure Nintendo said there would be events happening in real life time so why skip ahead and complain","It's a great game! Finally after trying for a year, my boyfriend is heavily interested in the same game as me. As to those who complain about singular islands, the knowlege was made public months prior to release, that's your own fault. I love the formatting and the graphics, so beautiful and detailed! And certain audio files that were once piercing and screechy in previous games have been softened to a much more soothing tone. I can have someone sleeping in the same room as me with the volume up and this game will not disturb their sleep! Seriously, but this game. You can handle taking turns, it's the exact same way it was with the DS games.","People complaining about multiplayer simply have no idea how Animal Crossing works, or how it has ALWAYS worked. If you share a switch with someone, but cannot fathom sharing an island, then just find a different game to play. From everyone I've talked to, it's clear: people who love Animal Crossing love this game.","Game is awesome. Everyone downvoting is mad about a multiplayer issue with people living on the same island being gated  by the first player being the only one able to progress certain things forward. Sucks but no reason to review bomb a game. It\u2019s been out 4 days...   Remake your island and out a first player that will progress the island instead of make everyone wait? Time skip a couple days if you need to catch back up.","This is the game I go to when i want to relax. I enjoyed the previous games in the series and love the new additions to the game. This is a game you need to be willing to play year round but casually to enjoy the seasonal changes and new fauna. The open sandbox lay out let's you not feel rushed and enjoy your time making your village.","I absolutely love this game, from the anouncement to the releace of the game. I have sunk many hours into this game making me always come back for more. The daily tasks that nook miles + brings makes it all worth the while.","I have pretty neutral feelings about the game it looks amazing and definitely feels like an animal crossing game but im really disappointed with how poorly designed the multiplayer system was i have tried to play with my brother and only the leader can actually do things player 2 can't even get an axe plus you have to share an island with everyone on that one switch it really seems like Nintendo is trying to get everyone in the household to own a switch I dont think that's fair to do especially as it was advertised very weirdly and basically no one knew what they were trying to say. My second issue is the fact that you have to buy the Nintendo online service to invite people on other switches to your island and to use the QR code clothing system i know it's not a main part of the game and you can still go through the game without it but im just disappointed in Nintendo for even putting a paywall behind online interactions.","Good game if it on your own personal switch but if you share it with anyone that also wants to play the game it's not. You have to share the same island but that's nothing new the big thing is that if you wanted to progress through the game to unlock stuff you have to be the first person to start the game otherwise you're not going to be able to. If you have a switch and more than one kid who plays it don't get them this game because it will bring nothing but trouble with it.","2 filles jumelles : l'une est en pleurs, inconsolable... Elle m'a dit plus jamais Nintendo ! Une fan pourtant inconditionnelle. N'achetez surtout pas ce jeu si vous avez 2 enfants ou plus.","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD THAT WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME. I dont even care, and even expected there to be only one island. The only issue I see with a 1 island limitation is that it is tiny with no room to expand. The big issue is that Nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game. I would say the new features and aesthetics are great , but they don't even matter when you have a game that is fundamentally broken at its very core. For example, I am the second player to start the game and decided to help player 1 with getting furniture for new houses. I  didnt get any DIY recipes for the items needed, and when I went to check the boxes for what was needed to create houses, there was zero info. Tom Nook just told me to talk to player 1. What is wrong with the developers to make a decision to encourage collaboration, but  only allow 1 player to have the resources to contribute?I love Animal Crosssing games and have played from Gamecube to DS to Wii. This game was clearly designed to push families to purchase multiple Switch Lites, and gives the middle finger for anyone that wants to fully experience a flagship game on their flagship console. There is even a great irony and an, \"F you,\"  when  they actually give you a Switch console furniture piece for  you starting  your life on the island.Congratulations Nintendo, You have successfully ruined  a beloved title. I wont review bomb and rate this at zero because everything else seems like it is good...for player 1. Otherwise, I will think twice about buying a game with Nintendo's seal of approval.","I really love the game! But being the second player suck so bad! You cant participate in the story and miss a ton of diy recipe. It just kill my experience!","I literally spent the first two days trying to figure out why I was not able to progress in the game only to find out that's because my wife started the game first, so I basically can't access 100% of the game right now. That's a very lame way to make people buy a brand-new console just for one game. The Switch is supposed to be a familial console and this came is not.","Overall is a fun game but Nintendo needs to change their user treatment. Now if you or your girlfriend or brother want to play the game YOU PAID FULL PRICE, you need to buy a new Nintendo switch. Not just a new game but a new game and a new Nintendo switch. That makes no sense and seems like they are making fun of us as users.","This game deserves 9/10 but gets 0 at this time.\r I cannot be that only one island is possible for each switch and not for each account on the switch. Especially living in a shared flat with friends. :S","Pas la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er plusieurs \u00eeles et injouable pour le deuxi\u00e8me joueur de la console","This is a fantastic game....if you\u2019re the first one on it. If you unlucky enough to be the second one, and can\u2019t shell out the money to buy a whole new switch and game, then your stuck being just a visitor with a house. You have no control over what happens on the island apart from being able to decorate your house and pick up weeds. Being one island per console is bad but essentially one player per console is terrible. I\u2019ve been a fan of animal crossing for so long and loved everyone of them but if they had told us of these limitations before release I would not have bought it.","Bought this with the intention to have 3 people play on my Switch, just to find out we can't start out own campaigns or do things the first player does.  The feature to save your own campaign on a console has been around for 20 years, and is solely a money-grabbing technique to make us buy another switch.  Hugely disappointed as I thought Nintendo was above this kind of scheme.","One island per switch its so sad to play, it should've been limited to 3 islands per console at least or something like that so most members of a family can enjoy the game properly. Not everybody can buy more than one switch.","Multiplayer sucks. It is so bad to not be able to play with another player on one switch, this makes me so mad and sad at the same time","Only one island per switch. Even if you have another copy of the game. The saved file remains on the switch. I can appreciate developers incorporating new ideas to get people to play together, but such things shouldnt be forced upon the player.","It is abused !  A single island per console means practically only one user while there were 4 of us including my 3 kids wanting to play it on our different profiles, I\u2019m disgusted by this Game and Nintendo.","cant even have my own island as another member of my household has already started playing! ridiculous! we don\u2019t have the money to buy a new nintendo switch! fix your game!!!","Animal Crossing: New Horizons only allows one save file per switch; anyone who shares a switch will not be able to play the game. Very disappointing. Text and cutscenes also need to be skippable.","Absolutely love this game! Have been addicted as soon as it was available to play in my region! I don't have any issues with the complaints about multiplayer limitations. My partner and I have been having a wonderful time collaborating and building our island together, it's been a really nice bonding moment actually. I especially love how they made changing the leader character so seamless by just shaking the joycon/controller.","Absolutely love this addition to the Animal Crossing series. Can't put my controller down for long without wanting to hop back on!","Great game overall, but the lack of multiple islands is a bit disappointing. I'm not affected by this, but I can see why others are.","Amazing game to have right now. I'm only three days in but I can see this as a game I will be playing off and on for at least a year.","They absolutely blew my expectations out of this world, I could have not asked for a more perfect game. There are plenty of things to look forward too as well and am highly anticipating the many years I'm going to put into this beauty.","Folks seem to think that a mild inconvenience is worth giving a game a rating of 0. If the game does not run, or damages your hardware, or if it is literally unplayable, then that deserves a 0. It's a gorgeous game that makes me happy, it's probably one of the strongest titles in the series. Folks giving this game a 0 are one of the reasons we can't have nice things","The game handles progressing so well. I absolutely love it, the only thing I'd change is having more than one person on multiplayer per switch. Besides that i love how cute it is, making new friends and playing it with my family.","What an amazing  game super fun to play I grew up with Nintendo but i have never played animal crossing and wow i have been missing out. It's fun to play theres tons of things to do and kill time especially with the corona virus going on right now. But i have to give this game a 5 and that reason being is that well to start off i got this game for my wife she loves animal crossing. We were excited to play until we found out we couldn't have two islands you would need to purchase a separate switch to have two island's what a bummer :( and you're limited on the second player i hope they listen to the gamer base and change this because we are not happy. Please fix this! I'd give this a ten but the lack of another island baffles me.","Calming but fun. Very enjoyable for someone who plays many different types of games and was looking for something easy-going to play for about an hour each day. I did have to get used to playing in real-time, but its all good now","Game doesn\u2019t let you keep multiple islands. It\u2019s only one island PER SWITCH. If you have two people sharing a console don\u2019t plan on both of them playing this. Can\u2019t even buy two copies, nope, one island per switch. Horrible way to do it","Local multiplayer is completely broken; one island per console and the first player is the only one that can actually progress the game (and gets free things that the others have to pay for). Woe betide the household that lets their young child play first, as they will not be inclined to work to keep the game moving for everybody else and you'll all be stuck in the doldrums forever.","Bought this game mostly because my girlfriend wanted it and because it claims to have local co-op. It seemed like a perfect game for us to share and play together. I ended up getting really into it until I realized how big of a problem sharing one island is and not being able to have separate save files. This MAJOR flaw essentially makes this purchase a complete waste of money. If you are going to play by yourself, it is worth it but if you are planning to share this game with anyone in your house dont even bother. It is a complete waste of money and a terribly flawed game...unless of course you plan on buying another switch to share the game with someone.","Fun game. It is shameful that they have bricked up the AC experience just because they wouldn\u2019t want you sharing TOO much of the game. No no, make your family buy individual switches so they can have any fun at all. I hope they fix this or it comes back to bite them, they don\u2019t deserve the support they\u2019ve received.","animal crossing new leaf was way better, the new breaking tool system sucks... the extra wait for game was not worth it 0/10","fiquei bem chateado de nao poder criar 2 ilhas diferentes no AC mas oque me deixou mais p da vida ainda \u00e9 o fato de que s\u00f3 o criador da ilha que tem progressao no jogo o resto que quiser jogar  tbm, tem q ser refem disso...\rpor favor nintendo arruma isso","I love sharing a game with family members, only to find out the first person to play the game is the only person who actually gets to experience the game fully. There is literally no point in me playing this game unless I want to walk around shaking trees and building fishing rods, while the first person to play the game actually gets to enjoy what I can only assume is a good game. I only played the game for an hour and I want that hour of my life back, thanks Nintendo.","When my partner first told me about Animal Crossing, I was kind of excited. I\u2019m from a tropical region and, while I hadn\u2019t played it as a kid, I had played Harvest Moon, and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass COVID-19 quarantine. The reality was not cute. My boyfriend didn\u2019t think I wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and stripped  it of all resources. I had no idea how ACNH worked so I started a save file thinking I would either get my own island or have different resources generated for my file, or like anything a reasonable designer would think of, right?Instead of starting with a tutorial explaining what choices would be permanent and unchangable, I got a message that just told me to put my tent down. Noticing all the trees were bare, I confusedly put my tent close to my bf\u2019s and tried to figure out what to do.  After running around breaking my flimsy tools for two hours trying to get wood and stone that wouldn\u2019t spawn, I looked up what was happening. Not only was there no way to respawn resources other players had hoarded, accidentally or not, as the non \u201crepresentative resident\u201d I couldn\u2019t donate to the museum until it was complete and I could not build the store nor decide where it was placed. I also learned that expanding our houses was impossible if they were too close, which seems like vital clarifying information in a game aimed at children.We tried playing for a few days but even though we were communicating it was not working out. We play video games very differently. I am impatient. My partner doesn\u2019t like to put much thought into games or rush. I found out that I could time surf but my partner doesn\u2019t want to do that since he is, apparently, \u201can animal crossing purist\u201d or rather he doesn\u2019t want the villagers to be \u201cmad at him for cheating.\u201dFor those who are reading and saying \u201cso what you\u2019re just not trying to cooperate\u201d we really are and ACNH doesn\u2019t really provide anything to help with that! There\u2019s no shared inventory pool so multiple players can easily contribute to helping build up the town.In order to send resources to other accounts on the same system you have to either mail them per item for 200 bells each (time consuming and not cheap x 12 items per day). Not exactly helpful. So after two days I had switched to hitting Nook miles achievements and using all my miles for nook tickets so I could actually like, get anywhere in the game without stripping the island of resources he needs to build the town. My partner was surprised I payed off my home loan before him. I told him I was using the Nook tickets like a revolving door to rack up achievements and resources. He said he had not used a ticket yet and had just bought hair styles. He was embarrassed to tell me this.  I realized I was making him feel bad about his playing style just by him having to watch how I play. I normal speed through games faster than he does but he never has to play the same file I do until ACNH. We had thought this would be a fun bonding activity while we were locked in but it wound up being stressful and anxiety inducing.The feeling we had fostered around the game was not one of shared joy and reassurance, but unease and mutual resentment, I resented that I could not run the island and build the town and my boyfriend resented seeing the rushed way I was playing since it took the relaxing element of playing away from him. So yesterday, I emptied my inventory out on the ground and deleted my Animal Crossing file. We have pretty good communication and lots of other games I enjoy so while upset, I\u2019m know my ACNH experience isn\u2019t as bad as it could be. I know if I was a kid ,who are the ~main group~ this game was made for, who had to share this with a sibling while in quarantine I would be crying. Even if we bought a second cartridge we can only have one island per switch system.Half the world is unemployed for at least a month, does Nintendo really expect people to buy second and third switch systems to play one game fairly?TLDR: I rate this game 0/10 for worsening an already traumatic experience of being trapped in my house with no control over the world, and making my partner and I feel bad for just wanting to play a game differently. Bad user experience design for no easy item sharing while demanding people share an island. This was frustrating as adults with good impulse control, I cannot imagine how infuriating it is for the target audience of children and teens.","This game is great for one player. As dozens of other reviews say, the problem starts when you have multiple people in the house. My girlfriend was just as excited to try this game as I was when we got it, so you can imagine the disappointment for both of us when we discovered how there can only be one island. As player 1, I spend most of my gameplay feeling guilty and feeling bad about making decisions that she\u2019s not allowed to participate in or trying to balance between wanting to do everything but not wanting to take all the resources from her. As player 2, she spends the gameplay basically just being a visitor to the island, never able to make any actual changes or shape the island how she really wants. She\u2019s also locked out of many little tasks (such as helping Gulliver). This simple mechanic that would be easy to fix in an update has truly ruined the experience for both of us. The fact that Nintendo is trying to use this as an opportunity to sell more switches is absolutely absurd and it\u2019s honestly really disappointing. It turned what should have been a happy and fun experience for us both into a really disappointing one all in the name of corporate greed. Shame on Nintendo.","I bought this game and my husband unlocked pretty much everything already. Now I wanna play but it only allows one island per person. Even if I buy another copy of the game it would not let me have another save.","Gameplay is determined by the first login.  They pick the island and all other users exist on their island and have a completely frustrating game play experience.  Save your money.","I made an account just to review this game. Because of my disappointment\r I am a solo player who was entering this franchise for the first time. So the single island per console thing doesn't effect me, but in an era where other games can have as many procedural generated worlds as people can fit on their console hard drive...that makes absolutely no sense. And these islands are tiny.\r My first impression of this game is that it forces you to play it how IT wants you to. I have repeatedly changed my in game clock on my switch just so I can progress the game, and when you consider that you can hit the first time gate in 40 minutes, it puts you in an awkward position where your first day of the game is just shaking tree's and catching bugs and fish while trapped in the starting area. I felt like I was playing an early access title.\r What's worse is you are punished for your progression initially. You get locked out of content because the game decides you've done enough of it and then doesn't let you back into that system for 48 real world hours. At one stage you are not allowed to buy key items used in repeatable achievements because you are playing the game at the wrong REAL WORLD time. And this makes no sense when you consider the first version of the shop is available 24-7.\r The control mapping is bizarre, the tool system, which is arguably the most important system in the game is bound to the D-pad instead of the back buttons, which is annoying when you consider that fast moving insects exist in this game and you have to stop moving to swap to your net. Also the phone being bound to ZL instead of + symbol makes no sense..The + symbol is only used to access a specific menu in the phone...The central buttons on a controllers are universally used for key menus in most modern games so why was this an exception?\r To further add to the clunky issues with the game, the shop system puts filler dialog in everything, and only allows you to buy items in 1's or 5's, while some repeatable achievements require 3 of the item, so you either buy 5 to save time, or buy 3 increments of 1 just to save money. I don't know if future upgrades to the island make this simpler, but if that's the case, why on earth would game designs make players have to unlock intuitive design?\r If not for the returns policy of the retailer I bought this at, I would already have returned it. I will continue to play my $69AUD investment to the endgame and may change my review depending on how the mid-late game is.","Looks cool, my husband has a great time playing, but unfortunately, they only allow 1 island save PER SWITCH. So I will never know what it's like to play how I want to. Got super excited to start and was dropped on to his already populated island. A real let down. Shame in you Nintendo, you know this is a greedy tactic.","This game is marketed as being multiplayer friendly, and an experience all can enjoy and share together. It is not designed as such. Unless you are a single person, or are the ONLY person playing on the Nintendo Switch you download/install this game on, this game is currently in a criminally unplayable state. Currently, whichever Switch user account launches Animal Crossing first, is the ONLY account that gets the full retail game experience. All subsequent accounts have to play a miserable shadow of the game the customer paid for.\r This design oversight is so heinous, it's causing many people, including myself, to wonder if this is actually a ploy by Nintendo to get people to buy more Switch/Switch Lite consoles. As a life long fan of the company it would be pretty devastating to watch them go the way of EA, Zenimax, and so many other fallen titans in the industry.\r Extended Review:\rThe whole world is on lockdown right now, and a fun, relaxing, life sim type game such as this sounded like a great way for my wife and I to enjoy some decompression time together. Not the case. I spent $60 dollars on the Nintendo store only to find that we had to share one island (not a problem) but that only ONE of the profiles on the switch was able to progress the story, and advance our island's progress.\r My wife was the first to launch the game. I made my character and started building my only little house on the island a few hours after she had some time with the game. Fast forward 3 days, and now I find that I cannot help settle new villagers, I cannot be given tasks by varying NPCs, I cannot contribute/have a say to the layout of new buildings and terraforming on the island, and a result, I've paid $60 for the pleasure of farming materials to trade to my wife's account for use as she deems fit.\r This is a wholly unacceptable state of the game and legitimately needs to be patched. I will be following up with my credit card provider tethered to my Nintendo Online account (bought the game on Switch store) and asking for refunds on the same basis that hundreds of thousands of Fallout 76 players got their refunds for: consumer ethics breach.\r Nowhere in any advertising or marketing material was I given the impression that only one person in my household would be able to fully play the game. I'm not talking about a subjective \"enjoyment\" of the game...I am referencing the clear and simple fact that only one account per Switch has access to the entirety of the game that was sold for $60 USD. Secondary, tertiary, and all subsequent accounts will have a miserable, gated experience and have 0 agency over the ONLY island the entirety of the household is allotted.\r Without a clear disclaimer being present prior to purchase, this is unethical and either needs to be patched or customers need to be refunded. Until either happens, this is a 0/10, awful, regrettable purchase for anyone not living/playing alone on their Switch.","It is such a shame that you don't get an island per account. I mean, we get along fine, and our first reaction was that it was a shame not to be able to fill each our museum, or to just fully control our characters when we both play at the same time.\rNot having two islands unless you buy two consoles is greedy and is a big let down!","Horrible decisions for multiple players. I bought this game because it's the only thing my wife will play. I let her play first and now, as soon as she gets bored of it, the game will stop progressing.  I can't restart the island because I want her to have the \"player 1 experience\" in the only game she has ever shown interest in.  This would be fine for a 20-30 dollar title. But for a full 60 it is unacceptable.\r It completely overshadows any charm this game has.  And all the people saying \"its fine\" are people that aren't affected by the issue. I feel as if I was sold an experience tthat was not advertised as what it really is.  It is a single player game.  Players 2-8 might as welll be NPCs.  Nintendo laid an egg.  But it could definitely be fixed.  But I wouldn't count on it.","Fantastic game. Daily grind is super addicting and the game is as charming as can be. Love this game","I'm not sure if this is pure Nintendo-style incompetence or unethical, malicious, money-hungry nastiness.  I prefer the latter because I can't imagine Nintendo is this inept  Here are the main issues which this otherwise great game which drag it down to the depths of cynical, corporate garbage.\r 1.  One island per switch?  What?  Completely and utterly destroys any hopes of playing with others.  If you're in a household with multiple people who want to play this GAME, think TWICE before buying.  This will create problems and essentially force you to both buy a second switch (or more) if you want to have the experience.  What are parents supposed to do with multiple kids who want to play?  Nintendo's plan all along was to have multiple switches per household, and they are trying to implement it in the most disgusting way, with artificially installed limitations.  There is NO technical limitation there can't be more than than one island per switch.\r 2 - Is there a way around it through coop?  NO.  Local coop is bare bones, pathetic, and an embarassment.  You have zero agency as the second partner, basically just following along like an idiot.  You cannot progress in any meaningful way.  So no, this is not an option for multiple people to enjoy this game.\r 3 - Online multiplayer.  Don't get me started.  I've never seen such a poorly implemented online from Nintendo.  This is WORSE THAN SMASH.  And that's saying a lot.  Firstly, you have to go to the airport, wade through seas of text, including the bird actually \"connecting to the internet.\"  Is this dial up?  Then when you finally get to of a friend's island, and someone else wants to join, you will have to sit through a green message popping up forcing you to quit your menu, a FIVE STAGE flight screen for the plane to arrive (God knows why this is necessary, what is it loading??), a save screen, and a cutscene of the person walking in the airport.  This happens EVERY TIME someone joints the island, and breaks up anything you're doing multiple times.  Absolute lunacy.  Again, not sure if this is incompetence or purposeful - Nintendo is known to hate online.  This is their way of saying - Online is unplayable, don't do it, just buy more switches and play locally.  Also, why are there no mini-games to play with friends like New Leaf?  There is nothing to do with multiplayer online and things get boring fast.  Would minigames have been so difficult to implement?\r 4- No cloud saves at launch.  Apparently something is being \"worked on\".  Why not at launch?  Is it so hard?  Are they so concerned about cheating?  People are time travelling like crazy as we speak.  They could have easily imposed some limitation like one cloud save per day.  This is just mean, honestly.  Pure meanness.  Creates unnecessary added stress about losing your save.  Apparently a download will be allowed once, but who knows if this is true.  Why??!\r These are just some of many issues.  What is Nintendo thinking?  They've been working on this since 2012!!!\r Don't expect a patch.  Like Mario Part, Smash, etc. there has never been a patch that improves the fundamental problems of the game.\r Single player is good but I have to give 0/10 for this because it can't be comprehended other than through a lens of cynical exploitation.","Well,  now I have to spend extra $400  to not ruin my little sister progress. Oh wait I lost my job, nice.","My 11 year old daughter was the first to play.  Little did I realize that she would therefore be the owner of the island.  She got to name it and no one can change anything about it.  Nor can anyone else in the household have the same gameplay experience because you can only have one island per switch console.  I\u2019m was really looking forward to playing.  Now I\u2019m disappointed and upset that I wasted the money buying this game.","I cannot believe Nintendo has people spending $60 on this game and not giving it more than 1 save file. People use this as a home console and many families will be restricted because of the save files as well as the fact that player 1 gets to choose everything.","I will give the game a good note when Nintendo decides to let me play, as i am the second player and my sister left the game I literally can't play the game if i don't waste like 20 hours of gameplay, this game sucks and won't stop sucking unless nintendo patches the game and let you change the Resident Representative","The one island per console has caused me to hate the game. I have no control over my girlfriend's island. What she says goes and I rarely to never get to pick villagers because she wants the perfect island. It has ruined my fun and I don't even want to play the damn game now. It's not review bombing if this is literally the way I feel. 'But they said it was one island in an article' Good for them. I don't read articles constantly.","Made this account just to say the Nintendo overloads are greedy demons. Forcing players to buy another $300 SWITCH, just to share the game with loved ones is fking criminal. I highly advise NOT buying the game if you live with anyone else who's excited to play it.","I actually think this game is really amazing, addictive and all that jazz, but I can\u2019t get behind the \u201cone island per switch\u201d and every player past player 1 is useless and can\u2019t do anything to help the island or have fun in general. It\u2019s just Nintendo\u2019s way of making people pay for another game and switch. It\u2019s abysmal!","Animal crossing new horizons is a great game anyone can enjoy. My only nitpick is that it starts off slow and is really best played with one person on the island, other than that, there is not much else bad about it. Solid 9/10","The game looked amazing when I first heard about it. I've always loved Animal Crossing games. But this one not so much. I hate it because the first one to start up the game becomes the \"Resident Representative\" and gets to choose the island, name it, build houses for the residents, do tasks which lead to the construction of a museum and the construction of a shop, and other various tasks. Everyone who starts the game after the \"Resident Representative\" is put into the same island and is unable to do any similar tasks. As someone who isn't the Resident Representative I have to say it makes it hard to stay interested. My brother who is the Representative, always gets tasks to do while the only interesting thing I can do is pay off a loan or maybe build furniture. I have to deal with whatever he chooses to do because I have no other choice. It doesn't give me as much freedom as I expected. The game is supposed to be about how you build your own island and not about favouring someone over others. It forces the others to live on an island which is controlled by someone else. Basically, the game ignores what it is supposed to be about.I'm really disappointed in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The developers have made a great game but it has a major flaw which makes the game hard for me to enjoy. $80 spent just to be let down. Thanks Nintendo. You could've done better.","The one island/one user per switch makes no sense! When the switch was designed to be a multi user platform.","Bought the game and unfortunately let my brother start the game FIRST, then realized that I became a glorified visitor instead of a game owner at this point, the single console single save file approach is one of if not the MOST anti-consumer move that I have seen recently, this literally made me so sour that my sentiment of  towards the game went from hopeful and excited into rotten sour, literally bought the game but can't play the game, this is the very first \"have not started the game but already gotten hurt by the game\", does not feel good at all, very conflicted right now.","The game is good. I bought it for my and my daughters. The moment I found out that only one of my daughters who happened to arrive first in Atlantis can get the receipt for the flimsy axe and do many other things, that neither me or my other daughter could do, I couldn't believe it. Then I have to find out that this is a feature - not a bug. This is simply unacceptable. All others not arriving first are just sitting in the back seat and can work as slaves. At least the receipts then should be shared. What is point for the other to have their own house if they can't produce anything and are dependent on tools they also can't create?","As a new Nintendo Player and Animal Crossing player. This 1 player progression fundamentally kills the experience without any forewarning to let you know. Waste of many that will be getting refunded, never again Nintendo.","One Island for one console. It\u2019s a disgrace for a game and a company who want to provide a multisocial gaming experience.","Do Not Allow Young Children to Play First!  I made the mistake of buying this game for myself but allowing my 6 year old to start the game.  He started the island (with a misspelled non-punctuated name) and got everything going.  No major issues there!  I\u2019m now player 2 but I\u2019m held by the short and curlies by my sons progress.  He played a few hours the first day but that\u2019s all his attention can take.  I\u2019ve been playing for three days and I still don\u2019t have a shovel because he hasn\u2019t progressed yet.  This is a major issue.\r Honestly, the game is cute and a lot of fun.  I just hate that I\u2019m unable to do anything because all progress is locked to the first player.  I don\u2019t mind sharing an island, I think that\u2019s kind of fun that we can share decorating and supplies but I\u2019m the bigger gamer and I would play this game more if I could do anything other than fish and catch bugs.  So, I can\u2019t give it a good grade.","Extremely disappointed in Nintendos decision to only allow 1 island per console. Its just a greedy money grabbing tactic that completely ruined the\"family friendly\" aspect of the game. I was so looking forward to this release but now I am totally turned off. I don't usually leave reviews, but Nintendo needs to see that they can't keep exploiting their customers. I sincerely hope they release a patch for this because as of now, I'm no longer particularly interested in supporting their company until they do. Which is unlikely.","it\u2019s a great way to pass the time of being at the house all day! You get to make your own little Island and make new friends along the way. It has great music to listen to and many things to complete like the museum where you need to collect all the bugs, fossils, and fish you can to help complete it. Sure it might take a day for some items or villagers to arrive, but it is worth it at the end where you see your completed island.","The one island policy is disrespectful from a company who is built upon making family content. This isn't a huge problem for me, I live with my gf. However the fact that only one of us can make progress is terrible and whoever we decide gets to do so will feel terrible. This is blatant greed from Nintendo's part. It's like they arent even trying to hide it. I was so excited now I'm just sad.I made an account just to post this, and I will come back and give it a better score if fixed.","Great, except for the fact that you can only have one island per system, which almost completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch","I was excited about this game until I found out the 1 island per console limitation. Really need to fix this. I watched my girlfriend play for hours and was excited to start my own island and adventure, then find out that I'm stuck on hers. Not fun for houses with multiple players, and should be an easy fix regarding save files setup.","Great if you're the only person playing on your system. Every additional player is a glorified NPC who misses out on the entire progression of the game. Can't even buy multiple game copies for one switch to mitigate the issue. Some serious BS crippling what is otherwise a phenomenal game.","Dear Nintendo, my kids and I was waiting the game more than a year, and what for? Separate islands and separate saves for each USER - this is so basic and obvious requirement, I just can't understand, why you did it this way???","Great game. People need to quit being children and review bombing it. Its completely ridiculous to review bomb something over a 1 island per profile limit it doesnt mean they wont add more....","trash game made by greedy company, what else is there to say. will never get because of one island per console","Graphics look amazing from the jump from New Leaf to new horizons. The one island per switch does kinda suck, but that's not really a huge concern for me  because I have fun sharing an island with my family, also if it can be fixed with an update then I dont think it should be counted against, that's just my opinion.","This game is AMAZING! The review bombing on this website is truly toxic. Yes it's not optimal to play with multiple players on one switch, but this was already mentioned before release. It's not a reason to give it a 0/10. I have been playing daily since March 18th and I can say that this is one of the most fun and relaxing games I've played in a long time. There is so much to do, but all in your own pace. Want to play 20 mins a day? Go ahead! Or binge it the entire evening farming materials and crafting furniture for your cozy little house? It's up to you! Normally I'm into action games and shooters but so far I'm really enjoying this game and I can't wait to see what April has in store for us. 10/10","My first Animal Crossing game and I'm absolutely in love with it. It's the perfect game to play in the current situation. There are tons of furniture, decorative and clothing options that all look beautiful. You can create your own designs and share them with everyone. You can even use old designs from New Leaf. The best part is the museum. Tons of fish and insects are available to be collected and donated to the museum. It's incredibly fun to meet up with friends and tour each others collections. You can even dig up fossils and donate them to be able to see huge skeletons of dinosaurs.","I had very high hopes for this game, and I started playing this series as a kid when wild world was released. This game has surpassed all expectations I had, and I've already put so many hours into it. It has all of the elements from the old games plus so much more.","Nintendo fix this.This is the worst time to be SO greedy. My wife and I were very excited to play our first Animal Crossing ever. Now we're probably just going to skip this one entirely.","Sure it suffers from the inability to make more than one island along with the older animal crossing tripe, but the amount of review bombs for this game is stupidly overblown. It is an incredibly enjoyable game that just has some flaws for groups of people who all want to play. Just realize that the limits of accessing others islands for the most part is just the same as a Minecraft world or Terraria game. If the owner leave you can't play on that world again. Deal with it and enjoy the great game you do already have.","So far, I have put more time into this game than I\u2019d like to admit. I really like a lot of the new things that have been added, but I feel that so much of the old content that made the game feel well rounded is missing. I am at the point where I believe I have obtained every shop/ building in the game and there\u2019s about the same amount as the GameCube game. Pros:Fantastic graphicsOnline works very wellMuseum is beautifulFishing/bug catching is still solidFossils are the same Interior design systemSending letters/presents to real life friendsVillager interactions are betterLost items aren\u2019t as annoyingCrafting system for building itemsNook miles systemCons:Only one upgrade of nook\u2019s crannyVery little to do other than fish, catch bugs, and collect resources A lot of beloved characters from older titles are completely gone. Only characters, other than villagers, are the nooks, Isabelle, blawthers, able sisters, and occasional merchantsNo clubNo garden storeNo dream loungeNo kicks(he stops by town with small inventory)No tours No post officeNo shampoodleNo coffee shopItems are very expensive for basic household things(ex:cello=100,000 bells)One island per switch(doesn\u2019t affect me)Wait times for tutorial are manyItems break all the timeCrafting takes way too long depending on the itemTedious work for resourcesNo tropical fruitNo hedges No swimming/divingNo ordinancesMoving buildings on island costs a lot of money and is not the easiest to get perfect Overall, I feel as if this game is just a hollow shell. For $60 I expected there to be more content then ever but it just feels barren. This is from someone who owns and has loved all the past games. Hopefully updates add a bunch of content, but $60 for an unfinished game is not acceptable.","My sister and I share a single switch. We bought it together because we live together and we have enjoyed our games so far. Enjoying separate save files for all of the games so far on one system. We shared breath of the wild (which has a much larger map and more detailed graphics).\u00a0 And now when we went to play we learn there is only one island per console.\u00a0 Which means if you want to play animal crossing your own way you have to buy an entire switch. This problem cant even be fixed with switching\u00a0 sd cards because the game saves directly to the switch. Does this mean that if I did buy a new switch I wouldnt be able to transfer my game save file over as well? I was planning to get a v2 eventually for the extended battery life.Now I was willing to maybe overlook that, however this game was clearly built for one player. The first player who boots up the system gets to be the island representative. This means that all of the tool advancements, craftable recipes, and any building locations are all decided by player one. This basically makes player two a glorified npc. Not only this but I learned that you cant send fish or bugs to a friend. Which is so dumb because I purposefully chose the opposite region so I could give my friends cool things they dont have yet.I had also hoped to have a great white shark in my room but the display for a shark is now a tiny pool with high walls and you can scarcely see the creature inside. I dont know why they decided to change the model to something that looks so awful.I am severely disappointed in nintendo for what they've done.Dont get me wrong the game is fun, but dont expect to play it with anyone.","I really have been enjoying the game so far, but the reason for such a low score is one simple reason. The baffling decision to make it so there\u2019s only 1 island per Switch console, because of this incompetence, my girlfriend can\u2019t make any progress in the game and now has to wait to see if Nintendo will decide to fix this (which shouldn\u2019t have been an issue in the first place)","One island per switchseriusly nintendo? In 2020? Update the game and make more islands per console!!","Game limits second person so much, playing game as second account is like being a visitor. Fix your game Nintendo.","How did anyone think it was a good idea to limit, what is essentially a kid's game, to one player per console!! This is besides the annoying terrible controls for placing items in the world. The camera angle is also really terrible for a game where you need to position structures in the world and is especially annoying when trees and structures don't go translucent when the player is behind. They use same generic leaf icon to represent multiple different items in the inventory so you have to select each one to read the text for it. Its' shocking that a game like this was released by Nintendo in 2020 when a significantly better game like Stardew Valley exists and was developed by 1 person.","Once Nintendo solves the huge one-island-per-console disaster, we\u2019ll come back to get update the scores, for sure. Huge mistake.","I was going to buy this game until I realized it is only one island per console, literally the most greedy atrocious thing I\u2019ve seen since the stuff EA has pulled in the past few years, I will not be purchasing this thing until they fix multiplayer and fix this piece of crap 1 island per switch rule.","The multiplayer design decisions are completely insane. How do you put such little thought into the fact that the Switch is a home console with multiple users. This would be such a nice game to enjoy with family / significant others, but the gameplay is utterly broken for local multiplayer.\r Allow multiple islands per switch. Allow secondary players to make progress on their own. Figure out a way to re-balance island resources for multiple players. This is absolutely infuriating.\r Nintendo literally brands the Switch as a family home console. All of their ads show multiple users on one console. HOW DO YOU MISS THIS!","Absolutely livid with this game. I'm a more serious gamer that is focused on goals and development while my partner is more of a casual gamer that likes to collect bugs and go fishing. Unfortunately they are the primary resident and I am the secondary so I am just **** out of luck. We have both put in days of work on this game so it's too late to restart and make me the primary. Just have to wait until they are completely done with the game before I can play, loved how nintendo demands I buy a second switch at hundreds of dollars if both people in my house want to play this game during the same month. If I could I would send a bag of flaming **** to every developer that helped this happen. Desperately hoping for a patch to this issue but I would bet 100 bucks nothing will happen because why would they fix a problem that means consumers have to buy more products?","there needs to be multiple islands available per player. most of the game experience is completely ruined for a second player as fundamental gameplay is only available to the starting player.","The decent but short story and many of the game's new features are locked behind Nintendo's absurd one safe file per switch rule. If you want to play this game with your family, friends, or anybody who plays on the same console as you, do NOT buy this game. If you are not the first person to play the game on a console, you become a glorified NPC that can't do anything to progress the story. Nintendo is being aggressively greedy at the expense of their players, it is absolutely ridiculous that Nintendo, a company with some of the most skilled, talented, and smart people in the video game industry made such a horrible design decision for no reason other than corporate greed.\r Though if you plan to play this game alone, it is a very good animal crossing game reminiscent of the original gamecube game with many new features and an amazing story centered around building a deserted island with nothing but a few tents into a thriving, developed community. My only complaint about the story is that I think it should be (and can be) longer. The postgame, like all animal crossing games, has tons to offer as I expected, but there are a few omissions from the other games that make the postgame feel like it's missing something. There is no coffee shop, no fortune teller, no theater no barbershop, and only two shops. While the new island customization options and some other smaller features do provide some new postgame content, I don't think they add quite enough to make up for the omissions and I can't see myself playing this game for years like I did in city folk and new leaf.\r Even with the decent gameplay and story, I can't justify giving this game any points at all because of its glaring design flaw in the one save per switch rule.","Fantastic game, really fun, HUGE PROBLEM THOUGH, at first sharing an island didn\u2019t seem so bad but the person who didn\u2019t create the island is so restricted to do anything ! You both get seperate DIY recipes the other can\u2019t use, co-op is a mess, so disappointed because I was really enjoying this game until finding this out.","Was going to he a fun game for me and my partner to play. Gated progress for just his account, no progress rewards for second profile, can't have our own islands on the same console. Not even interested anymore. Too bad he already bought it. I guess only he can enjoy it.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons- Don\u2019t buy itMy husband got me this game bcs he was trying to introduce me to the world of video gaming. I have to say- if all games are like this, count me out. Way to go Nintendo on destroying an otherwise great game!How did they ruin it?1- If you\u2019re a multiplayer household, you can only create 1 island total &amp; whoever has the misfortune of starting the game 2nd becomes a 2nd rate citizen on the 1st player\u2019s island. That means they can\u2019t do any quests, can\u2019t make any decisions, don\u2019t get the same kinds of rewards or as many... And you\u2019re limited in the progress you can make on the island to what the 1st player does  So short-sighted!Heck, 1/2 the time the \u201chot item\u201d you\u2019re supposed to sell is something the 2nd player doesn\u2019t even have the recipe for. To fix this? You have to buy a whole other Switch game console. Not just a second copy of the game, which would be ridiculous enough in 2020. A whole 2nd console.So painfully and obviously GREEDY!!!Don\u2019t buy it! 2- They purposefully didn\u2019t warn anybody abt any of this anywhere on the game description, instead lauding it as the ultimate social experience. Fun for families, friends, couples... Bullcrap!!Bcs when you\u2019re playing with someone else, the 2nd player can\u2019t collect anything. It all goes into the collection box. And if the 1st player looks at their storage kit or takes their tool ring out, it knocks out whatever action the 2nd player is trying to do.3- Talk to them in the only way that will actually speak to them. Clearly the only way that actually matters to them.Until Nintendo decides that they actually give a crap about their consumers (I\u2019m not even asking that they care more about their consumers than their bottom line bcs at this point it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not going to happen), do not support them by giving them the money they\u2019re clearly after with this disgusting decision they\u2019ve made.However, I am giving it 1 star bcs other than how limited the game feels, it is an enjoyable game and an enjoyable world. Even so, I probably won\u2019t be playing it for too much longer if Nintendo doesn\u2019t fix this. I just can\u2019t see myself enjoying these kinds of limitations for very long. And I\u2019ll continue telling people to not buy it- even when they\u2019re not asking me.","A theoretically great game, held back by Nintendo's frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its. 2020. Setting aside how completely useless shared-console multiplayer is, the online multiplayer feels more like it's teasing you about how good the game *could* have been if Nintendo had competent network engineers. To join someone's island, you must be friends on Switch, a process which for some reason still uses friend codes instead of usernames like literally any other platform on the internet. Then, you must click through around 30 seconds of dialogue to visit a player. You have to go through this pointless dialogue *every time*. But wait! To visit someone they have to \"open their gates\", which means going to an ingame location, and clicking through another 30 seconds of pointless dialogue. If you sleep, the gates will close and you have to do it all over again. Because of this, visiting another player effectively *always* requires communication through a 3rd party platform to coordinate your visit (no direct messages via your Switch account, sorry.)\rOnce you manage to exchange texts, ensure the other person has opened their gate, and go to join them, you are met with an almost minute long unskippable cutscene. This plays *EVERY TIME* you visit a friend. It locks you, and all players on the island you're joining. Once you get there, the island's owner will discover that they are now unable to place/move any of their furniture. Why? Because Nintendo has spent a solid 2 decades pretending that the internet doesn't exist, and so has no engineers on staff that can make online functionality.\r The single player experience is great, but it's not worth $60. It's a fun game, but just go play Stardew Valley, it has more polish and plays much smoother than this half assed game. It's totally unjustifiable to have a game with multiplayer this bad in 2020.","Can't do anything with shared island... Very limited for the second player.","Made an account on metacritic to join in on the zeroes in hopes for change since I can't even play my own game since my wife started an island before me and played too far into it to want to start over. So now I have to buy another switch to play my game? Gtfo. There was no warning for this","I love this game so much. Been a long time fan of the series, but unfortunately my brother made the island so I'm not allowed to enjoy over half the game's content, and even more until he progresses. Even with this restriction, I can still find enjoyment in it, but it's so hard to justify the decisions to not allow secondary players to progress the island or make their own.\rThe co-op is a perfect way to visualize how terrible this system is. The first player, the leader, is the only person allowed to interact with anything in the game. The secondary players don't even have access to their inventory. The fact that multiplayer is such an obvious afterthought on a home console Animal Crossing is ridiculous.\r This needs to be changed.","I cant understand why Nintendo decided to go this way of implementing two players on one console.\r The thing is that the second player is so strictly restricted what he can achieve .\r Me as island represantive i can donate fishes and stuff to nook my wife which came second cant do this.\rNow comes the funny part since my wife had so much fun in the game she played much more than me untill we noticed that only the represantive can do the main things so long story short we had to delete the savegame and start over with my wife as represantive since she plays more than me.","Selling this game for $60 and limiting to 1 island per console is outright robbery! How can you claim this game as a social experience when only one person has the full power? Who designed this game, a Dictator? My family has owned our Switch since launch and it\u2019s become a major part of our family time. This game has ruined that. My kids have resorted to undermining each other. They sneak off with the switch and hoard all the resources. This results in screaming, crying, and fighting. How dare you restrict this game in this way! I have never seen such blatant greed. If there are any lawyers out there interested in taking up a class action lawsuit please do! Or maybe just maybe the developers can just update the game to allow creating one island per profile so everyone can experience in full what the game has to offer.","I want to preface this by saying that I have few issues with the game itself. There are some unnecessarily repetitive mechanics that I think should be addressed, but nothing hugely out of character with the AC universe.\r But, the inability to have more than one island per save OR to back up your save to the cloud is baffling. This is an immediate issue for households playing together, and a huge issue going forward knowing how fragile Switch systems are. I purchased a new Switch Lite specifically for this game! A week in, and my joycons are broken, despite absolutely babying the console. If I purchase another console, I've lost 40+ hours of gameplay. Repairs are a no-go at this moment. I am sure there are so many others in this situation, and it's ridiculous. I don't have an unlimited budget to throw at Nintendo.\r I feel like the negative reviews are necessary for Nintendo to actually take notice and respond.","Look alright, I really hope someone at Nintendo is reading these and taking notes because one island per console isn't what destroys the experience of the game for me, no, it's the fact that player two is shackled down to player one's progress. As soon as started playing the game I realized this was a huge problem. I heard on Reddit that the second player's progress was only limited to the FIRST WEEK of gameplay and low and behold its been 8 days and I'm disappointed I still can't build bridges or inclines or, y'know, progress the story in any way shape or form. This is absolutely disgusting from a 60 dollar triple A title. I'm either forced to sit and wait for my sister to progress and make big decisions without my input, or log on to her account and progress the game and make big decisions without her input. I'm really sad about it to be honest and I hope this whole situation gets fixed somewhere although it probably won't.","Issues with additional players on the switch being restricted from much of the progression in the game really spoils the experience in this game.  I sure hope they add patches to fix this.  Until than, this game is definitely a pass.","Bridge building mechanic is complete trash and unusable until terraforming is unlocked. Please fix this nintendo, I\u2019m shocked that you released a game so broken. There are about 2 spots on my entire island that I can put a bridge and they aren\u2019t where I want them. Still have to use the cumbersome annoying vaulting pole to get anywhere. Fix this Nintendo. Make the bridges less finicky so that they\u2019re actually usable.","Great game with one crippling flaw that makes it near unplayable. One island per switch is either an inexplicable oversight or a shameless cash grab. The first person to set up the island is the only player that can progress the story and do anything significant to the island making it a pedestrian and boring experience for any other player playing on the same switch. Please Nintendo, either allow for co-proprietary rights between players on the same island or allow for one island per individual player. My wife started our island and I feel like an NPC when I\u2019m playing because I can\u2019t build houses, progress the story mode, or many other fundamental features of the game that make it what it is. The $60 price point is only worth it for the original creator of the island, while any other players on the same switch are not allowed access to $60 worth of features.","They purposely create problems only to try and sell you solutions later!You cannot backup your save files in any capacity that doesn't involve giving Nintendo MORE money than the roughly $260-$360 you spent in total just getting the game!They lock your save file TO THE SWITCH! This means you can only have ONE island PER CONSOLE! As if that isnt bad enough, if your Switch breaks you arpotential hours you spent playing will just be GONE unless you pay an additional $20 a year for cloud saving. Which who knows how long the lifespan of that could be in 4 years...","I have to quit playing because my family is ruining my experience. I'm the superfan who went out of my way to buy the limited edition console and preorder the game, launch it at midnight to start my island. In all the previous entries, excluding New Leaf, I shared towns with my family members over the decades of my upbringing. I understand why there's only one island per switch. Truly, I get it. For purposes of game manipulation, etc. Plus it keep the player's attachment to the island, since you can't make a new one without having to sacrifice the progress you've already made. They've done this in all the other entries! So it makes sense, of course. However, this is not the Animal Crossings that have come before. It offers endless customization. So how can I enjoy my island when my casual gamer family members are constantly ruining my island? With tires all over the land, hoarding the star fragments, buying all the items, giving animals random items to put in their homes, their own homes are ugly, their coordination is unbelievably bad, items everywhere, trash everywhere. I'm the only one working during this global pandemic, as well as a full time student. I want to spend an hour or two a day taking care of my island but when I get there, everything's already done or so horribly ruined that I can't bare to play. I can't believe I bought this and I bought a console just to play this. It's honestly damaging my relationship with my family and causing me to have even more negative feeling during this hard time. I'm so upset with Nintendo and they need to patch the game to fix it.","This is our families very first time playing Animal crossing. There are 5 people in our family they love to play on the switch. During this time of being quarantined in our home, we thought this would be a great game for the kids to take their mind off of what\u2019s going on in the world. The 5 year was the first to play the game, not knowing really how to read, he simply clicked through things and just started running around the island having a blast.  After that every other person in family played on their own users. We realized that we were all located on the same island. No big deal we thought. We each played for a few hours, but none of us could figure out how to make an axe. None of us had the option. After several frustrating searches we found out that since the 5 year old started the game first, he is the only one that can really play the game. Meaning that no one on the switch can make any decisions.  We had to delete all the saved data for everyone and start fresh on 1 user. This is unacceptable. The switch is meant to be a console with multiple players. Every other 1st Party Nintendo has a separate save system for each users own progression. Mario Kart, Zelda, Smash Bros.","The game itself? Fun, BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE ONE PERSON. If there is more than one person in your household who wants to play this, you have to buy a SEPARATE CONSOLE ENTIRELY for them to play on their own island.Incredibly disappointing. Just another way to gouge people for money.","Horrible 2nd player limitation and relationship breaker for Switch with shared users fighting for who will be the Owner and loser be a second class citizen/refugee with almost no fun.\rAs a new Animal Crossing player this is such a disappointment.","No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving No cloud saving","One island per console is the most asinine game design I have ever seen and there are no warnings about it anywhere from Nintendo before you buy the game. This has ruined the experience for my wife and me. I will be seeking a refund of this game.","Seriously Nintendo!? The whole \"one island per switch\" is the worst possible idea imaginable. I get the idea that Nintendo wants to stop \"cheating\" within the game, but couldn't they get around this by not allowing other users islands to interact? So essentially each user would have a completely different world. I spent $60 on this game to not even be allowed to enjoy it because I didn't start playing it first. Such a disappointment.","My brother can\u2019t have his own island. Sharing with him is troublesome and one of us is always left with no resources. NINTENDO, PLEASE FIX","One island per console is inexcusable and anti consumer practice. Instant 0/10","The Nintendo Switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console. Each player can have their own profile, and games saves are kept completely separate.\r Because of this, I was very surprised to discover that Animal Crossing: New Horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system. The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. Progress in the game for all players is also gated by the primary player's progress. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.\r If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the \"island representative\", while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game?\r Searching online I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying \"Animal Crossing has always been like that\", but:\r 1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.\r 2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.\r 3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.\r Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future.","So far from what I have seen, I am slightly disappointed with this game. I enjoy the new features such as the nookphone and the various quality of life fixes. The new museum looks AMAZING and the graphics look amazing as well. There are, however, many things I am disappointed with. For one, many staple NPCs of the series have been cut. Brewster, Redd, Dr. Shrunk, Harriet, Pelly &amp; Phyllis, and Katrina have all been cut. In addition, the art gallery has been entirely cut from the museum. Nook's Cranny now only has one upgrade. There are very few buildings to construct. The amount of buildings and facilities you construct would be equivalent to the amount of buildings and facilities that would be available day 1 in other games. Diving has been removed and the there are now only 6 different kinds of fruits. I am mixed on crafting. On one hand, crafting provides a new and fun way to create certain furniture and outdoor furniture. On the other hand, If you remove the crafting and the nook miles system from the game, this game would have no substance. I'll just put it this way, this is the first animal crossing game where I have had nothing to do except log in, play the game for a total of 10 mins, and sign out. Each animal crossing game released up to New Horizons was a culmination of everything great from the games previous. This is the first game in the series to regress in design and gameplay and that just doesn't sit well with me. This game was rushed and hopefully, with updates, this game can improve, but for now, this game is all style and no substance, and I'll be sticking to city folk or new leaf.","I bought this game, looking forward to sharing a beloved franchise with my kids.  I am deeply disappointed.\r Only the first profile to play gets a a game.  Everyone else gets to be a second class tourist.  Multiple profiles have to share that island, and only the primary player can travel to deserted islands, make building decisions, and things like that.  Instead of experiencing a beloved franchise, I have kids fighting over who gets to dig up fossils, collect the seashells for income, etc..etc...  The decision not to have separate islands for separate profiles is a decision that's baffling, cold-hearted, and bringing conflict to my household.","No Nintendo Just no. Nintendo you have to realize that families don't have multiple switches the switch is a family console and you decided to make it 1  island per switch. nobody is gonna buy a new switch just to have another island. The game was meant to be an island for you and only you you shouldn't expect people to receive this well. I have a sibling and we were ecstatic when we got this game. We got this game for primarily my sister but I was also ready to make my own island until i realized that me and my sister would have to share a island Now at first i was okay with this but then it set in that If i was the leader my sister couldn't pick up a branch. Nintendo please fix this. You will be praised if you will","My wife bought this game and we started playing it together. We enjoyed it a lot for a few days, until it turned out that I, as a second player, can't progress on the main quest on the island and really don't have any purpose. I had to order a second Switch console to be able to play this game, and now it is much more enjoyable. After playing with two separate switches I kinda see why it is the way it is. And having a separate console I can enjoy playing games on my own again. I was actually missing that a lot.","My boyfriend and I went halfsies on the game only to realise that one of us wouldn't even really get to play it properly. Pretty lousy of Nintendo - can't imagine 7 people happily being side characters in someone else's game as their only experience. I deleted my saves and let him have it since he's more excited to play, what a waste of my money.","Good game. Worth giving a 10/10. Dont understand why this game has a 5.4 audience rating.","Honestly I was waiting so long for this game and not being able to have separate islands for everyone playing on the switch kinda ruins it for everyone. Won\u2019t be buying future AC games if they are like this. Such a money scheme. The game was almost perfect.","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE OERSON IN YOUR BOUAE THAT PLAYS!!!!What a crock of **** Bought this game for my daughter but wanted to try it out. We can\u2019t have two islands?! What genius made this decision? And the solution is \u201cbuy another switch\u201d?! This needs to be fixed immediately. I would return the game if I could. I\u2019ve been playing games since the original Atari and this has to be one of the most selfish and idiotic decisions made by a gaming company. Way to step up during a time people are stuck inside....","It's a great game, but there is a big problem: when the first person who create your island don't play anymore or just less than you, you don't have a complete access to the game.","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT FOR LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (meaning more than one use in the same household).\r I cannot stress this enough as it will cause you no end of frustration, headaches, angry crying and resentment.  I say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game.  The only person that has any say or control or can actually do anything worthwhile is the VERY FIRST person to start playing the game on the console. Everyone else is literally just a slave to their whims.  i can't even sugar coat it because it's caused no end of anger and frustration for my partner and I when we've tried to play together.  They lost all interest as they literally couldn't progress the story, gain DIY recipes from Tom Nook, nor actually make any meaningful decisions within the Island (such as placing residents or setting up bridges or really doing anything of note at all).  They have stopped playing entirely and that has killed my joy as i'll never be able to play with them all due to Nintendo's greed.  For a company that stresses being the best multiplayer and family friendly console on the market they sure did a good job of tearing families apart with this title.  Like they've got great multiplayer function in almost every other game, yet decided to go money hungry with this entry for whatever reason.  Locking each switch to 1 Island (even if you have multiple ID's with multiple online ability, and even with multiple game codes purchased) is just terrible restrictive and straight up greedy (and i say this as they have yet to offer a valid reason for restricting it in this way so i can only make my own inferences)\r Understand that I'm not really upset at locking the switch to 1 Island per switch, that actually makes some sense to me.  The reason for the review being this low is the fact that they Advertise this game as a family friendly game, which it is clearly not, What is fun about being relegated to a servant of the first person to start the game?  If they simply added a function to change the Resident Representative in-game then none of us would have reviewed this with such vehemence.\r Think about this:  If this game was purchased for a household with multiple kids or in a house with multiple roommates that all love the AC series and looked forward to playing this, if for whatever reason the 'main' person who started playing (not even the one who actually bought it because they don't restrict it to actual accounts) was not able to play for an extended period of time, either due to illness, or they were stuck in quarantine at a different location, or they simply stopped playing, then you have effectively killed all progress and joy for the remaining members of that household.  NO ONE will be able to move the game forward so long as that player never plays again.  That is why we are all distraught over Nintendo's decision, and have every right to rate this game as such.  Nintendo never shed any light on this, because had a parent of children, or partner in a relationship known that the others they live with will NEVER have the same ability or privileges across the board then they wouldn't have purchased it in the first place.  Why cause strife intentionally when we're already dealing with everything else going on in the world?\r So i write this review, not to review bomb, but as a warning for all future purchasers to beware of what they'll be getting themselves into.\r Now that i've said that, to validate my review i will state that until we discovered this terrible game design decision, it was a really fun and enjoyable game to play, but i will not rate it higher than a 1 until Nintendo even acknowledges this issue let alone be proactive and fix it.  (A 1 because there was enjoyment at one point, but now no longer).","I have never played an Animal Crossing game before and decided to play this one for the first time. BIG MISTAKE! The fact that we get such a tiny island that we are forced to share it with other profiles is ridiculous. I can't enjoy the experience when someone else is taking all the resources and they can't enjoy the experience because I can't play often enough to advance the game. Even if we did delete the save file and start in their profile, it doesn't help because I still wouldn't be able to do anything without resources. This is the stupidest concept to force upon people and a giant waste of money. I feel ripped off and I want my money back!","One island per switch. My girlfriend likes it because I gave her the island. I hate this game because as a second \u2018player\u2019, I can do almost nothing.","Dont listen to the idiots it's a reallly good game I couldnt care about one island limit because I'm not a sad pathetic weirdo who is looking at anything they can to pick at the game if you got through your original save to fast shouldnt of time skipped you fool okay play it and see for yourself I really like it","Doing my part to lower this game's score to say \"f4ck you\" to Nintendo. I bought this as a game my wife would enjoy, and she likes it, but I can't enjoy it too because some poopbutts at Nintendo decided one island per switch was a good idea. You greedy S.O.Bs","DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS ONLY YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE SO-CALLED \"PRIMARY PLAYER\" IS LITERALLY THE ONLY PLAYER WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE TO CONTRIBUTE!!!!!! I almost gave this game a 10/10 until I realized how messed up compared to the rest of the ENTIRE GODDDAMN  SERIES!!! This is because when you start by needingkm to give Tom Nook 5 bugs or fish, only the primary player, which is my sister in my case (who PLAYS THE FREAKING LEAST)This game would get a 10/10 if there eren","I bought a switch and this game only to find I can only play it in an extremely limited way because my partner is the primary player on the island. Apparently you need to buy an additional switch in order to play the game. No problem if you\u2019re rich I guess. I can\u2019t believe what bloodsuckers the people at Nintendo are. They evidently have no concern for their users. I have paid money for a game I will never be able to play. It\u2019s absolutely horrifying that a game company could deliberately make this decision. It is simply unfathomable to me..","Can't unlock terra forming because im not the island representative... Why s this a feature???? I quit the game because i WOULD HAVE TO RESTART by buying the game again for a third time to get it right. Absolute joke. There is no possible way for me to unlock terra forming without restarting.","I set up this Metacritic account just to write this review, in the hopes it will get Nintendo's attention to correct this obvious flaw in Animal Crossing New Horizons.\r...\rWHY is there only one Island per console?  This is an UNFORGIVABLE SIN in Console gaming.  Please correct this obvious flaw immediately!  We have multiple player profiles on the console, and would like to each have our own Island.  Currently, only one of us can effectively play this game, with the other players in our home having to effectively just watch as the on Mayor of the Island plays the game.\r...\rCORRECT THIS NOW!\r....\rWe should be able to create multiple save games, and have multiple Islands on a single Switch Console.  Otherwise, the game is effectively meaningless.\r...\rCORRECT THIS NOW!\r...\rI am absolutely dumbfounded that Nintendo decided to make this decision.  I hope this issue is corrected quickly.\r...\rI am giving this game a zero score until this issue is corrected.","THIS GAME HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO ENTERTAIN FAMILIES BUY IT FAILS DRAMATICALLY. Trying to wrap my head around how Nintendo thinks they will make more money from people buying completely new switches for each sibling to just play Animal Crossing is so absurd. I really want to play this game to its full potential and run my OWN island that isn't my brothers island who is now crying because he wants me off his island. I CANT BELIEVE SUCH A BEUTIFUL AND SWEET GAME CAN CAUSE SO MUCH CHAOS. wow Nintendo ya did it again.","I got this game with my slightly smaller sister, we split the costs, and I decided that for once, I would be nice and let her try this game out first, fully expecting that we both could have our own islands. Turns out I was wrong. I spent 30 dollars of my own money for an experience that I will never have that my sister will, all because I was trying to be nice. This is a huge problem, and like many other negative reviews, I feel like the game is limiting me to a side character and nothing else. I still don't get why even on a system with a profile system Nintendo would still put in the one island per console thing.","For those who say \"I don't understand review bombing\" well try playing as \"villager B\" and come back","One island per console is a pathetic limitation and I will endeavour never to purchase anything associated with the game, its developers or its brand (Nintendo, too, shall be relegated to the dung heap of history as it was for me for decades before the Switch gave compelling reason for me to consider them before this blatant compulsion to buy a second console for one games' ease of use).","The Switch is marketed toward family gaming. Great. Then comes Animal Crossing the game which can only be enjoyed by one family member in the house because you\u2019ve decided to depart from the convention of allowing separate game saves. Was it a hired dunce that just didn\u2019t consider the obvious drawback this is? Or were the moneymen fat-eyed with greed so much so that somehow they thought it swell to entice families to go fully absurd and buy a whole new switch device for one freaking game? I have no issue leaping to a zero until this is fixed. What a ridiculous move that warrants just as ridiculous a response.","The bottle neck that is one island representative per Nintendo switch is by far the worst game mechanic imposed on players. If you have a single household switch and your spouse/partner/child get a hold of the game, create the island first, and talk to Tom and his son first, good luck progressing with the game. The first player who starts anything in the game is now the representative and if they quit a week later then you have to restart your entire island and progress to appoint a new representative. That could be hours upon hours of progress which you have to restart because of a broken mechanic. What\u2019s the point of a representative to begin with? Every save file should have their own island and Nintendo should allow people to progress at their own rates. Terrible game mechanic. If you own a switch with multiple people who play on it, avoid this game. It will create family feuds and will be a waste of your hard earned dollars if you\u2019re going to share the game.","At first, I was ecstatic to finally be able to play this game. I was having a lot of fun playing the game, but then I found out that you could only have one island per console. I live with my sisters and we all share the switch. Once I found out, I didn't want to play anymore and regretted buying it. This is just a ridiculous restriction. Literally Ultimate Smash Bros, you can have different save files. I know that only having one island per console is normal for Animal Crossing games, but for Nintendo to basically tell its consumers to buy another console for another island is stupid. Especially since the Switch goes for about $300 each right now. Jokes on me that I bought Animal Crossing, but I won't be a consumer of Nintendo anymore unless they fix this mess of a game.","Horrible servicio, como es posible que solo una cuenta pueda progresar y la segunda est\u00e9 tan limitada. No es justo que todos no tengan las mismas oportunidades","Three words: secondary players sucks. And it is not normal that for the fact of including the multiplayer, the second, third and on going players have to stuck in doing nothing instead of having their own islands and fully enjoying the game. The only good thing is the originality of including the crafting system","I bought this game for myself and my girlfriend. I thought it would be okay for both of us to play it, but that was not the case. The fact that each Switch console can only have 1 island in total, ruins the whole game if more than 1 person wants to play. I was looking forward to playing it, but as I want my girlfriend to have a good time with it, I am unable to play at all because of the huge restrictions put on anyone who is not the island representative. And when playing co-op together, all you can do is run around, equip tools and use them, and pick up items, which don't even go to your inventory, because you don't have an inventory. If you can play it alone, it's a great game, but as it stands, I can't play a game that I payed for. It's an absolute joke.","Lost my progress because nintendos stupid policy of not supporting cloud save","1 island per Switch, really Nintendo?! I bought the game and it's great but I can't play it because my girlfriend don't want me to mess up her island... So what now, I am supposed to buy an other Switch? Good one!","I've bought nintendo switch only to play animal crossing with my wife, but because of that ridiculous limitation that only one person is island maintainer and it cannot been changed, I am unable to progress with storyline on my account. Good advice: if you want to play in animal crossing with other person simply DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!","Lovely game... And I am a huge Nintendo fan, but I can't get over the fact that my partner and I can't have our own islands and our own individual games. I wouldn't even be that opposed to buying another copy of the game, but we'd need an entirely new switch console! We didn't know this, so my partner has now just been put on my island with no real way to progress with his own story and nowhere near the same immersive experience I had. I am so disappointed in Nintendo. I never normally bother rating games but this just feels like a massive, massive oversight.","This one island stuff is not acceptable for a game in 2020. We wan't to play the full expierence. Fix this.","This game deserves less than a zero, because if you share the game with another person, such as a sibling, one player will have all content locked behind a $200 paywall, because of the idiotic one island per console. I was excited to be able to experience this game, but my hopes were quickly crushed by this.","This game is a huge letdown. The camera is atrocious constantly blocking your line of sight preventing you from seeing what you want to do. The tool durability is retarded in a game where you spend most of your time using them. This game had potential but managed to piss it all away.","Unable to actually play the game I payed for because SO opened it first? How is this ridiculous cash grab allowed ? I am not gonna buy another switch to play a game just to have my own island.\rDo not buy if multiple people use the same console.","The fact that you can only have one island on a system is straight up garbage. I live with siblings and I am not too keen about sharing a island.","Brother started playing first, there is nothing to do when i start playing as second player. lets make a game about community but make anyone but the first player a second class citizen. extremely limit the amount of resources, and lock story progress to the first person. But its about the community right? Also no recipes for anyone else who wants to play but first player. It's almost as if they want you to buy another 300$ console and 60$ game.....almost like it worked for there sales.......","Only one island per switch? Terrible design decision.  What possible reason could they have for having this arbitrary restriction besides forcing people to buy more switches if they want their own island.\rSeems fairly on brand for Nintendo though.","The main game is great, a classic Animal Crossing experience with tons of new features and a great setting. It really is a lovely game.\r However, problems begin to surface when you want to play with another person. I purchased this game to make the corona quarantine easier for me and my gf, but as soon as her character arrived at the island (I arrived first), we found out she was nothing more than a 'secondary' citizen.\r She couldn't get new DIY recipes, participate in new projects, put things in the museum or even help with existing projects. Her progress was limited by mine, and since I don't play as much as her, she basically got a watered down version of the game.\r This is obviously a conscious design decision on Nintendo's part to encourage players to purchase more Switch consoles, since you cannot have more than one island on the same one. This creates a TERRIBLE experience for anyone who is not the first player - I can only imagine how much this would suck for a whole house of people who want to play together.\r This is similar in vein to how the online features are locked only to players with an online subscription. If they are not present - other local players can't play online, so the only way to work around this is to create the online subscriber's character in local multiplayer using another controller, and then just have them stand around, allowing other players to use online features. Again, a stupid, GREEDY design decision by Nintendo.","No spoilers here, have hardly played the game for one reason. You can only have one island per Switch so if someone else starts the game first it is their island and you can only do so much. Made me stop playing after an hour.","I bought animal crossing new horizons as a present for my wife but as a lot of people can understand it was also a present for myself. She had the first go at it and later when I sat down and switched to my account I find out that I cannot have my own island? I need to live on my wifes island? This is a crazy descision by nintendo and has ruined the game for me and countless others. There is no reason not to allow each user to have their own island except greed. Trying to force people to get a second switch. Shame on you nintendo","New Horizons is the first Animal Crossing game that has managed to keep me engaged for more than a few days, and I can see myself playing this one daily far into the future.  The mix between old and new parts of the 'formula' have finally created something that I deeply enjoy playing.  It's especially nice to have a little something pleasant to fall back on every day with the world currently going a little nuts over this whole virus situation.\r I'm sorry to hear that the way of handling multiple family members on the same console is so bad.  Seriously, it sounds terrible, and I think this aspect of the game could have been done a lot better.  I docked one point off my score for you guys... but only one point, because it doesn't affect my experience.  If you're planning on being the sole owner and player of this game like I am, it's absolutely wonderful!","If you people score the game a zero or a one out of ten on a tiny inconvenience that decidedly doesn\u2019t harm the overall experience unless you don\u2019t read up on what you need to do, you need to get over yourself. I have issues with the game, yes, but none of them are worth Metabombing the game over, and if you think it is, the game\u2019s not for you.","I was very excited for this game, in fact it was the first game that I got for Switch to play with my girlfriend or by myself. However my girlfriend started playing the game first and then I joined. Initially I thought, well it is ok that we can only have one island, I can at least contribute to it, but I was wrong. The single player game is non existent for the second player on the island. Then I thought, ok at least co-op should be good. But no co-op game is also pretty bad experience. So I gave it 2 because it is a good game for my girlfriend, but for me as the second player is waste of $60  .","Anima Crossing has it's charms but there is a TON of grinding (at one point it took me a week to get the 30 iron I needed to advance the game because I didn't realize rocks could be harvested without destroying them and you need to dig holes around them to cheeze the maximum amount out of them, I mean really?)\r In the end it takes a lot of work and you get items and abilities you want to decorate your tiny island but there is limited actual interaction and fun.","To the people who call the backlash an unjustified review bombing you probably are playing single player and have no issues. To rank a game on just a part of it and expect everyone else to ignore the giant issue and give the game an A+ is stupid. Also there were complaints about single island before the game even came out and they never bothered fixing it. The only way they are going to fix it is by people vocally saying \"It's a problem and making the game unenjoyable to many\".\r I wouldn't mind buying a 2nd copy of the game but needing a 2nd switch at the cheapest 260$ per switch plus the games 80$ each for a whopping total of 680$(CAD) for two people to enjoy their own island is absurd. There is no point in buying a 2nd console just for Animal crossing alone.  Nintendo is turning into Bethesda/Blizzard. Wouldn't be surprised if mtx and lootboxes or other \"surprise mechanics\" on the way.\r When you have a game that you own and can't even get yourself motivated to play it despite loving the genre and 100s of hours in past entries simply because you have two players and one console you truly deserve a 0.","I would return this, but I cant. I let my girlfriend play for a few hours, only to realize I couldn\u2019t make my own island after the fact. I want her to play it, but I bought it to enjoy myself. I guess I just can\u2019t play it now, fun.","Same as what everyone else is saying! 1 console 1 island, ridiculous.  What a transparent attempt at Nintendo trying to sucker people into buying more switch consoles.  Probably because the switch lite bombed so badly they are trying to get people to buy them.  It\u2019s ridiculous that at least make each paid online service account make their own island.  One per $300 dollar console is just unforgivable.  Me and my 2 daughter want to make our own islands, but no that will cost us an additional $720 dollars is Nintendo out of their f\u2019n minds? Whoever designed this game should be fired.","After hearing that you can only have one island per console, as well as the co-op experience being completely neutered, I won't be picking up the game unless it ever gets fixed.","Bought this game for my girlfriend and me so we could both play on our household Switch. Well, apparently the second player can't do jack ****. What a disappointment.","My girlfriend started before me on my switch so now I basically can't play it.\r The limitations put on all other players are unreasonable; don't expect to have ANY fun as any player but the main player. The second player to join an island cannot so much as craft a flimsy axe or craft a watering can. You pretty much can't play if you aren't the player that created the island. 1 island per switch is the most insane limitation nintendo has ever published.","Nintendo has made an interesting marketing decision for a supposed family company and directly put families in the ditch with how they\u2019ve decided to manage the saves in the game. They have decided that there can only be one island per SWITCH not per account which confuses me as a player since every other switch title (Pok\u00e9mon, Fire Emblem, Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley, Super Smash Bros Ult. and Mario Kart) all extremely popular titles and games that have brought the switch up to level with PlayStation and Xbox and they all have SEPERATE saves. I genuinely don\u2019t understand a player focused decision other than they want to make as much money as possible off of players. Please Nintendo, fix this for the people who love the game but also want to play it with their family members and even friends because I don\u2019t want myself or them to be forced to delete their save so that another person can experience the full game.","Como segundo jogador, quando entro na ilha o jogo simplesmente n\u00e3o vai a lugar algum. Todos os eventos do jogo para expandir a experi\u00eancia s\u00f3 podem ser feitas pelo primeiro jogador na ilha. Dropei do jogo em 2 dias pois \u00e9 completamente impratic\u00e1vel. Para minha esposa certamente seria uma experi\u00eancia melhor se ela n\u00e3o tivesses ficado t\u00e3o desapontada com esse problema com nossa pequena olha compartilhada que tamb\u00e9m abandonou completamente o jogo. Se fosse para ser um sistema assim t\u00e3o ruim, podia ao menos ter a op\u00e7\u00e3o de ilhas separadas.P\u00e9ssima experi\u00eancia","El animal Crossing mas completo hasta la fecha , montones de cosas por hacer y un modo online excelente , sin duda un obligado para estos momentos en que nos toca quedarnos en casa .","Juego innovador , mec\u00e1nicas nuevas , duraci\u00f3n alta , todo lo que el jugador necesita para pasar hrs y hrs en la isla","I am the only person playing on my Switch, so the primary issues related to multiple saves for multiple people on the same console has not affected me. These complaints are valid, but I can only speak honestly to my own experiences with this game.\r This is the perfect game to come out at the perfect time in the era of COVID-19. My daily routine now incorporates Animal Crossing  New Horizons. It would certainly be a good game if it came out at any other time, but here and now it provides a much needed routine and sense of comfort.","I brought the game for me and my little 7 year old to enjoy together, I feel terrible that my promises of a game we could share together were a lie. Nintendo cheated us royally on this.But tbh I could have overlooked it had Animal crossing been a good game when it's just not.Conversations are repeated over and over and over again every single day! Selling items takes forever! Loading screens take forever, tasks are boring and will drive you mad from the monotonous element of it. Everything is so slow, its not relaxing slow, just frustrating slow. There is no story at all! And I know it's not that sort of game, but you have to have some story... And it doesn't. I could go on and on and bore you to death like this game does to its players. Shame on Nintendo for this rubbish.","I'm very sad to see, people reviewing just a multiplayer bug and not the game. The game is so much fun. The world is open and colorful, the quests are perfect for the series and keep you looking for goals to complete. I have visited my son's island online and hes visited mine. That seems to work perfectly. I love the characters and the interactions in the game. Again, like I said in the beginning,  don't let a bunch of review bombers keep you from enjoying this game.","So bad. So boring. You do absolutely nothing. Bought this for my 6 year old, he was the second user, could do very little as all limited to main user. Tried to remove me, but had to delete ALL saved data (for both) in order to do that.","Fantastic game and fun to play. Although you can\u2019t have more than one island it doesn\u2019t bother me.

As \"resident representative\" you get to enjoy the whole game but the other (in theory) 7 players get a very limited experience.\r If they at least remove these limitations it can still be saved. Or even better, don't limit it to one island per console!","This may be a family friendly game but it is not a family game. Only one person can play this game at a time. You can not start a second island in a family game. Gameplay is good but I would only recomend  this game if you are buying it for one kid and dont plan to play yourself.This one decision ruined a otherwise fine game.","Review bombers have formed a very vocal echo chamber on here, but instead of focusing on the negatives that can be fixed, the game itself is objectively one of the best in the series. For those new to the AC experience, don't expect a ton of varied gameplay. ACNH is designed to be a relaxing life sim that has you return for short bursts of play rather than keeping you for hours at a time.\r ACNH has the most customization of any Animal Crossing title, allowing a wide variety of furniture and decorations to be customized to your liking.\r It is obnoxious that there is only one island per console, and that player 2 really doesn't have much to do until the main player progresses, but a lot of these issues were disclosed well before launch.\r It is still a great game, and it is still Animal Crossing.","Crashes and game breaking bugs (blocked invited villager houses)Local play disconnects frequentlyAmiibos are not supportedShared save file with all users on console (breaking the multi user OS sandbox)Full of exploits and cheats (item dupe, time warp)Real time based with limited time window in-game events (12 pm real time = 12 pm in game)Can't play and fully enjoy all content unless you change your real life schedule","why why why only 1 island for 60$ that unacceptable cant share the game with others","\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0447\u044c? \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.","People are giving this a 0 out of 10 because of one missing feature and honestly I would have gave this a 10 out of 10 if local multiplayer was better.

Why does player 2 only exist to exist and nothing more? Why am i practically forced to suck the dick of someone i don't wanna play with when i just wanted to play ALONE? And why the hell did Animal Crossing on Gamecube have a better island system than the newest game on the Nintendo Switch? I would say something positive but i haven't been able to play the ****ing game, so uh... i can't.","A lot of the negative reviews are about the shared island and not the actual gameplay which is fantastic","If you want another save File you have to purchase a 300$ switch again? If Sony or Microsoft did this they would be finished. Animal Crossing is not a 10/10 but it is a 0 when there are no save files for a game that had 5 years of development wow","I honestly fell left behind when playing this game. It feels like I am an NPC in this game. So here is the jist, I bought the game the day after it came out, I more or less bought it on impulse. I let the game download, and my brother got his mitts on it and began the game.  I just got on, and learned that I have to share the island with him. Now this alone, I can get past, what bugs me is that IM LIMITED ON WHAT I CAN DO. What I can do is 100% reliant on my brother's work, it is VERY poor game design. It is GREEDY to make your customers buy ANOTHER SWITCH. You can't even cloud save... This game is fun though. Like I normally don't play games like this, but from my limited amount of things I can do, I enjoyed it. Usually I love Nintendo and their products, but this is the first time I have felt cheated by them. I'm sure this game deserves a higher score, alas, I haven't played Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I've played Animal Crossing: New Horizons - The Demo.","the game is just amazing and charming,\rmust play earnd.\r(oh yeah and the game is looking amazing and I still didn't have frame rate issues)","This is everything I've ever wanted in an animal crossing game. My only complaint is the durability on tools. Everything else is wonderful so far. I hope those leaving negative reviews actually get the chance to play this amazing game.","It is unacceptable that nintendo made it so second player literally gets almost no game. Second player will not even have 1% of the privileges first player has. The worst thing is that nintendo will not do anything about it because they did it on purpose, to sell more consoles. I once again day, **** you nintendo for ruining the experience.","The 0s are absolutely ridiculous. The game has a fewer minor annoyance, but it's easily one of the best games of all time.","Preface: I've been playing animal crossing since the gamecube game and AC is one of my favorite gaming series of all time... that being said, this game is a bit of a disappointment.\r Things I like:\r-Customizing island via terraforming\r-crafting items as a means of gaining furniture\r-the island tours\r-the graphics\r-the music\r- ability to place items outside\r- the fencing system\r-the general gameplay\r- camera controls inside home\r-Happy Home Designer inspired customization features inside of home\r Things I don't like:\r-Very lacking list of obtainable furniture\r-No nintendo items\r- many missing furniture sets from previous games\r- The available furniture is uninspired and bland\r-only two stores available, no brewsters, no kicks, no garden store\r- No ressetti\r-No art, Redd, or art wing of museum\r-Nooks store only upgrades once\r-Can't buy crafted furniture from catalog\r- crafting tools is nothing more than an annoyance\r- Golden tools break so there's no point in unlocking them\r- Isabelle telling me absolutely nothing at the beginning of every day\r- the fish and insects are no longer animated when viewing the fish/insect dex\r- not fish/ bug sizes\r- I've already said this in a way... BUT HAVING TO CRAFT TOOLS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS MADDENING\r This game took 2 Steps forward with the increased customization of the island outside of one's home, placing furniture outside is great and really changes the game - but this game took 50 steps back with all of the cut material. All in all, its a decent enough game and I have enjoyed my time with it... but I'm starting to realize how empty it is. It really just makes me want to go back and play animal crossing new leaf. If i'm only going to have two stores anyways, I'd rather play wild world.\rBeing able to customize the island is cool and all, but it really doesn't make up for losing so much of what has made this franchise great. I hope that more of the cut content is added in the future. If we never get more shops, and nintendo items aren't added, I can't see myself playing this game for very long. I'll likely go back to new leaf or wild world. In those games I absolutely loved getting all the furniture I could in order to make my house as unique and homely as possible... in new horizons I have three rooms, two of which are completely empty because the furniture I have obtained is so boring...\r Thanks for reading.","Great Animal Crossing game. Missing stat mechanics and little charms stains the experience but the game is now friendlier to all new players. Hopefully they add substantial DLC to this title as it needs it.","I had been looking forward to this game for a long time, but unfortunately I share my switch console with another AC player. So now I have to share an island and when I log on there aren't even sticks left to complete the DIY workshop. On top of that if I want my own island I can't even blow money on a second copy of the game; I would have to buy an entire new console. What a joke.","i didnt like it, so having abdominal cramps as so much money wasted.\rso im warning others to not get simped","Pinche juego culero, la verdad es una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo. Mejor ahorren su dinero y compran Skins en Brawhalla.","The game is by far the best animal crossing. It takes every animal crossing game &amp; expands upon it. Which is everything we ask for in sequels. HOWEVER my only complaint is it\u2019s not innovative for this day &amp; age. The first animal crossing will always be timeless because of what it was for it\u2019s time. Still, new horizons does not disappoint.","The best Animal Crossing game ever. I'll be playing for months!Online is bad but that's Nintendo, they're afraid of the internet...A lot of love and care put into the development of this game. Watch and Learn, Gamefreak.","Probably the best game I\u2019ve ever played. Animal crossing New Horizons is a wonderful and relaxing game especially during this tough time.","Big disappointment, this game is a glitchy unfinished mess. I feel so bad for the families that have to deal with the one save file per switch rule. So many completely unnecessary limitations and paywalls imposed by Nintendo. This feels more like a predatory mobile game than an expensive console game we waited YEARS for.","As a Animal Crossing veteran since gamecube days, i have to say this is the BEST Animal Crossing game made. It has charm, character and longevity, all put into one cute world. I would highly recommend you playing this game and not listening to the negative comments...","One island per Switch is horrible decision. Why I can\u2019t change island with my girlfriend, who was 1st player? I don\u2019t want to buy another Switch","Even though the game starts off slow, once you get into things and upgrade your tent the game is truly magical. Super relaxing to complete tasks, gain nook miles and explore your island.","I know about the rating bombing of Animal Crossing and yes the online issue is that...an issue.But this is a guilty pleasure.  So there isn't a MAIN directive of the game but none of them are really.  It's a an awesome game if you overlook the internet flaw.","For all I know it may be an amazing game. However, after playing it for an hour, I was bored to tears. Even new leaf wasn't as boring in the first hour and I disliked that animal crossing too. I've played every animal crossing game and have to say that this one just didn't interest me. The most important role for any media is to hook the players, and this game failed miserably in that regard.","only one island for each console is unacceptable, specially for a family console as the switch just a reflect of how incompetent Nintendo can be with multiplayer stuff","I love animal crossing games, and so II bought this for me and my girlfriend. She played first and i was super excited to start my own island when it came my turn.. but i couldnt. I had to play on her island and i was extremely limited to what i could do. Its very clear this is her island and im just a glorified visitor who can never have my own island, unless I buy a new switch. This just plains sucks and nintendo is either being greedy or stupid idk how they thought this was a good idea.","I don't know if it's just me, but this game seems like an awful grind. Furthermore, the grind comes from having to wait until the next day or 3 for construction or other things to happen. It's kinda sad when I only play for 30-40 minutes at a time, run out of stuff to do for the day, then shut it off to wait for tomorrow. Maybe it's just me, but I'll stick with Minecraft.","a-lot of the negative reviews are from hardcore gamers who play fps games and use x-box 1's  if you are that type of gamer than good on you but this isn't an fps game, or a hardcore survival game, this is a very casual game definitely worth everyone's time and, i won't spoil it but it takes everything we loved about the gamecube game and fthe following games and expands on the things we loved.","So many angry reviews on this one because of the one island per console feature. I'm not entirely sure why people are so surprised given this is information that's been commonly known for months now.\r Anyway, I think this game is perfect. The graphics are extremely polished and there's always something to do. The pacing can be extremely relaxing, or you can time skip to get things done quicker. Strongly recommend if this is your type of game.","Love the game. As someone who has been playing since Wild World, it\u2019s a universal fact that you\u2019ve never been able to have more than one town/island on any console. If you decided to buy the game as a new player AND didn\u2019t do your research? That\u2019s your bad. Animal Crossing has been the same each and every release in this aspect, and that\u2019s your fault.The updates of New Horizons compared to New Leaf is incredible. I love being able to see the leaves and flowers move with the wind, or the fact that we can decorate outside of our homes. It\u2019s created a new found desire to play the game each day!","This game is extremely cute, I\u2019ve played it every day since release and I can\u2019t get enough.","Game is fantastic, the graphics, music , museum is beautiful, crafting system is fun, sucks one island per console but I always found animal crossing to be a single player game anyways. But doesnt justify a rating of 0. Good portion of people who complain is that they want to have more than one island to have different themes .. not all complaints are  from families.","I'm giving this a 4 for the same reasons mentioned by everyone else. It's good fun, and may even be a 10/10 game if you play alone or are the creator of the island on your console. However, bring the #2, #3, etc... Sucks. Really bad. You're totally incapable of advancing the storyline and are left to just collect resources for the #1 player. In fact, several important recipes are also unavailable to you as a secondary player. It's just insane that Nintendo thought this was an OK mechanic to have in this game, and it really ruins an otherwise wonderful game.","Animal Crossing New Horizon is a great new entry to the series. While I have a couple of complaints, the good outweighs the bad BY FAR. As a cute, slice of life game, its thrilling to see your villagers come to life around town and build up the game from the very beginning. It really feels liks you have a good grasp of every aspect of the island. I understand people are upset that you only have one island per switch, but thats the point? You build and decorate together. And I am a bit disappointed that not everyone can contribute to the development of land, but thats similar to New leaf as well. All in all, the game is lovely and deserves more than what most if these terrible reviews give it.","This game is a lot fun &amp; I honestly think it's unfair that people are giving the game a bad review for something that has been the same with EVERY Animal Crossing game. It's always been one save file. I love working towards building my town, the only reason I didn't give it a full 10/10 is that  the item menu options &amp; the touchiness of the A button when I'm near a tree can make it a little frustrating. Especially with the item menu where drop item is at the first option, I have dropped several medicines because of it   But overall it's a relaxing &amp; fun game.","This is one of the most charming,Enjoyable,And relaxing games i\u2019ve ever played In my life.100% worth trying","This is a fantastic game. I've only had it for five days, but I'm obsessed. It's super cute and relaxing. Great for this time while I'm stuck inside.","Literally the only thing i dislike about this game is how quickly my tools break, forcing me to recraft them.","Totally time absorbing. Really has the iconic animal crossing feel with a little bit of a twist which I feel is needed as I've aged with the series. I would give this a 10 but that is only due to the island's being on the slightly smaller size to my liking as the previous versions had just a tad more breathing room. My gf and I our currently playing on our own switch and have had no issues with connecting to one another and going doing our own thing or helping each other gather resources. It is a solo based playthrough/gameplay but with the added touch of a very easily setup multiplayer system, we have enjoyed it a lot with each others company. I'm unsure how are complaints of a shared world is a problem as this is how it's always been in which individuals shared their island/continent with other family members but if this does not effect you, you will have a really great time in animal crossing.","If you've ever played any of the previous Animal Crossing games you know what you're in store for. Cute animals, rewarding milestones, and tons of collectable furniture. The objectives and rules can be nebulous at times, but that is classic Nintendo. The only downer is how cluncky the multiplayer is. Everything stops and everyone is treated to a loading screen  whenever another player joins or leaves an island.","This game is VERY good. Relaxing gameplay and is a nice break from higher paced games for me","People need to get over themselves. Does it suck that it is one island per switch? Yes, but it has been that way since the FIRST GAME. One town per memory card. Convenient people forget that huh? The game is fine, a new twist on the formula.","I\u2019m not sure if the majority of the people giving a zero rating for being unable to have more than one island per switch have ever played Animal crossing before but it\u2019s always been that way. It seems a little harsh to completely bash the game because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s history and made your own assumptions. Aside from that, I did feel that the tools breaking is more than inconvenient, and I also wish you could work your way up to getting a tool that is unbreakable.","The game is great. I was an avid player of New Leaf, and this game is an improvement in most ways.\r The graphics are amazing. I actually love taking pictures in my little town because of how pretty the water is and how nicely my character is rendered. Catching critters and chopping trees feels the same as New Leaf, which is to say, good. I really appreciate the ability to choose where the other villagers live and being able to place furniture outside. Overall it's a very strong addition to the series.\r That being said, I hate that the tools can break now. It's pretty annoying when you're in the middle of a long spree of fishing or catching bugs and your tool breaks in the middle of it. I hate tool durability in general, but in a game that's supposed to just be about chilling out and having fun, this feels more like a chore. The crafting system as a whole is sort of meh to me, and I'm sure I won't like it more as my playthrough goes on.\r Overall I'm giving this game a ten purely because Animal Crossing is always going to be one of my favorite comfort games, and New Horizons is an amazing update to the franchise.","Another peaceful and relaxing game from Animal Crossing. I love the cute characters that you can have move in to your island and all the customisation options. I also love how it\u2019s done in real time. It keeps you coming back for more!","already my 2020 goty, played it for about 35 hours now and i love it!!!!!!!","This new AC game is far beyond anything I or anyone could have hoped for. It is still AC and for those who played New Leaf you will find many similar aspects suck as the first person being the community rep like being the mayor in new leaf.\r For those who read the negative views about one island per switch seem forget that you only got one town per save, 3ds, or gamecart like the previous games. If you had a digital download of new leaf you only got one town per 3ds. You get one island per switch because that's where the save data is saved to. Like a ps4 or xbox you don't save data to the disk you save to the system.\rThe local play could be reworked to be better but if you are done being a helper you can change leaders allowing the new leader to do everything they couldn't before. And with anything new in a series it will still need more work before it is perfected.\rThe only complaint i really have would be tool durability but a tool breaking is a minor inconvenience as being stung by wasps when you shake a tree and there is plenty stuff around to make new tools its not even a problem.\r I honestly find my self just opening the game and listening to it so i can sleep. There is far more goals and things you can do now. And one of the best features we have always needed is the bug and fish critterpedia tells you if something has been donated so you don't need to  scour your museum to see what your missing from what you caught. This game is beyond peaceful and is the next step towards wasting months of my time like new leaf and those before it.","Enjoying this game so much so far. Really feels like a great, undated version of the original DS game. I don't really understand why everyone is complaining about the multiplayer. It's been fine for me so far.","Excellent. Visually adorable. Music is fantastic. So many things to do plus cute characters. Child friendly with really cool gameplay. Love it.","When you need a break from life and you want to chill with some animal friends, gather fruits, explore, build and feel like you have a great vacation on your own island - Just play Animal Crossing!","As a long time animal crossing fan, this game is a dream. It was more than worth the wait. Heck, I would've waited even longer.","This is the best animal crossing game! So addicting! There is so many things to do!","It's an amazing daily time waster I enjoy. It could be improved sure,  maybe next iteration, but as of now the formulae works and I am fine with this version.  Also if they were to make it open world or have an infinite amount of towns, your town wouldn't mean anything or be special.  It wouldn't be Animal Crossing.","I've been playing the game nonstop everyday, I love it! This game came out at the perfect time seeing as how everyone is locked in their homes","Definitely the best Animal Crossing game, my fave switch game too probably. The games have always been made for sharing and it was common knowledge before release that it was one island per console. People be butthurt ","I think everyone on here bashing it and giving it\u2019s a 0 because Nintendo locked it to one island per console is an a s s h o l e. So I\u2019m rating it 10/10 to offset all of the negative reviews. Enjoy buying 2 switches!","Amazingly fun, never gets old, never run out of things to do. Graphics are extremely well done. The creativity and options are awesome. Absolutely fantastic game!!","It's a really good game, I loved this game, I want to play more. This is a game that you can do what you like, the villagers has personality and you can like that one and not like this one. Is a simple game, but very especial","Amazing, frankly, one of the best games I have ever played. Emphasis on \"I\". This series isn't for everyone (which you can clearly tell by the 0 reviews from action junkies), but once you get into it, it's one of the most fun experiences out there. Just set your expectations right, and have fun.","I decided to tune in and let everyone reading know that Animal crossing New Horizons is a wonderful game in the Animal crossing series. The sales and positive reviews speak for itself, but there is a lot that could be improved. I would of liked to see more streamlined menus, sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit slow, an option to speed things up would of been nice, and with the multiplayer, I think the way we invite other players to our town could of been more streamlined and have less loading screens.\r One big complaint people have is with the way Nintendo decided to handle multiple users playing. You can only have 1 island, and the first person to launch the game is basically the one in charge, the 2nd player has a slightly limited experience, for instance, you have  to wait for the 1st player to trigger certain events such as building Tom nooks store, or deciding on where to place a bridge, and until they do that, your island will be kind of locked in a state where you don't have access to those things until player 1 unlocks them. On one hand it is a bad decision, given how there are better ways this could of been managed, but on the other hand this is Nintendo, and their vision, and this is how all animal crossing games have been more or less. However I think they should of went the extra step with multiple residents living together and I hope that they can improve things even more in the coming patches or next release.\r While this game is amazing and has things that can be improved, I think a lot of the review bombing is from people that have a serious case of \"You didn't make the game I wanted you to make and now i'm upset\". Life goes on people, you don't like something, speak up, but review bombing a game in this manner is just silly.\r 9/10","A beautiful game. This game is full of relaxing music and actions. It hits home where other games in the series shine. It add new and interesting game play that makes your island yours. Now you will e seeing reviews annoyed Bout the how you can only have 1 island per console. This personally doesn't bother me and I play with 4 other people. It's fun to play bulld our island together. Plus it's true to past animal crossing games","Amazing game. It's a shame that people are giving such a harsh review for one aspect of the game. An aspect that doesn't affect game play at all. To say it's a great game, but then giving it a 1 or a 0 out of 10, is childish. Animal Crossing New Horizons is everything I have expected it to be and more. It is an easy 10 out of 10 for me and I hope that people still but it and don't let these ridiculous reviews sway them in any way.","Yeah I got addicted to this it's really great! It could have a better multiplayer, but that's about it.","This is a wonderful game that doesn\u2019t deserve these petty 0 review scores. You have a problem? Contact Nintendo. This game gives me something to look forward to every day while I\u2019m stuck in quarantine, much like the rest of the world. I love playing multiplayer with my online friends and collecting all the fossils, bugs, and fish for the absolutely gorgeous museum. The new interior design mechanics are a lifesaver and I love this game so much. Please give it a try, and don\u2019t listen to those petty 0 reviews akin to a whiny five year old child not getting what they want.","The game is a wonderful, peaceful, and adorable masterpiece that is probably the best of all previous animal crossing games. Although I was initially distressed at the shared island for multiple users, now that I'm used to it it's actually a fun little feature. Overall amazing and relaxing, definitely worth it!","The game is fantastic. Just as it always has been. Giving us a clean slate with absolutely nothing on the island gives us a new challenge like we've never had before. To those people who are review bombing the game, take your extremely weak minded comments some where else. You are ruining a good game with your nonsense. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Throwing a zero at a game because of one single thing. Shame on you.","Animal Crossing has been a series beloved by many, and for good reason. It is a feel-good, calm and open-ended game that allows the user to live a second day-to-day life among the animals of the world. Animal Crossing: New Horizons stays true to that formula - in some cases - while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series.\r New Horizons drops the player into a deserted island setting with two other random villagers. You are here by order of Tom Nook and his apprentices Timmy &amp; Tommy, who have set a vacation package for you. You start off the game in a cycle of material grinding and crafting, almost as if you just started a new Minecraft world. The newest functionality in the series to date here is the crafting and use of raw materials. You will build tools (a lot), harvest raw materials from rocks and trees, and continue crafting each day to make new furniture, fulfill any requests Tom Nook lays out for you, and to even build some homes.\r While there are no true end-goals or end game, Animal Crossing has never been about that. The game does give a player a general direction, in which you and Nook will build the island into a bustling little community, where you have complete control on housing location, bridges, inclines, and even the terrain! The creativity mixed with the endless amount of items there seems to be leaves for many to dump hours daily into a series you would typically only play for an hour or so every so often. This in addition to the Nook Miles, a set of finite and smaller infinite goals, allows for an addictive and repetitive game play experience. House decorating has received a major overhaul with the new drag and drop editor (a godsend!). The developer definitely focused a lot on small details too, with the gorgeous graphics depicting realistic rain, wind rustling the trees and weeds, detailed bugs and fish, and even the ability to eat fruit for a reason!\r While New Horizons expands in many ways, there are some choices that have left the game feeling a little bit lonely, and others confused. Things such as Gyroids and the Cafe, or other staples of the series are completely missing. The Happy Home Academy no longer has a cool online showcase of player homes, and has gone back to simply sending you random gifts each week. A lot of the Nintendo-themed game items seemed to have disappeared, and the ones available have become extremely harder to obtain and there are few of them. One of the saddest changes to me so far seems to be with your villagers. There are so many to possibly have move in, but unlike older games where villager interaction was a major part of what you do, it feels very stripped down in New Horizons. Villagers, more often than not, repeat the same dialogues each day, and usually don't have much to say in general. It's rare to get one caught on a tangent, or ask you random questions, or request your help finding an item. In New Leaf you could even play games like Hide and Seek with them, but in New Horizons it seems they'd rather stay home or stretch in the town plaza and say a couple blips to you and that's it.\r Lastly, multiplayer and the handling of saves naturally come into the discussion. A lot of people have shared concern over the fact one system has one island, and while it might be shocking to new players, this isn't the only Animal Crossing to function this way. One system usually holds one world for multiple players to play on. While they have locked progression to the first user; a bad call in many ways, the overall state of it is typical here but I can see why it would obstruct the fun for many families or couples who only have one switch. General multiplayer, especially online and local wireless, is basic and for that its fun. You can set best friends, and you can all visit each other's islands to talk to locals, hang out, and acquire materials. No qualms there.\r Lastly, we have to look at the save backups. There currently exist no way to do so, but they have stated they're working on a system to cater to those that need it.\r New Horizons is an amazingly fun and addictive title with beautiful graphics, cheery and calming music, and endless creative possibilities. While it's a great AC game, many series fans will be bummed about the loss of many series mainstays and might find it lacking for that matter, but it has become widely accessible for that reason, and I can safely say it is a wonderful game and I can't recommend it enough for its gameplay and aesthetic alone.","It\u2019s really cute and fun. It makes me smile and if you want some fun to pass the time pick it upPeople are review bombing it because they don\u2019t like one island per switch.But that doesn\u2019t affect me and is a perfect game for me.If your lonely and want some friends pick up this game","This game is just awesome! Everything about the game is so polished, cute and well-made! I just know this is a game I will be spending the majority of my quarantine time on as well as many more hours after! My favorite game on switch and the best game in the Animal Crossing series so far!","Finally an animal Crossing where we can put our leave down outside of our house and it can actually be the object. Even though animal crossing in the past was played for years in our house--including my elderly mother who played happily played 'A New Leaf' from the day it came out until now;  Our hopes finally came true with New Horizons. I like that when we go into our house we can turn the toggle switch so we have a 360\u00b0 view of each room. I wish we could do that on the outside of the house as well. ","I have played Animal Crossing since the very first game was released. New Horizons is what we've all been waiting for. It is absolutely PERFECT. I didn't sleep for two days because I couldn't stop playing this game. I HIGHLY recommend this game for everyone of all ages. :-)","Not the greatest game on the switch, but definitely a great game nonetheless.\r This game retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements, such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside.\r Many people are having issue that multiple users on the same switch can only play on the same island, however this has been a staple of the series since the beginning. Don't believe the review bombers, this game is worth your money. Being able to play on the same island can be a fun experience. You and your other islanders can work together to make a little piece of paradise. It is true that only the first character made can go though the starting tutorial, but this is honestly a great choice as it can be slow and put many people new to the series off.","I have been a massive fan of the Animal Crossing franchise for a while. Love the whole updated feel the game gets on the Switch, so many little details left out of earlier games look soo much better on this console. Having fun with friends trying to get all the different fruits so I can grow my little fruit empire, and a great way to pass the time while stuck indoors.\r The crafting can be a little grinding at times, but when you have nothing else planned for the day, then I shall chop wood and hit stones to my heart's content.","Great game! So much fun and so much to do. They really stream lined a lot of stuff to make it quicker and easier which I really appreciate.","This game tweaks so many tiny irritable game parts of the series past that adds to a game you can play all day.","Il gioco \u00e8 stupendo, non capisco perch\u00e8 la gente si debba sempre lamentare! Un 6,3 di media io non lo posso accettare. Vi meritate solo FIFA 20/21/22/23 Etc. Comprare un gioco per poi lamentarsi \u00e8 da ipocriti.","It\u2019s just a great fun game. Perfect for your kids of any age, perfect for you (assuming your an adult), perfect for your parents. Don\u2019t let the user reviews fool you AC is overall just like the classic one I played as a kid. The customization is great, and I love the island vibe. The one downside IMO is the fact only one player, the first to start the game, is the the only one who can progress the \u201ccampaign\u201c game. Everyone in my house wants to help, which was the case in the older games. A must buy game for the switch . In fact it\u2019s a \u201cmust buy switch to play the game\u201d type of game haha","The game is a much improved version compared to others. Friends and I have played it almost nonstop since it came out because of how much there is to do at any given times. The customization features are phenomenal! Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy breezy game to relax with .","I got New Leaf a little bit back and loved it so I was so excited for New Horizons. SO WORTH IT! It's exactly what I wanted and more. If you like Animal Crossing or have never tried it, give it a shot. Very charming, calm, and gives you things to do everyday.\r Also Imagine review bombing this amazing game just because you didn't properly inform yourself on the game and only having one island. Is it a bad feature? Lol yeah. Is it worth a 0? HAHAHAHHAHA no. One bad feature doesn't mean the game is awful.","I started playing Animal Crossing years ago on the Game Cube, have played almost every version on every platform and have been waiting for a full console game for years. I am thrilled with this game and have been trying to pace myself. They\u2019ve made enough changes to make the game fun to play while keeping enough of the traditional Animal Crossing pieces that there is still familiarity. I can\u2019t wait to continue in the game, fill my museum, and customize my island!","Una obre de arte que sali\u00f3 justo en tiempos de cuarentena, el juego tiene progresi\u00f3n calmada, buen soundtrack y personalizaci\u00f3n de personajes","Es uno de los mejores juegos para relajarse y jugar un rato d\u00eda a d\u00eda, es muy entretenido y si te enganchas no vas a poder parar de jugarlo. Sin duda alguna el mejor Animal Crossing que ha salido y un muy buen juego por si solo.","Please stop the review bombing this game is beautiful and relaxing animal crossing has never supported more than 1  town nothing is changed by this game not supporting it.","Game is real good. Wonderful evolution for the series. Ignore any 0\u2019s you see on here. Just head the warnings if you\u2019re looking for local play on one console. Doesn\u2019t take away from the games wonderful atmosphere.","Muy divertido, te lo pasas genial jugando y el tiempo vuela. 100% recomendable!","Absolutely wonderful game with fun stuff to do.  Great for relaxing,  customizing and learning new things. Take it a day at a time with this one.","This is an amazing game!! People have to many personal expectations. if you want to live on a deserted island this is the game for you. Its suppose to be about you alone building a relation with the island dwellers. Its fun and amazing. Don't listen to haters!! Life's a game, play it!","One of the best games Nintendo has published in years. Very addicting game play and charming characters. I know this will be a beloved game for years to come and not hard to say it\u2019s an instant classic","I bought it so my girlfriend and I could play. Well as in sure you are all aware, that's not how it worked out. I inabilty to have more than one island per console really upset us. At this point it's her game and I'll stick to my PS4.","I've never been a HUGE fan of the franchise, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons quickly caught my attention with its gorgeous art style and large amount of content. Above all that, this is the most fun I've had with any switch game, and it's also the most relaxing game I've played in such a long time. The sheer amount of joy this game emits will put a big grin on your face and urge you to play more. As soon as you think there isn't anything to do, just talk to Tom Nook and he'll give you at least three different tasks. Albeit the start of the game is a little slow, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons is absolutely brilliant, the perfect escape to our current quarantine situation, and is already a GOTY contender.","It's a fantastic game. Just fun to play. Nice and relaxing.  The Island is a bit small but it doesn't change the overall fun of the game. People have been giveing this game a 0 just beacuse it only gives you one island per switch and while that could be a minor annoyance it doesn't take away from the fun of this game at all.","Can only have access to one island per console. No good to me or my misses as we can't play individual games. Sold it, lost \u00a310. May rebuy the game if they update it but it's not looking likely. Utter ****","I cannot believe this game will only allow 1 island per switch. Not even 1 island per game card, which even then is ridiculous. I want to play this so badly but to do so I need to buy a WHOLE other switch? Despite not agreeing with even needing another game card at least it would mean I can still enjoy this game and I would have totally done so. This greed by Nintendo is very disappointing to see as I have always been such a big fan of them. The entire premise of the console is to be for family and sharing yet they pull a stunt like this. Very disappointing Nintendo I hope they fix this soon.","Not being able to have multiple islands is a joke and giving one person all the control is worse. For my family to enjoy it besides just one of us I\u2019d have to buy another switch? What a joke Nintendo needs to fix this","Even though the game itself is great and as gorgeous and fun as any of its predecessors, I can't think of any reason why Nintendo could have thought that ruining the experience of any other player except the 1st one was a great idea. I would love to give it a much higher score but the fact that the 2nd player becomes so dependable of the 1st one and misses out so much makes this animal crossing worth much less.","Really the only score being so far behind in game play. One island not good enough.","It is extremely disappointing that essentially only one user is able to enjoy the full game. Why in the world am I (2nd user) not able to create my own island in any way? I would pay for my own Nintendo online account if it would let me, but instead I get to essentially just be support to my wife\u2019s island. It\u2019s a shame that Nintendo is doing this because I will NEVER buy a Nintendo product again.","It's a good game, but the first player getting to do all the fun stuff makes it unplayable for my wife and me. Nintendo please fix your game :(","Must play! This game is fun and addicting, a game that I can enjoy during quarantine!!","The game itself is very relaxing and fun to play, and has load of customization. if you plan to play solo, I highly recommend it.\r My complaints arise when it comes to multiple people playing. I think that the decision to have one island per console, to build the community with those you play with would be understandable... IF other players had the same influence as the main player.\r It is understandable to not want certain people to be able to modify the island, but it isn't an option to choose, extra players past the first are automatically restricted in what they can do. It seems like it should be simple to give the main player the choice of allowing others the same management privileges as they have.\r In addition, recipes obtained through the storyline have no reason to NOT be mailed to the other players. It's silly and needs to be changed. Crafting is shown as a big focus, and losing a LOT of customization options for absolutely no good reason is ridiculous.","My favourite game in the series since Wild World on the DS. Progression is fun. Visuals are impressive. Characters are charming.","Some of the most fun I\u2019ve had co op with my wife ever . I am new to the animal crossing series because I never saw the appeal . After spending a week with the game I can say this is some of the best co op experience I\u2019ve had with my wife ever . It\u2019s very relaxing to go through and get out challenges for our nook miles . Every day brings someone new to do . I look forward to seeing more updates and expansions that they have planned for this .","Was looking forward to playing this but when i joined i was the second on the island and so missed out on the full intro and welcome onto the island as well as access to tools and other features. which makes the game unplayable and a completley soured experiance for anyone sharing a console.\r From a single player perspective the game is charming and the gameplay is what you can expect if you have played an animal crossing game before (peaceful and fun) Though the first week you can feel like you are waiting around for the infrastructure  of the island to be built before you can let loose with your creativity. If you are a single player it is worth a buy if you like animal crossing games. As a second/Third/Fourth player I cant recomend this game to play if you were intending on sharing an island.\r It feels like an odd choice to make it this way as the trailers and promotional material did not state from what i saw that the second players would miss out on so much of the features it was always mentioning what great multiplayer it would have. Just seems very un-nintendo. I can only hope that they change the way the game is saved so that each profile has their own save/island i would even maybe be a little less salty if it was cartridge locked so me and my partner could each have our own AC cartridge on the same switch but if we wanted our own islands now we would need to buy another switch making this seem like nintendo knew what they were doing hoping people would buy a second switch.","I'm sure this is a great game for my daughter, who is the resident representative. She was the most excited, so we let her play first. I spent several hours trying to figure out what the point of the game was, only to discover that since I'm not the resident, there's not a point. Didn't realize in buying this game for our family that only one of us would have a real game experience. Very disappointed.","I can't even play it, the person I share a switch with wants to have their own island, so I am unable to play the game at all because of a bad design decision by nintendo that was not at all necessary. They offered to buy the game because I do not have much of a disposable income right now. Neither of us knew about the limitation of 1 island per switch before they purchased the game. Since they bought it, I am obviously not arguing with them about it, but it blows. I've been looking forward to the game for over a year,and now it will probably be at least another year until I can play it.","Looking at the GAME (leaving the 1 island per console thing out of it), it is possibly one of the best games to come out on switch and a must have. It has so much to do and lots of addicting activities that have you coming back for more. Just be sure to look at some tips, you\u201dll end up discover something new everyday!","One island per switch are you stupid, when did you think that it was a good idea nintendo ?","The individual mode is perfect, a traditional animal crossing with more options and things to do.\r But the multiplayer, and the alternative accounts in the same console, are ridiculous, I don't know how this things doesn't impact on the final \"professional\" reviewers score.\rI've been playing in the same console with my girlfriend, I've created the first character, and she doesn't have missions... she has to wait  for my next steps... and in the local multiplayer game, the second character can't do anything, is ridiculous.\r I don't know how this game has this high scores... if it pretends to be a social game, and the social modes are the worse modes of any game so far...\r For me, this game does not aproved.","0 pour l impossibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une \u00eele par compte et pour le \"endgame\" pauvre","Shameless greed to force people into buying multiple switches for the full experience. I thought animal crossing was a game you were allowed to share without being punished for it. I can't play the game without deleting my partners island to progress. When the island rep is in quarantine unable to play, you're unable to progress, unless you want to delete their island, which would be an easy decision, if you were a monster.","Reelement le multijoueur ? UNE ile par SWITCH ? Donc si on perds/casse/vole notre console on doit racheter et la switch et le jeu ? Le mutiplayers c'est quoi ce systeme de merde on est bloqu\u00e9 en 98 il est ou le charme seulement le premi\u00e8re habitant peut s'occuper de la ville ??? C'est fort quand meme. Direction Leboncoin","Absolute trash. One island per console. What happens when the wife and both kids want to do different stuff on their own island on one switch","The fact that its encouraging you to buy another switch is ridiculous, they need all players to be able to get involved in building up your town or else it will be very borong..","It's a game advertised tone multiplayer focused and even more or less calmed worries about local co op. This feels bordering on lying in your marketing. Scummy Nintendo is scummy again. This is why I left Nintendo a long time ago. Nice to know journalists and fanboys are ok with an abusive relationship still.","Just imagine, before you are born, god has told you, you can only live in the same house with your first born brother, everything that you need to do, will be planed by your brother.\rYou are cut out of most decision making. Now, go and live \"your\" unless you wanna find a new mum and be the first born.\rThis is what is like to be second player in this game. The save file restriction for each island per console is just too much.\rI don't think this game need any multiplayer as you can't even share the gaming experience with the people you live the closest.\r Greedy developer, Nintendo, Disgusting","AN:NH is a great game with little quality of life issues for example not being able to craft multiple items and some items can not be stored, but these are just small issues that while annoying they don't ruin what is possibly one of the best games to come out in a long time. So dont let one save per console influence your whole review, yes its annoying but its dosen't mean the game is a zero","I have loved every minute of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The graphics of the game are beautiful, and the attention to detail is amazing. The possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless, and the pro design feature helps your character feel like... you. Decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you\u2019re building a community from the ground up, and that\u2019s an amazing feeling to have when you\u2019re playing a game like this. New Horizons\u2019 gameplay is therapeutic, and you can sink hours into the game without even realizing it. The islanders are all unique, and having all of these different personalities is part of what makes this game so immersive. Even the crafting feature, which I wasn\u2019t so excited for before release, is such a great feature to the game. The museum looks beautiful, especially the fish exhibit. The Nook Miles system is also a great addition to the franchise as an exciting new way to get new islanders to come to your island. Overall, the single-player experience is a must-play for anyone who owns a switch. Now, on to the multiplayer. I have to say, some people who have been reviewing this game aren\u2019t the sharpest tools in the shed. You can\u2019t be mad when you realize that there\u2019s only one island per switch after it was advertised to you. The online multiplayer was amazing from my experience, as you can get your friends to come see your island, and you can go see theirs. This adds to the feeling of community you get from spending countless hours on this game. I\u2019d easily give this game a 10/10.","I am extremely angry on how nintendo decided to deal with multiplayer. Honestly, I would probably rate this at least 4 stars... IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY. My sister bought the family's nintendo switch, so she always gets first pick on what to play and who gets to play. She also bought our copy of New horizons. I was very excited to play, as I had New Leaf but got it when i was young and wasn't really trying to progress. When she got back, she had played for about the rest of the day. I asked if I could play, and she told me that you can only have 1 ISLAND PER SWITCH. That is so dumb to me and I don't see any other point of Nintendo doing that other then to lure you into buying a new switch console. I still played with her though, and the leader thing is also so dumb. If you're not gonna let everyone have their own experience, at least let us all talk to people and actually be able to go around. I am definitely not buying a $300 console just to play animal crossing, so i really hope they change this. It's obvious that they are doug it for greed, and I would HAPPILY buy another $60 game to have my own island. But that wound work either. So good job Nintendo, I CANT be the only one who is enraged by this. I'm not going to buy into your greed and get another console. Hopefully this helps anyone looking to buy the game that was advertised as a \"family\" game,  and i hope you rethink and try not to give greedy nintendo money for this terrible idea :)","Not a Family Games, One Island for all, it's a shame for Nintendo.\rWith a large family this is a huge frustation for children's meals. Disappointed","Wow, what an overrated POS game. I have played ALL the Animal Crossing games. People are treating this AC like it's something brand new and \"fresh\" when it's again, literally the same game they've been making since the N64 version and then the ported Gamecube version.\rIn fact, this game is WORSE than the previous iterations - there's no Gyroids, for example! - and you can't have a second player come on to your island and be treated the same exact way as you would. What were they thinking?\r I just don't understand why everyone's treating this game like it's something amazing - where were you people when AC came out on Gamecube? Oh not even born yet? How about DS? How about 3DS? Wii? For all the cool things this game has (mostly small improvements to UI and custom designs), it's a HUGE step backward. I'm done with the AC franchise for good.\r Stop making the same game and saying it's different, Nintendo!!!","Would not recommend for multiplayer! I want to love this game but as a second player I haven't been able to really participate and haven't even gotten all the basic DIY recipes the main player gets (like a bed and things later on, not the tools which I finally figured out you could buy). Probably an amazing game if you're only one player but not having your own island OR recipes just makes being a second player very unfulfilling.","It **** sucks because I got stung 5 times by wasps within the span of an hour","0 Points are way to Good. My girlfriend was so happy to play that Game. We don\u2018t want to buy a second Switch so it is impossible to play this Game for us:-S if they doesn\u2018t fix it we will sell this usless Game. Sorry Nintendo thats the worst decision you had made ever.","Me and my wife have not spent so much time playing games together well next to each other as we both work on our own islands occasionally flying to each other's islands to deliver unique items or bells to help each other advance faster while getting to design our own islands. We plan on having profiles on each switch but just haven't gotten around to it as there is just so much to do!! Definitely need your own switch to play. This is the best animal crossing game to date or it would be it it had say a couple of n64 games running on a in game emulator.","El mejor Animal Crossing q se ha hecho a la larga,si Nintendo le mete m\u00e1s actualizaciones ser\u00eda un juego de 10","Besides the fact that this game is really good, there's something I need to talk about. Don't trust any reviews for this game. It's honestly pathetic how this review bombing is turning out. If you take a look at hundreds of 0 reviews you'll find their logic extremely flawed. And most of all, I noticed a common pattern between these reviewers. It always starts out with \"My wife/kid/friend wanted to play the game too, but you can only have one island per switch! I thought this game was good until I realized this! KEYWORD: GOOD. Look, I'm sure there's plenty of legitimate reasons why someone would want to rate this game a 0/10 but this is just petty. Most of these people were enjoying the game OR think the game is good, and yet they give the game a whopping ZERO because their wife can't play! Nintendo CLEARLY stated the game would only have one island per switch, and these people are acting so surprised that their wives/friends/kids can't have a different island.  One feature (and not a big one at that, multiplayer isn't essential to the game) shouldn't affect the entire score of the game. These people would at least give it a 2 or a 3 if they were taking this seriously. I'm not trying to act like a fanboy here but this is just getting out of hand. If you don't believe me just look at all of these reviews. This is why nobody respects the gaming community. I'm giving this game a 10/10 because I'm trying to combat all of these unfair reviews. I respect honest reviews, even if they were giving the game a 0/10.","First time back to animal crossing since wild world! Although I can think of a few things that could increase the quality of life I think it\u2019s amazing and over the last 7 days since launch I have spent most of each day on my island.","It such a good game, it's a must buy it looks so good most likely the best looking game on switch rn, Would recommend! Also the one island thing was shown in the ACNH Direct so before you buy a game you should of saw the direct before buying to learn about it.","I absolutely loved New Leaf, and being able to experience an animal crossing game again, this time in HD is amazing to me. The game looks, sounds, and plays amazing. The addition of crafting recipes gives something for Collectors to, you know, collect. Many novelty items are great for Recliners to kick back and relax. Stylists now have the ability to choose exactly where their villagers move in and can change their location later, as well as being able to terraform.However, the fact that you can only have one island per system and the absence of many fan favorite items, bring my score down from a 10/10 to a 9/10.","So much fun playing this game on my brother's switch. Don't understand the hate it gets, I'm player 2 on the island and enjoy it just as much as my brother.","to be honest, this is really a good game for a single person since I don't have anyone in my family to play it is really a nice experience","It\u2019s been great being able to play this lately with everything being closed and nothing else to do.","Can't stop playing! ","Amazing experience. This is the closest we can get to animal crossing perfection.","This is a great game - for the first person on a switch playing it. For everyone else, like my little niece who has the second account on her brothers\u2019 switch, it\u2019s an exercise in second class citizenship. She can\u2019t build bridges, can\u2019t build inclines, and can\u2019t even build beds. The fact that a little girl can\u2019t have the same experience in a game as her bigger brother makes me pretty disappointed in this game. What kind of message is this sending?","I've been playing this game for days, and I enjoy it a lot. I'd go as far to say it's one of my favorite games on the Switch since i\"m so nostalgic for this series and just how much content there is. But, since I've been playing this with my whole family. We all realized we can't do anything until my Mom signs in to do whatever she needs to do. This just includes talking to Tom Nook to progress the game. Something that I CAN'T DO. And, the local multiplayer is wildly disappointing as well, It's even more limiting than no co-op lol. If they just added splitscreen that'd do wonders for the co-op experience. This is ridiculous Nintendo, I was happy with the game until it was all soiled just by some basic mechanics in it. This game would be saved if they just gave it a quick patch where you can give representative permissions, or change the island representative. I really want to enjoy this game since I've been waiting so long for it. I really hope this gets changed quick and resolved so me and my family can enjoy the game properly. Nintendo, please fix this so everyone with one switch and multiple people can actually enjoy this game for what it is.","This was gonna be the first animal crossing I played....until I found out you are limited to one island per switch, I dont wanna play on someone else's island i want my own","\"I love the game but, I can't ignore a single feature of the game so it's a 0/10\"\r F u, for making review sites like this useless and forcing me to give a 10 to a game that would be a 7 or a 8 due to that issue.  Put your review bombs up yours.","Lovely game, but need to buy a second switch and second game to share this with my wife? 1 star until fixed.","If you are the only player or the first player to boot up the game, you will enjoy a polished lonely island experience with crafting and cute characters. But if you share your game...everyone who is not player one does not get the same experience. No progress, in couch coop you are simply joining player one, but you dont even have an inventory...","A BIG 0, like many other users for the multisave problem. I bought the game for my sister, hoping i could play with her, but I just can't bring myself to just play literally half of the game (And force her to play half of it, even if it was a gift), which I bought 60$ because of a feature it should have.\r For anyone that was going to review positively this game, even if you are not affected by this problem, I ask of you to be considerate for the other part of the players that can't fully enjoy the game and lower your score.","The game itself is pretty nice. But its one-island per switch system is just stupid. I let my roommate get his animal crossing account first because he seemed really excited for the game. However, now my switch is tied down to his account, and I can't play on my own island. Quite a big issue for me because I will be graduating soon and will have to take my switch. Then will all his progress become mine? It is quite disgusting how Nintendo is making people who want more islands to purchase another switch. Quite greedy and I hope they fix this issue soon as I have two copies on my switch, but won't start my second copy as you can't create your own game.","I am second player on the console ... means like i am only a Player Guided Character having the same options as NPCs ... oh wait no, they have more options as i am. Nice! I love to be an NPC and only running around and doing nothing!First player on the Island has normal game, and can make EVERY descission, i can do nothing of these! No house building, na gifts for me, no progress! Lovely!","I love this game but cannot with good conscience give it a great score. The one island per switch decision stinks of corporate greed. If you\u2019re going to limit the island at least do it per game copy. So people are encouraged to buy copies of the game, but as it stands this is just terrible consumer practices.","1 island per console breaks the game. The switch is supposed to be a home console shared by the household. This is a terrible experience. No one should have to spend another $300 on an additional switch to enjoy the game to its fullest with a partner/friend. Boo Nintendo. Boooooo.","Being the second player of the console is the worst. Not enjoying at all the game","Really disappointed with the one island per console rule. Was going to play with my brothers and were shocked to see this","My sister is sad because she can't make any decisions on her own, she feels like she wasted 60 dollars and doesnt have 300 + 200 for a tv to play with her own townGame is great but ended up wasted 60 dollars during a time when money would be great. :/","Like many others happened to be the second play booting into an island. Honestly sucks because it SEEMED like a fun game and i see that this decision for the shared island is causing alot people to be discouraged from playing this or even the next one","The one island one switch deal makes this game basically unplayable if there are more then one person playing on the same switch. Me and my girlfriend have shared a switch for 2 years without any issue, but now we would need to buy a second switch just so we both get a decent experience?  There a so many better ways they could have implemented this. This is just s***ty. I know people who are out right not even buying the game because of this.","They need to update the game to allow any player sharing the island to advance the game. My wife should be able to play as long as she wants and not have to wait for me to find the time to grind resources so she can keep going. Also, why in the world can't we just go to sleep to advance the game's clock. It's so impracticle and annoying to have to constantly exit the game and change the time in our switch's settings whenever we run out of stuff to do. I'd much rather have the game have it's own timer rather than follow real world time.","Comence a jugar 1 semana despues que mi novio y al entrar la isla se compartia, no me permitio el juego disfrutar por completo porque ya habian muchas cosas avanzadas y yo no puedo continuar en la historia!!! Me gusto el.juego pero no hay progreso. Su multijugador esta muy limitado y yo no puedo crear mi propia isla.","With the whole one island per switch thing it was bound to ruin the game for me or my sister and I happened to have the butt end.","Player 2 limitations ruin the entire experience, definitely regret buying this one","I own the Nintendo Switch in our house but bought the game for my girlfriend to play. I also want to play this game but realised very quickly that my Animal Crossing experience was stunted, as my island was a carbon copy of my girlfriend's island that she'd been working on for the past week. All the major decisions so far in the game have already been made for me and I literally do not have the power to do any more.\rI can't help but think it would've been easier for the game devs to make it so we had our own individual islands in the first place instead of implementing this stupid shared island feature that literally no one asked for. At this point in time it's impossible for me to play this game.","I bought the game and I share my Switch with my brother. I let him start the game and when I was about to play I realized I could only play on his island and do basically nothing. I bought the game AND the console and I can't actually play the game.\r So, only solution is to kindly ask my brother to delete all his save for me to really be able to play the game, he's been playing for several days so I understand it can also be frustrating for him.\r Not having in consideration this HUGE issue, the game seems quite nice and enjoyable, but I find it really too important to just let it pass. That's why I give this low rate. I really expect Nintendo to fix this issue and let different account on the same console to run their own island, if they do so, I will consider remaking this review according to the actual quality of the game itself.","Frankly I\u2019m disappointed in Nintendo. I am new to animal crossing I have no experience with previous games. However all that being said it\u2019s a good game. I has good graphics but it\u2019s lacking on a few points. First one island per switch is insane. I have two sisters, my family can not afford 3 switches so we cannot all play a 60$ game. Next, the game functions in real time in some ways that\u2019s awesome things rely on time of day. But also I am a student who cannot log on all day so I miss certain fish and bugs. With it running in real time it takes real days for jobs to be completed. For example you place the lot for a house after 5am the following morning it will be built. The only real story to the game is improving your house and island. All other aspects are a gathering aspect, as in find resources. When improving your house you don\u2019t get to pick new roof or bigger room it\u2019s a set order each becoming more and more expensive. I understand teaching the player responsibility but playing the game the proper way without exploits (like tarantulas) makes a 2.5 million $/bells loan unrealistic. With loans and things you pick what they are for. I\u2019m also loosing interest because after playing for a week I\u2019m still stuck with an island I cannot customize. I have great plans for what I want but no way to do them. I thought I was buying a game I could sit and play for hours but I don\u2019t see how that is possible when I can\u2019t do anything. I fish and catch bugs with hopes of paying my crazy house loans and for what? Weeks upon weeks before I can do what I desire. Maybe think twice about purchasing it is definitely not worth the hype.","I have 4 kids, 3 of which play this game, with only a single Island per Switch this has become a disappointment among the children. One child has unlocked most of the items on the Island and the other ones were disappointed about that. Whoever is on first gets to collect the resources on the home island for the day. I am disappointed with how the game makers decided to do this when the switch handles profiles so well compared to previous Nintendo products. All other games that my kids have played have also handled profiles and separation of those profiles well also. This is why I feel that this deserves a very low score. I hope they find a fix for this.","I have never played an Animal Crossing game before, but I was really looking forward to this one given the hype and the fact that my partner is a huge fan of the series. However, after purchasing the game for AU$80 I realise I can't actually play this game properly as a non-primary account.\r I'm honestly baffled at this decision by the developers. I mean I'm happy to buy a new copy of the game if it means that I can enjoy the full experience myself, but this is not even an option; I actually have to buy a whole new copy AND a new Switch as well? This move is worse than anything EA has done with its micro-transactions in my opinion. What a way to sell more Switch consoles; it's either genius or disgusting. For those who have money, it's probably the former, but I for one have lost a lot of respect for Nintendo.\r Given that I can't even experience the game for what it really is, and that my Switch console is forever barred from Animal Crossing (unless I delete my partner's save), I have to give this a 0/10.","It really is a bad experience if you share a Nintendo switch with anybody. I    didn't even know tom nook gave quests until my brother told me about all the stuff I was missing. Heavily disappointed and really hoping for just a simple update that utilizes the switch's capability to have multiple save files, like what pokemon did from the leap between 3ds and switch.","No cloud saves. Only one island per Switch. Awful design decisions, and frankly I do not care if it is based on tradition. If people want to cheat/manipulate time then let them. Who cares? They paid for the game. It would not disrupt anyone's experience who wishes to play the game as is intended.\r Not to mention a slap in the face to the customers who are paying for the Nintendo Online service for the cloud save feature.\r It is not fair to expect households to have multiple Switch consoles. Entirely thoughtless decision on Nintendo's part in order to preserve something about the game. Again, who cares? This is not a multiplayer PvP-style game that would be crippled by cheating.","This game has way too much useless dialog. Seriously it is extremely annoying.1. When building the museum the stupid owl runs through 500 words just so you can donate one at a time before opening. 2. When upgrading or moving houses it literally calls inthe box for a useless conversation about moving.3.any interaction with new box is a time sink.4. The game doesn't give you an option to have fasted dialog. 5. You need to go through the dumbest receptive dialog when accessing stores or the nook system.This game is honestly not as seamless as it should be.When placing down trees or buildings you get no indication whether or not it's going to fit. And if it does and its not aligned as you want it you have to re do the dialog to place again. Why is there no outline indication. I really enjoyed the start but as the game progresses and there's more stuff to do. 2 hour useless npc talking and A button smashing is getting annoying. Going to fly in the airport? Yeah wait 1122 years for the stupid dodo to shutup.Wanna craft multiple items? You wish there was a craft X amount. No you need to re do the craft dialog Not seamless. And a game like this needs to be or all you get is frustration. Seriously in a game based around design why can't you get align grids when placing trees or plans. Instead of wasting 50k to relocate to fit. And before evem getting to pay the fee to relocate you need to go thru the same dialog over n over. The developers literally assumed the player base to be 11 year olds mostly.","Pretty good game with a ton of options and things to do in single-player, but getting an error code 2618-0513 every time trying to visit my friend's island is REALLY frustrating. If the patch addressing this issue released - I'm more than happy to change the score.","This game is absolutely amazing with one big huge mistake. I understand the second, third and etc. player maybe shouldn't have a say in the Islands big decisions. I understand where they're coming from considering it could maybe cause progress to go too fast or cause chaos on an island with up to 8 people. But PLEASE, TELL ME WHY THERE ISN'T AN OPTION TO SWITCH PLAYER 1. Many of us made player 1 whitin our family without the commitment of knowing they will have a say in EVERYTHING to come. There should be an option to change that later on without having to delete the island. I'm extremely disappointed that such a well thought-out game didn't think this through.","Nitendo showing all its greed on this one. I am the main account on our Switch with a paid membership and all. Bought this game for the wife and she doesn't have access to a few features of the game because she is not the main user on the console. She has to basically sign up for another paid account making two paid accounts on the same console... you kidding me right? And I can't play and have a totally different island either. It would just be her stuff that she has already done. Pretty trash move by Nitendo.","My brother was first to play on our Switch. While he's far ahead of everyone else (meaning no story blocks for me or my sister) I'm still a little mad that I'm limited to playing on a single island and not my own, on my profile. Other caveats with the multiplayer make it impossible for me to enjoy the game (shown by the fact that when I play I can't even play for more than 10 minutes a day without getting bored) such as the limited daily resources for all players.","A la segunda cuenta no le dan materiales indispensables como es el hacha, haciendo asi la cuenta de tus familiares aburridisima","Why can I not buy a second copy of this game to use on my switch? I think this policy/restriction should be revisited ASAP.","Great game for a single person using a single Switch console. However, other users on the same console are extremely handicapped. Additional console users cannot further the story and advance the island. It requires the primary user to do all of that alone. Honestly, it feels like Nintendo is punishing the customers who only own one copy of the console and game.","I bought this game to play with my wife. I let her make the island and her profile first. Not knowing this would virtually make the game unplayable for me. You can only have one Island on the console. But for me that was not the Maine issue as I wanted to share an island with my wife anyway. But letting her crew the island left me unable to advance the game in any way. I would really like a patch set allows a toggle switch or something that would allow other players to make advancement on the island as well. Basically to get anything out of the game now I would have to buy a second switch and another copy of the game ","I do not understand the decision to limit the number of islands to one on the Switch. If I want to experience the game for myself, my options are to delete my girlfriends island, or go purchase an additional Switch and re-purchase the game? I used to think EA and Blizzard were bad. First time ever purchasing Animal Crossing, and unless fixed, I can guarantee this will be my last. Do the right thing. At least Bungie and Bethesda communicated to their - rightfully - angry fan-bases when their games were broken. Unacceptable. This makes Soldier 76 Fallout look like game of the year. If you plan on playing this game with a live-in partner, don't bother. Absolute waste of money and player-2's time.","Separate islands for each profile should be a given. I'm not buying another switch just to have my own island. I'm also not going to play on my kid's island because it's not my island. This limitation should be in bold print and all caps on the cover of this game so people know what they're walking into. Nintendo will do nothing to address this and as a lifelong Nintendo player it's crazy frustrating. Never looked at Metacritic in my life, but heard this is where to go to vent.","Super beautiful and wonderful game(for one person) same as many ppl, is very frustrating to spend money on a game that allows only one person per gaming console to fully enjoy and access lots of the game. Super simple fix, so hope they can lose a bit of the greed.","This could have been a great game if you simply could create more than one island. My sister got the whole family hyped for this great game without realizing no one could actually take any decisions, we could just follow her lead since we weren\u2019t the first one to play on the device. For a game that prides itself on self-discovery and the freedom to do what you want, there is very little choice. The switch was conceived with groups and families in mind. Why can\u2019t every family member play their own way? Most people don\u2019t have the money to just buy another switch and are now stuck having spent 80$ on a game that not everyone can enjoy the same way. Shameful.","This game is a ridiculous cash grab by the corporate pigs named nintendo, they limit the islands to one per console! Especially in this trying time they are testing people and soon people will realize they are just using them for money! I thought nintendo was better than this, I would expect such behavior out of EA but nintendo is worse than EA because they are costing us $300 dollars minimum each for people who do not own a switch! ($300 is the price of a switch mini and a copy of new horizons.) The only way nintendo can make this up to their customers is to remove the one island per console rule and put out a formal apology. I, myself am sending nintendo a dm daily on my instagram @jaycewornick to remove the one console per island rule and I invite others to do so as well.","You can only have one island per SWITCH. All accounts on one switch must share one island, and so the first player is the only one getting the full experience. This has to be fixed. Many people can't afford to purchase a new switch for everyone who wants to play. I guess Nintendo has just decided to be greedy.","The first player creates an island, names it, and plays.\rThe second player plays on the island of the first player, he does not have his own island.\rProblems between my two daughters.\rI hope Nintendo rectifies this design error.","I've played every Animal Crossing game as they were released, and was ecstatic for New Horizons. The game is beautiful, and you can tell that a lot of work went into the visuals and scenery. Aside from that, I feel like it's lacking even compared to its older predecessors. I was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers, but interactions are very limited and repetitive. The villagers are the staple of Animal Crossing. I was so excited to finally have a game that would have rich, personable interaction, more villager games, etc. Villagers used to host flea markets and visit your house for fun or vice versa. They used to have interactive aerobics and sports fairs. Now they just wander around and do their own thing, but your character doesn't even have the ability to sit down or join them. I can already predict the 3-5 dialogue options I'll hear each day from every villager. It's disappointing. The lack of amenities is also frustrating. When previous games like City Folk and New Leaf had coffee shops, theaters, and other stores, we were expecting more - not expecting everything to be taken away. Now that I've paved and decorated my town, there really isn't anything to do. I can see that they added the Nook Miles system as a way to keep you busy but most of us aren't interested in doing menial tasks for numbers, we wanted more room for interaction with our villagers and island. Once everyone has played for a month or so, they'll be finding that there really isn't anything to do in this game. Unfortunately I'm probably going to end up putting this game down and picking up Wild World or New Leaf unless some updates roll out to change things.","Wonderful game but LET PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH. Pretty ridiculous this wasn't in the game at launch.","I big old **** you to whoever decided I had to share in island with my brother. Unplayable.","I\u2019m not affected by the multiplayer issue, I just dislike the game. Major annoyances are the UI, very slow and annoying load times on things like selling items, entering areas. The load times are terrible. The puns get really old fast and hold up things like selling things or advancing the story.\r Gameplay is repetitive and gets old real quick. It\u2019s just a very boring game. I\u2019ve played for a week and it\u2019s time for me to sell this game on for sure.\r I\u2019m sure the score would be even less if I had to play this in a house with two players.\r I really do not recommend purchasing this game or a switch which has a really low selection of games at a premium price. PC or PS4 are far better value for money. Very disappointed with Nintendo this generation and I\u2019m not very aware of the bias of fans.","Amazing game. It's super addictive, can't wait to give it a 10/10 when they change the 1 island per switch feature.","The games is fun in the beginning but gets boring very quickly. I was very hyped about the game coming out but it has way many shortcomings and glitches. The Easter event going on right now is the nightmare you would be living through!","The fact you can't have multiple islands is just ridiculous and seems like a scheme to sell more switch consoles.","This is the best game in the Animal Crossing series. I would actually give it a 9/10, because it isn't perfect, but I need to balance out all these negative reviews.","The game itself was so fun. The different missions are easy, yet leave you enough room to learn. I enjoyed this game and I\u2019m enjoying adding to my DIY list, with over 250 items on it!!","My GF and I are both huge AC fans. However, only one of us is able to enjoy the game. Anybody after the first resident gets a half baked experience. Multiplayer has too many limitations to enjoy regularly.  Currently we can afford another copy and I'd gladly buy one. However, we can't afford another Switch and with COVID-19 it'll be awhile before we can responsibly afford it. I don't understand Nintendo's decision to have one island per Switch and not per game or profile. It is seen as a family entertainment system and AC cannot entertain a family at the moment. One person per Switch can truly experience the game and that is not okay. Also, there is no reason not to offer cloud back ups. The Switch is a home and portable console. Being portable adds risks. Nobody should have to feel the heartache of losing their console and their hours of hard work. The game is awesome and I will gladly raise my score once Nintendo gets with modern times and fixes these archaic limitations.","The game itself is amazing but the fact that only one island is allowed per switch ruins the game for me.","Only the first player is the one who can keep unlocking things in the game.  secondary players can only get resources and depend on the first.  Furthermore, it does not allow you to have one island per player.  At home we were disappointed in this, since I depend on the first player, a shame.","Limiting the game to one island per Switch is a inexcusable greedy anti consumer move.","Bought this game for two young kids to play, only to find out too late that they have to share the same island. Perhaps Nintendo have never met siblings who are not great at sharing. Perhaps they think all sisters get along all the time and never get angry with the other for TOUCHING THEIR STUFF. It would be lovely to imagine that was true. But they must have known the problems it would cause and did it anyway. So, 1 out of 10 from me for such a cynical and greedy decision","Very disappointed in the game play of this for people sharing the switch. It is unreal to expect people to purchase multiple switch consoles in order to have the same experience. To be clear, I am fine with sharing an island. That's the way it's always been. What's ridiculous is the lack of abilities that the non-resident representatives have to deal with. It wouldn't have been difficult to allow all players to terraform, build bridges, etc. And to progress the story. If they wanted to make people share they should have made everyone able to experience the full game. Honestly not worth the money for families hoping to play together","I could get over having to share an island but if you aren\u2019t the first player, you are screwed.You can\u2019t do anything. I can\u2019t contribute materials to building projects.Can\u2019t access tons of recipes to build items.Can\u2019t choose where to build things.You get ignored by the townsfolk.......Basically all you can do is chop wood and stone to give to the main character so that when they decide to play, they can turn them in to upgrade the town......I CANT EVEN SEE WHAT THEY NEED!!!! They have to verbally tell me!!!!!Fix this ASAP!!","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an exceptional game that will keep you playing again and again for years!\r + Most in-depth Animal Crossing yet with greatly expanded crafting system;\r+ Relaxing experience that will make you love the game more and more;\r+ Nintendo updates and fixes the game as soon as possible if a bug is discovered;\r+ The game gives you the freedom to play exactly how you want;\r+ The community is friendly and helpful;\r+ The pinnacle of escapism;\r+ Each villager has their own personality;\r The game requires a fair amount of involvement to get the best from it, but it rewards you for your efforts. What more can I say? The game is meant to be enjoyed. Take your time and have fun!","It's ridiculous that it's 1 island per switch, Nintendo might not engage in many microtransactions in their games, but they still scam gamers in other ways that are forgiven, such as mutiple pokemon games that are nearly identical, and things like this, **** this system and **** nintendo","Don\u2019t buy unless you will be the only regular player. One person gets to experience the game and anyone after the first has to be a pointless player in the originals island. You can\u2019t contribute anything. I bought it and was the first player, but my brother went in to play later and when we realized this I had him delete my island so he could play. I don\u2019t really plan on touching it because that was super frustrating to happen and it seems entirely pointless for the developer to have done. Maybe if they fix it I\u2019ll create my own island but for now I don\u2019t even really have a game I payed $60 for.","This is easily a contender for best Animal Crossing game. It brings everything you've loved about the series since it's beginnings, and adds even more content (with more to come). The only cons to this game are 1. a few quality of life changes they could make, as with the other games in the series, and 2. Only one island per console, which is the only reason this game has such a bad user score. This is definitely a game to pick up and sink hundreds of hours into during this time of self isolation.","My issue with the game is that the controls are overly sensitive in that if you\u2019re one pixel off the fish won\u2019t see the line and if you are digging a hole or wanting to plant something the odds of it being where you want is about 40%. It\u2019s also too easy to undo something that you wanted because the controls are so sensitive/picky. If you had an update with the options of simpler controls and interactions similar to Pocket Camp, the game would be much more relaxing and enjoyable. The other issue is the mystery island AI, there should be a quiz or something at the beginning of the game that is focused on which villager type or style you like because I (and probably many others) have wasted over 20 Nook Miles Tickets and over 40,000 Nook Miles trying to find the villager I want or at least a decent villager to invite. Or the least you could do is make Nook Miles tickets cheaper, or have them be purchasable with bells, because at a certain point it\u2019s hard to get enough Nook Miles. Or there at least has to be a way to invite a villager other than buying an amiibo card. It frustrated me so much that I just reset and deleted the game and it will probably take me 2 more weeks of quarantine to be bored enough to try again.","I love this game. Love it.. but as previously stated by hundreds of people, not being the main island representative sucks. When you go on the Nintendo support page, they just state that another Switch needs to be purchased for someone to have their own island. I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but right now, especially during this period of quarantine, I don\u2019t have a damn dime to spare. I don\u2019t have cash to just throw at another Switch. For us new AC players, this has been a major wake up call. So frustrating.","The game is great apart from a massive design flaw of not allowing multiple islands. This would be a 9 or 10 with this feature. This is literally tearing the community apart and should be available. Needing to buy a NEW CONSOLE to have another island is beyond the reach of 90% of players and families. Whoever thought that this would just work most likely doesn't have children as each would like to have their own island and own experience of the game. This should be a call to the devs to make this change as soon as they possibly can with the virus taken into account.","I don't care that you get one island per Switch. That seems like a design choice that allows families to play together. What is ridiculous is that the 2nd person to play the game cannot advance without the 1st person to play doing so first.  I didn't realize this mechanic until about 10 hours in, so now we have to start from scratch.  Why isn't there an option to just switch the Resident Representative??","Either allow more islands per console or allow all players on the single Island to have equal rights and and resposibilities to contribute to all aspects of Island life.  Failing these options, there should at the very least be some way for the citizen representative pass there role to another player.  Shocking design choice for a game advertised as multiplayer in the year 2020.","No tiene sentido que dos personas no puedan tener cada uno su propia isla. Muy decepcionado la verdad","Nintendo worst company ever. You don't care about customers, but you are nothing without us. Once island per switch, shame on you !!!","Do not buy this game if you are looking to share it with someone; only the player who started the game is able to progress the story and develop the island. The majority of the new and interesting features shown in gameplay trailers will be unavailable to other players. These unnecessary restrictions ruin an otherwise enjoyable game.","If you have more than 1 person using the game, it's worthless. Until they fix player 2 story line, don't get the game. I'm done with nintendo unless they fix this. Huge waste of money.","Me and my wife got it pre-ordered. We were super excited to start playing it and actually share the one-console island. The excitement lasted until limitations kicked in. The non-representative player can be described as a visitor with few privileges. Your progress is limited by player 1 and you cannot move buildings, build bridges, reserve lots for new residents, demolish bridges, upgrade shops... Basically what you can do is sit and watch player one have fun. We have no problem with shared resources as other players have experienced (which I believe may be a problem depending on whom you share your island), but not being able to shape and modify the island I'm a resident, just sucks. I've played roughly 60h by now and this will be probably it. There is just nothing fun to do anymore.","I bought this game so me and my family could play it. I started it, then handed it to my sister, who can't start her own island due to Nintendo changing the way saves are done for this game. Instead of treating each profile on the switch like their own save file (like every other game on the switch does), they treat the entire system as one big save file. Which makes the game completely unfair to anyone else. Now my sister is waiting, hoping that Nintendo changes this god awful feature. As she is depressed over the virus, and I fear for her life if she doesn't have something to hope forue to the virus, we are loosing jobs, so we can't afford another system. Not that we want another system anyway. Nintendo has lost a life long customer due to the amount of selfish, crazy decisions they have made within the past two years.","The multi user feature has ruined the game. Another user has started a game on the Switch and now as a second user I cannot access simple tools leaving me nothing to do. Very poor  , a waste of money","its okay. Multi-player is awful. The game only progresses as far as player one progresses","Nintendo, I've been a fan of your products ever since i was a small boy, and when we purchased Animal Crossing, me and my brother thought we can have our own islands, but nope you guys restricted it to one island a switch, and restricts the other players from having the same experience. It content lock the second player to what ever the first player was able to accomplish, this ruins the fun and makes the game boring, so we are returning the game. All of this to push on people buying a new switch, its a stupid reason. This ruined the experience so much.","8 years for this.. dont get me wrong it's cute and a bit fun but this game feels dry. Online play is useless to. Besides being cute online what's the point of opening my door lol","I created an account on metacritic just to post this review.  The limit of one island per console is utterly ridiculous.  Was there no thought put into this by Nintendo?  My 9 year old daughter was the first to play this game and as one can expect, the island is littered with items with no thought to building a \"perfect\" little world.  This is great for her, she enjoys herself... but the rest of the members in my household have to suffer.  We cannot contribute anything to her island and we are unable to create islands ourselves to build OUR visions of the perfect utopia.  This needs to be fixed immediately as only one person can truly enjoy this game per console!  Please at least make it one island per account/user on the Switch!","Why only one island per console. We share switch at home and I cannot play my own game since the only the first user to start game will own its own island. Great Nintendo!","The one island is absolutely unacceptable. Why could they not give multiple saves? Why do I have to share my resources if I want to play with someone else? It makes no sense, and it\u2019s ruining the game for me. Also having to wait for specific parts of the day. I work and I\u2019m very busy more often than not, and the time sensitive specs are enraging when you compare it to the original Animal crossing where you would just go to sleep. I recommend you just play the original on the GameCube then delve into this game","To clarify, if your a single person with a single switch then this game is a 10/10 from just about every aspect except ethically. If your a couple or family with one switch then feel free to continue reading.This was my wife and I\u2019s first entry into the Animal Crossing series. We have 1 Switch for our household ( yea you already know where this is going ), and I have to say I\u2019m more than bummed that the game treats every other profile other than the first to boot up the game as an obvious player 2. Fact is, this game doesn\u2019t work as it is on a multi user Switch.I get the reason behind this both from a consumer and business point of view however, that doesn\u2019t excuse what a blatant attempt this is to push more Switch consoles out. And frankly this makes no sense, in fact it goes against their online subscription business model where you can either buy for an individual or family (8). Clearly one console is designed to be used by many users so why aren\u2019t the save features of this first party title. This review comes from 2 people with 1 switch. As the game can only be enjoyed fully by one of us and is useless to the other, it gets a 5/10. Great job Nintendo on successfully torpedoing this clearly entry level game into the series for new players.","The fact that you can only have one island per switch console is a huge downer. I wanted to play the game independantly from my family (because I'm a mega sweat player) But I cannot, because whoever played the game first is basically \"lord supreme dictator\" of the island.\rI will happily revise my review upon further changes. But my experience with the game feels like something out of a pay-to-win mobile game...\r Regards.","Awfull nintendo game and the one island policy is a shame.\rDon't buy this game if u plan to play as a familly don't ! it's just a problems maker.\rThe happy familly theme is just a front.\rThe marketing is a  real disgrace.\rMoney makers gonne too far once again.\rRefund will be on his way.","The fact that I would have to buy a second switch to get the same game experience as my wife is **** I could accept having to buy a separate copy of the game, but a second console? Completely unacceptable.","Is my entire family supposed to buy one Switch each to play this game? This is literally insane and should be illegal. Shame on you Nintendo, wish I could return my Switch, never buying a product from you again.","Bought this game for my gf, bored and try to play it myself - see that Nintendo added an arbitrary restriction of one island per console. This is blatant anti-consumerism and is an obvious cash grab to sell more consoles. Nintendo has lost a customer, I will never again give a cent to this company that couldn\u2019t even respect me as a consumer.","For a game that's about making friends and togetherness, the game isolates everyone besides the primary player. No one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses, why? It would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn't. Exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only be done so many times before I get burnt out. Decorating can only get me so far and from what I've heard there are apparently not many furniture options to decorate with. I want to build a town and see new faces besides the two villagers my wife and I first started out with but I can't do anything, there's no point in being a secondary player in this Animal Crossing. If the secondary player chops trees or mines rocks it renders those resources empty for other players for a while, taking away their resources. Besides that, another huge issue I have with the game is optimization issues. Why do I have to eat one orange at a time? Why not give an option to eat a certain number of food items at one time without having to click over and over again and give it a slightly longer animation? The same thing happens with releasing fish; you need to go into your pockets, click on the fish, click release. This for some reason takes you out of the menu to play the same tired animation. Chances are you have more than one thing you want to drop to empty out your limited inventory so you end up going into your inventory several times and it takes way longer than it should. This game does everything in its power to waste your time like clicking through dozens of text boxes to donate anything for instance. It is such bad design that it makes me not want to play it anymore and it wouldn't matter since secondary players don't matter anyway.","I'm playing with my wife and as she is the primary player, I lost the interest in game on the third day. I don't want to play it as there is absolutely nothing to do, than fishing and expanding the house. Any other catchy moments are just spent by the primary player.\rMakes 0 point to play it together.\rAnd it's a shame Nintendo you pushing  to buy the second console in that dirty way. It's a cheap move.","I thought I would like this game as I am a very big fan of Stardew Valley which has a lot of similar elements to Animal Crossing. The problem I ran into over and over while playing this was how strikingly tedious, dull, and repetitive everything is - and for very little payoff","My girlfriend and I was looking forward to have our own Islands and help eachother out.... 1 Island per switch is absolute **** luckily I told a lot of people about this and they passed om the game. **** off Nintendo.","Extremely disappointed by the multi-player experience.\rAs a young adult, I played the Gamecube Animal Crossing with my family.  We all had a great time.  It's been so long that I can't remember all the game mechanics, but it seemed to me that everyone contributed and had a great time playing the game.  My dad, the 3rd person to start playing, earned the gold statue.\rFast forward to 2020 - now I'm a dad and I was on the fence about buying a Switch since I've collected quite a few consoles over the years.  I was interested in some of the Nintendo exclusive titles, but when I saw there was going to be an Animal Crossing game on the Switch, I was sold.  Bought the Switch and pre-ordered AC:NH.  Even purchased a Nintendo online subscription to play with remote friends.\rI kept thinking of how much fun I had playing the Gamecube version, and imagined doing the same with my young daughters and wife.  I really talked it up with them, the fond memories of building a home, seeing K.K. play at the train station.. how we all got statues towards the end of the game.. how much fun it was to play - playing together.\rGame arrived, and since my older daughter had been good, let her fire it up and make her villager first (a mistake).\rThings seemed fine, but then.. after a few days I couldn't figure out how to make a shovel.  Or an axe..  seemed odd.  I had paid off my tent loan, had Nook miles+.. bought DIY recipes for a shovel.. axe.. but those required a flimsy axe or flimsy shovel to craft.  I was quite confused.  After Googling.. I was in complete disbelief over what Nintendo had sold me.\rI fully expected us to share 1 island.  That's how it was on the Gamecube (although you could probably make multiple saves on multiple cards).  I think I would have been disappointed had it NOT been 1 island.  That's sort of the point, playing together, a community.. common good and all that.  Seeing your co-players houses, what they've planted, what's new at the museum etc.\rAC:NH is a huge disappointment to me.  It's been stated a million times, but only the 1st player - the resident representative - gets a real game.  Everyone else is extremely limited in what they can do.\rSo much a disappointment, I may just track down a copy of the Gamecube game and hope it holds up.","Really good game but the  beginning is kinda boring I have played it for three days so far","Nintendo almost made the perfect cozy game, but the extreme limitations put on the second player, and requirement to purchase an entire second console if you want to have two players play on equal footing makes the game unplayable if you don't have a switch for every person in your home who wants to play.","Honestly, who thought it was a good idea to make one island per switch? Who sat there and said yea that's a great idea people will love that. Its not even like they tried to even make it so the other profiles on the switch can play. You can do literally close to nothing and are stuck living like a literal bum in a tent on whoever's island the main profile belongs to. Truly a garbage way to make a game Nintendo, there goes another one of your sales.","This game is absolute garbage.  Did nobody think that multiple people in a household might share a home console? Absolute game-breaking poor design. Worthless.","Hate to be part of review bombing but I think it's the only way to have attention brought to this.\r It's one thing to limit everyone to one island...the island is large enough that if people don't want to live near each other they can stay apart.  But the current system in which the island's progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is is absolutely ridiculous.  There's no need for it in my eyes, I can't see any reason why it should have to be this way; I don't want to be cynical of nintendo, but it honestly feels like a move to sell more systems--simply because I can't fathom any other reason that would be necessary.\r Personally speaking as a player 2 on the island, it feels like I have no point in playing.  I don't get assignments from Tom Nook, which means I don't get any recipes like my P1 does; I also don't get to invite citizens to the island, or plan infrastructure, or make any decisions.  Basically I'm playing home decorator 2020, because I can't contribute anything to the island aside from paying money towards bridges/stairs and throwing some furniture outside.\r Hopefully the devs catch wind of the review bombing and seek to patch this out sooner rather than later.  Again, being on one island is fine, but having no options to contribute as player 2 is ridiculous.  Its as simple as giving P2+ the options to change infrastructure and invite settlers; and if you're worried about doubling-up missions, just have Tom Nook announce that someone else is working on an assignment for him already, and then have him lay out what the assignment is and give the recipes needed for the other players to help.","I am the second player (my wife is first) and I can't properly play to the game if she doesn't do stuff before me. I'll change my rating when this gets fixed.","I have 18 hours into the game and can\u2019t progress because I was not the first person on it in my household.  I can\u2019t transfer the representative position too.  I will fix my rating once they fix this issue!  It is unreal how in this day and age this is a problem.","It\u2019s a shame only player one has al the fun. Played a lot together now it is a waiting game","this game is really disappointing. a lot of missed opportunities, especially with the local co op. bought this to play with my wife and super disappointing that the 2nd player cannot do anything to help progress the game just because i played first. this needs to be fixed.","I was so excited for this game and now I hate it, I didn't know one design decision could make me so upset with Nintendo and the animal crossing franchise. The switch was advertised as a family console with great multiplayer options, much the same the new animal crossing was also marketed with great family experience. However, seems to me that the only people who are enjoying this game are the ones who own one switch per person. I could almost get on board with sharing an island but other players outside the primary get a **** version of what should be a good game, with little to no participation in the story line and island creation. This is a ruthless and greedy scheme by Nintendo to force people to buy multiple devices (family marketed devices not solo marketed devices), makes me disgusted and I no longer want to support Nintendo.","I got this game for my wife an I to play during quarantine and was heartbroken to see that only player 1 can progress in the story. I liked sharing an island, but why can\u2019t we both work on completing objectives?? Such a disappointment..","Had I known that only one person could make changes and be in control of the island I would not have bought this game for my family of 4. Not only do my wife and I have to share an island my two children have to share as well. We all have to agree on where things go and what gets completed. This takes out all of the fun of being in control of your own island and designing it the way you'd like. Very unhappy about this choice.","I wanted to buy this game but the fact that we cant share the same console with other users and have to buy a new switch for every user is stupid and its makes it too complicated for me to get this game. Im not rich. I wont buy another switch just for one game and i dont want my girlfriend to be player 2 and have no power in the game just because im the player 1 for example. This is very stupid. I will not buy it and its very disapointing.","Well done Nintendo. You got my money, and now I just have to wait until my girlfriend dies or leaves me to start my own game on my own island. You guys make Tom Nook look like Robin Hood.","So people say this game is so nice, beautiful, etc. My game saves broke. Out of nowhere. randomly. Who cares if the is beautiful if you can't even keep your own save from breaking? I've lost so much progress. Shame on you Nintendo. Shame. This could've been fixed and prevented with the cloud saving. There is no excuse for no cloud saving. And my save breaking is a prime example of why there should be a cloud service. The emergency save recovery should've been available at launch. No excuses considering they also delayed the game for nearly a year. It's baffling to see how much Nintendo actually cares about its consumers. Shame on Nintendo. SHAME.","Amazing game. Haven\u2019t stopped playing it since I bought it. A lot people complaining about the island representative not being shared is kind of understandable, but it\u2019s definitely not worth rating the game 1 or 0 stars. Sure \u201cyour\u201d user doesn\u2019t have 100% control on the island at the moment but there are ways around this. You can just ask firstly, haha, or you can log in as their user and do the things necessary. Idk I\u2019m sure there are other ways around this. My gf just grabs an extra controller and calls my in game char in, swaps leader and plays as my char if she really wants do something. Think outside of the box people!","This game is awful. For So. Many. Reasons. Multiplayer is a nightmare - no matter if you're playing locally or online. Online - oh god - that's a mess. Over and over again, people can leave your island by disconnecting or just quitting - which results in you losing anything that you've done or received. That 100k or cool recipe you just got? POOF! It's gone. Congrats. And the one island-per-switch choice is moronic. If you are a parent thinking you can get this and enjoy playing with your kids but having your own island - you're SOL.\r But if you want, I can still come visit your islan- hold on a second. The game needs to pause every time someone leaves or enters your island. So if you just got some killer turnip prices or a meteor shower and want to make some money from people visiting...um, good luck with that. It's fantastic gameplay, lemme tell you.\r However, what makes this game so bad goes far, far beyond that. You get a dialog popup for. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. THAT. YOU. DO. Caught that same fish for the 100th time? Let me give you a dialog box! Want to visit another island? Here's 10 dialog boxes for you! Want to craft an item? Here's 5 dialog boxes for each item you want to craft! Did you close that dialog box? Here's another one for closing it. So much time is spent on stupid aspects of the game that are simply - dumb - design decisions.\r By the way, you'll be crafting each item individually as there's no bulk crafting. Fishing is annoying as the timing of when fish change directions is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for each cast. NMT islands get boring incredibly fast. This game repeatedly feels like a free-to-play game because at multiple points, you cannot progress until a day passes.\r I've played life sim games like this. At this point, I'm wholly recommending you play Stardew over this game. It's cheaper too, and the dev will straight up respond to your suggestions or bug reports on Twitter. The sad thing is ALL of these issues are just dumb design choices that could be fixed easily with a patch. The QA team should be fired for how bad this game feels at times.","I do love this game, very much, but there are a LOT of clunky things that I\u2019m disappointed to see. Considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console, I won\u2019t cover that (and it wasn\u2019t an issue for me, as I\u2019m the only person who uses my Switch). However, I have a lot of other disappointments. I won\u2019t go over the things I love because the critics covered it all\u2014everything they said is definitely true. This is by far the best Animal Crossing yet, despite the huge flaws. I\u2019m very disappointed to see that there\u2019s no way to access your storage outside of your home. The storage is much better than before, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014you can store much more, and the game auto-sorts your stuff for you. Character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever. But when you add crafting, several things need to be changed. Even in previous games, you could access your storage through either the post office or train station. Considering you can place items which used to link to your storage (dressers, chests, etc) out in your island now, why can\u2019t you use those to access storage? I know this wouldn\u2019t be \u201crealistic,\u201d but Animal Crossing isn\u2019t exactly about realism. The multiplayer is clunky as hell, too. Connection has been pretty bad every time I play, and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is AWFUL. If you want to play with more than one friend at once, you\u2019re out of luck. Not to mention that if someone tries to leave, and others don\u2019t \u201cclose their windows\u201d (aka, menus or conversations), a ten second timer will tick down. If it hits 0, the person trying to leave will go home with an error code and lose EVERYTHING they did while on the island, as well as everyone else losing what they got while interacting with the player. This is absolutely horrendous and makes no sense to me. Players can essentially sabotage others if they want to using this. Also, the restrictions on what you can do while others are over is annoying. Why can\u2019t I rearrange furniture when someone\u2019s over? Why can\u2019t I order catalog items? It\u2019s infuriating, particularly the inability to move things around your island or home. The crafting system and shops also sorely need updates. Why can\u2019t I craft more than one thing at once? Why do some of my DIY recipes require that I know other DIY recipes? Why can\u2019t I use a slider to buy however many flower seeds I want, like when buying turnips from Daisy Mae? Why can\u2019t I buy more than one shirt or pants at the Able Sisters? It never feels good to sit there and watch the crafting animation 30 times in a row because you\u2019re just trying to make fish bait to catch a rare fish. This should be much, much easier to do. There are some little improvements I love\u2014the drop-off box for selling items is great, and I like the way flowers are handled, as well as the terraforming. But why are custom paths still able to be destroyed with the B button (the same button for picking up items, mind you), and why can other people destroy them? If you\u2019re going to add paths to the game, and the ability to literally pave custom paths using this path tool, why don\u2019t they act like paths? The game is certainly not worth a 0/10, it\u2019s fantastic, but all of these small issues are a huge disappointment.","People is full of sh!t on this review. Buy your own game and do not think about you can pay 1 get 2. Game is awsome btw","This game is AWFUL. I purchased it for my 4 year old daughter thinking she could have a game that would allow her to create spaces. It looked pretty, cute, and easy to navigate. It isn't. It requires the user to be able to read (which is not the average 4 year old) and it's WORDY. Everything a character says is some lengthy explanation of what to do next. There's no action. It's boring. Complete waste of $64. Anything I purchase for the Switch going forward will be from the Mario genre. Don't waste your money on Animal Crossing.","This game is not a multiplayer game. Only the first player will be able to fully enjoy the game, since they will be the mayor, the other who start playing later will not be able to decide how the island will develop, since they will be forced to live on the same island.\r1 Island per profile Nintendo! This is a blatant attempt to force consumers to buy more systems, stop being so greedy!","Not only can I not have my own island, I can\u2019t progress in the game until my wife hits certain milestones in the game. I spent 8 hours playing the game trying to figure out why I didn\u2019t have an axe yet and it was because she didn\u2019t show a NPC two bugs... straight trash designed to sell consoles. HARD PASS.","Wanted to play this game with my partner, turns out you can't. Wish I knew before purchasing the game. Fix your game Nintendo.","Throughout quarantine, this game manages to bring me and my friends together - not to mention helps us make new animal-esque ones! An adorable, casual gem that can (and will) take over your life.","Love the game but it can't be understated how ludicrous the one island per switch limitation is. My rating is unfair on the game but Nintendo's being unfair on us, forcing us to buy another \u00a3300 system for a limitation that simply doesn't have to be there. Imagine they only had one save for each system for the likes of Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild!","Made this account specifically to warn people about the nefarious business tactics that are underpinning the cute aesthetics.If you plan on playing this game with other people in your household on a single switch then think again as that really isn\u2019t possible. Only 1 game/island per switch, not per profile. Additional profiles can only visit the 1st players game and cannot start their own. This is a conscious design decision by Nintendo to try and force households to purchase a console for every member of household. So it\u2019s not \u00a350 for the game. It\u2019s actually the amount of people in your household x (\u00a350 + \u00a3200). A rip off basically.Sort it out Nintendo, you know you\u2019ve done this deliberately and could easily fix it","Update - scored this a 6 after a few weeks but now a few months in and it\u2019s gotten very dull. If you enjoy a game with no direction or goal at all where you just repeat the same boring menial tasks over and over (with horrendous UI) for no reason get this - if you want a similar game but with interesting stories and things to aim for get the far far superior Stardew Vally. (Which is also \u00a340 cheaper! And 100 times more fun) I\u2019ll break down AC simply Boot upSee nothing is happening Collect the same Fruit/fossils you have collected for the past 40 days Sell them Check turnip pricesHear the same dialogue from your villagers you\u2019ve heard (well read) for the 50th time.All this takes about 5-10 minsTurn off for another day and wonder why you spent \u00a350 on a mobile game for a \u00a3300 console.And repeat.   . 1st of all no way this game is a 10 but neither is it a 0!The game is relaxing and a good way to chill and out get your creative mind going to see what ideas you can come up with for your island and it can be good fun! And building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed. The fossils part is done well and actually displays them in a chronological and evolutional order which is fun to discover and I\u2019m sure kids will love it.    However this lasts about a week and then after that it starts to wear a bit thin.I have no problem with the real time aspect of the game per-say (I also dolt mind the accelerated clock in Stardew Vally both have their merits) however I do feel like it was done to extend the life of the game. And the repetitive nature of the game does become a bit boring you will find yourself just doing the same menial tasks over and over for little or no reward. At times it does feel like a mobile game you have paid \u00a350 for to play on a \u00a3300 console. Also it\u2019s 2020 Nintendo why is it not a fully 3D game? Not being able to rotate the camera 360 degrees? I mean come on.Not being able to craft more than 1 thing at a time is also annoying I have 8 clams and I want to make 8 fish bait, I can\u2019t just select make 8 and it does it, no you have to go through the same process and animation 8 times! The islands you visit via nook miles will soon become repetitive as seems to be limited to about 10(?) different layouts I have visited the same island 3 times in 2 days. 6000 miles well spent.The dialog with your island buddies soon becomes irritating as they just repeat the same lines over and over and don\u2019t really offer anything. Multiplayer is a mess why can\u2019t I open my gate and my friends just pop over? No I have to sit through the same loading screen and animation for every person that visits and same when they leave plus when they are arrive there is nothing to do? No mini games or anything to do together which is a shame. I have also knocked a point off for the 1 island per console stroke that Nintendo have pulled just to try and sell more units - luckily me and my wife are happy to share a character so in our house it\u2019s not an issue but I can see how it could cause problems. The tools breaking without any warning is also frustrating! Why no status bar? We had this in Minecraft a game that was made in what 2007? And gold tools shouldn\u2019t break! I\u2019ve worked hard for them and the they just break? It should be a reward for all your hard work. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m just moaning about the game as I have had fun playing it and i think of your prepared to look past the annoyances there is a good game in there! And it\u2019s a break from the normal FPS/Action/FIFA style games. I just wish a bit more thought was put into the UI and Quality Of Life of the player. I also have a sneaking suspicion that Micro Transactions are on the way as it\u2019s a game primed for it but I hope I\u2019m wrong!Would have got a 7/10 from me if it wasn\u2019t for the 1 island per switch idea. I think 6/10 is a fair score.","The game has a fantastic first two weeks that does a great job at constantly giving you new tasks that introduce new gameplay mechanics to the player. Once you complete the 'story', you're pretty much able to customize anything you want, resulting in the ability to make some pretty incredibly designed islands and homes.\r The presentation is fantastic. The game's graphics are very stylized and the NPCs are all very expressive, making the game feel like a real living world. The music is all very cute as well, especially the tracks by K.K. Slider.\r You will eventually reach a point where the game becomes a lot less fun to play for extended periods of time; which is the norm for Animal Crossing. Thankfully though, Nintendo seems to be planning on supporting the game after launch and have already re-introduced past features like the Art Museum and Redd.\r Other than the eventual wall you hit where the game becomes less fun, the only really big flaws are some annoying menu management and crafting quirks, which will hopefully be patched.","Looks fun but not a chance of me buying it until Nintendo allows two saves on one console. I'm not playing while my partner has to be second fiddle all the time or vice versa.\r You've sold millions of Switches nintendo. This seems a cynical ploy to push more Switch lites (why would anyone bother getting one of those?). That with the lack of discounting in the eShop, 3 year old games for \u00a350 still, you're looking worse as a company. Sony look like fluffy bunnies compared. The very least you can do for your customers (who mostly accept this pricing) is allow them to share games within a household.","This game is incredible! It\u2019s has so many improvements from previous Animal Crossing game and is an overall fun and charming experience! It\u2019s a lot of fun visiting friends islands and playing online with others! The game provides a hole new level of customization, with the ability to create new higher land, waterfalls, rivers and more! You can also customize many pieces of furniture and place furniture outside. All this allows you to really make the island how you want. Definitely a must have for anyone on the Switch!","Best game I've ever played with my special one. Stop bombing the score, it's not fair.","Extremely polished, but still have some things to improve, specially on the quality of life suction related crafting and terraforming","Good and fun game, only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 is the 1 island per console limitation.","Animal crossing siempre ha Sido una gran Saga y aunque el juego se sent\u00eda vac\u00edo, en la \u00faltima actualizaci\u00f3n se quita esa sensaci\u00f3n ya que meten las obras de arte","The PERFECT game during a stupid pandemic. My only gripe is what a lot of the lame brigading reviews mention, and that is that the account that starts the island ends up gatekeeping improvements. For anyone playing completely SOLO, locally, this isn't a problem. As a household of 3, my kid was first and now we have to play as her when she isn't interested in island management. Personally I am OK with just having the one island, however, the management side of things should have been extended to all players and not just the first one.\r This does not ruin the game completely and it's still a great successor to the series. Hopefully the devs can constructively move forward with an update that allows people to start easier. I wish I had known this limitation on launch day, but we stayed away from too much info so we didn't spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in.\r The community of designers is pretty awesome and both my wife and daughter love customizing their homes with the shared designs.","Don\u2019t let a review bomb discourage you from playing this game. Nay, this work of art.","Perfect, I have funny moments in all time with my family and solitarie. I recommend this game for all that want relax","Es mi primer animal crossing pero me parece muy bien juego, relaja, es bastante completo, podr\u00eda estar mejor pero es mejorable y posible que sea actualizado en un futuro.","Es muy buen juego , muy relajante y bonito, con buena m\u00fasica y gr\u00e1ficos preciosos","Desde la Nintendo gamecube no le daba una oportunidad a un animal crossing, sin embargo, ACNH me ha dejado pasmado sin darme cuenta m\u00e1s de 100 hrs de juego. Sin duda m\u00e1s que un juego un proyecto de vida online a largo plazo.","The Best Game in the Nintendo switch.El mejor juego en Nintendo switch por mucho.","Only one island per console! Such a ridiculous limitation to add. The first person to play the game on your console is permanently in charge of the island. Feels like I got cheated.","This is my experience as player 2 of this game. I cannot contribute to any of the game objectives, despite playing a lot.\rI can't make decisions about where to put my buildings or villagers houses. The multiplayer option is even worse as if you are a \"follower\" you cant even interact with animals or buy things in shops.\r The amount of arguments between younger family members that have ensued as a result of this weird player 1 power dynamic is almost not worth having the game.\r I am also worried about the inability to backup a copy of my island. What if something happens to my switch? too bad for me? And if the option does become available but only with a Nintendo online account, I will have to pay to keep my island backed up, even though I have already paid for the game?\r Not to mention the fact that even with owning TWO separate copies of New Horizons, neither will create a new island. This is completely different from playing Wild World as a child and I am so disappointed in the obvious greed that fuelled this decision. So to be able to make any decisions about their own island at all, player 2 has to pay up another few hundreds for a new switch. This is despicable especially as the switch is advertised as a family console.","Base game is good, however you can only have one island per switch which is just a super greedy move. Also the multiplayer is really slow and annoying, you can't craft in bulk which is just boring, the game has a lot of flaws that make me want to bang my head into the wall already","It's a complete disappointment that my partner, who has been playing these games for all of his life, had the first claim to an island and then I, who has never had the chance or interest to play any animal crossing game until now, will be unable to ever have the full game experience on the console that I had snagged from my friend for an unbeatable price. On top of the general principal of me refusing to buy another system just for one game, the console is OUT OF STOCK EVERYWHERE, and we don't live together so it's not like I can play anyway--I haven't seen him in almost two months, and I have to live away from my own home for a job, but even if I did buy a new system I can't even move my game to the console that I am already attached to after all of this is over?? What a joke. I'll probably never play this and not have any desire to play an animal crossing ever because this restriction has just ruined any joy I could possible ever have for this series.","One island per switch is a total joke!! I could maybe understand one per user but it\u2019s ridiculous that this isn\u2019t made clear before purchase.....","The one island per console ruined this game for a family with kids! DO NOT BUY IT until they fix it.I literally created an account for this reason.  Greed of the company to try and sell more consoles is inexcusable.","One island per switch? GTFO, what an absolute joke. What moron thought that was a good idea?","I made an account just to say the one island per console is a terrible gimmick for more people to buy your product. At least with ACNL you could buy another game to insert into the 3DS. This is absolute BS.","cant get the game because we are 2 people in our house and only one switch.","I really hope nintendo fixes the 1 island per switch, had high hopes of playing with my sister and friends online but this issue makes it unplayable","Wanted to buy this for my family, but I won't unless they remove the one island per switch restriction.","This is, overall, a pretty great game. However, it has one glaring problem that you've probably heard a lot about. All players have to share the same island and the player who logs on first becomes the \"Citizen representative.\" This is what ruins the game for most people. Luckily, myself and my brother managed to sort out this situation with each other, but it's hard for most people. We had to restart our island because my brother soft-locked the game for me. He chopped down all the trees in the accessible area. The mere fact that I managed to get soft-locked in an Animal Crossing game means that I can't, in good conscious, say that this is game is all that good. However, for single players and people who don't mind not having the powers of Citizen Representative, this game is really great. But most people playing this game don't fall into either one of those groups. I do really think it's a shame that Nintendo included this mechanic, because it absolutely ruins what should have been the best Animal Crossing game.","The inability to have more than one island is insane! I love this game and have played every AC game since Population Growing, I'm an avid fan. I'm leaving a poor review because I just found out that you can't have a second island without buying an entire new switch. How could Nintendo alienate their fanbase like that? Especially during a pandemic when we're all broke and can't afford a new console! Nintendo if you're trying to get an extra $200+ dollars from your fans, you've failed! Instead you've lost an extra $60.\r Also, give us diagonal paths! Holy moly.","Scoring this wonderful game a zero because of the \"primary player\" limitations. My wife is currently the primary and therefore, gets a bunch of missions she doesn't want. More egregiously she is the only character who can make infrastructure changes to the island. I would be a little more forgiving BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THIS LIMITATION WHEN YOU START THE GAME. We had to find this out after I wasn't getting the \"infrastructure\" option with Tom Nook and then Googled why.\r This is a stupid limitation. Secondary players should be able to contribute to island infrastructure even if a \"primary\" player has to allow this somehow. Nintendo needs to fix this idiocy. What a disappointment to learn after playing for so long.","I am very disappointed by the glaring design flaws for multiple users on a single switch. Limiting 1 island per copy is disappointing, but limiting progressing island development forward to the first player is unacceptable. I have never seen any game developer limit critical features to the player experience to a singular player. I would not have purchased this game had I known that only one player can enjoy the full game. The only method to resolve these issues is to purchase another console which is clearly not worth while.","Juste HONTEUX de vendre un jeu 60 BALLES pour n'avoir le droit qu'\u00e0 une seule et UNIQUE ile ! ma copine a lancer le jeu en premi\u00e8re et du coup je ne peu pas y jou\u00e9 et profiter de ma propre ile et de l'histoire! Nintendo cherche des moutons \u00e0 tondre! C'est la derniere fois que j'achete nintendo","The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is nonsensical. It\u2018s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles... Sorry but this is an instant 0/10","This is a super fun game.  I enjoy.  My son enjoys it.  The problem (and it is a huge problem) is that you can only have 1 island per switch and the person who created the island is effectively the only one who can really make any decisions about the island.  In my house, we have 2 switches, but there are four of us who would like to play animal crossing.  That leaves 2 people very upset and for me, drops this game all the way down to one star for all the problems it creates in my house.  It is frankly ridiculous that I would need to buy four switches so each member of my family could enjoy the game.  Moms beware.","While I would love to give this game the glowing review it deserves, I cannot truthfully do so. The simple fact that no two players can have their own island on the same Switch is outrageous. This feature makes the game not worth purchasing if you intended to share it with someone else. This should be changed, but as long as it stays the same this game is not worth it for more than one person.","Only good if you're the first player- the player who sets the game up. If you're the second player, you can't do anything except upgrade your house and sell stuff. If you don't share a switch with anyone, it would be great! If you have multiple players, there's no way around it. You'd have to delete your island.\rWouldn't bother buying the game until it's fixed- IF they decide to fix it.","Really not for every one. Be sure you'll like it before spending a 100 bucks on this. Just learned there's only one island per switch too, which is ridiculous.","Started after my wife and I could not chose the island, the position of key buildings, had to play in her island as a \"second player\", no materials left, no chance to do stuff if she dont continue the story. Worst game design ever. Strategy from Nintendo to get $$ because they only allow one island per console.","The UI is annoyingly inconvenient and conversations with villager are repeating and empty. The fact that tools frequently break without any notification is also irritating.\r Many furniture is reduced from previous New Leaf. Furthermore, despite the \"remake\" option in DIY, most of the furniture with colour variation is not remake-able. There are about 6 colour types for all furniture, but a single player can collect only one type of them on their own. To get the colour that you don't have, you have to do multiplayer which again is so inconvenient mainly because of 1-minute freezing time inserted each time when a player joins to an island.\r Furthermore, although this game is advertised to enjoy the multiplayer, there aren't many things to do online except trading furniture or selling turnip (online mini-games existed in New Leaf is now gone). Not to mention that other systems that were available in previous games, such as town ordinance and haniwa, are now deleted.\r But the graphic is ok considering it is animal crossing.","I was so disappointed with this game. It was so exciting with all the new features and the amount of control you have over the island, as well as the option for local multiplayer. I'm the eldest of 3 siblings and we share a switch, but they can't play the way I play at all. Like everyone is saying, this is the dumbest idea Nintendo could have possibly come up with. I'm sure they want to sell more switches but not everyone can afford to spend 400 dollars just to play the new animal crossing game. Shame on you, Nintendo.That's not even all of it, the gameplay itself is atrocious. Put aside the 1 island per switch issue and you're left with a game that uses up half of your playtime in menus you can't speed up. At least in New Leaf and such you had the option to skip through dialogue with (B) and not have to sit there button mashing for a good 30 seconds just to go to Tortimer's island, for example. The crafting would be SO fun if it wasn't so tedious.I was also excited about the path system! That was something we desperately needed but the way it works is really infuriating when you just want your island to look neat. Having grassy gaps and not being able to fill in spaces under or around structures... it boils me alive. I know I'm nitpicking at this point, but they made Animal Crossing for the switch. It should pride itself in a little more polish and playability.","If I were the first player, I would definitely rate this game 100, it's really really good. But unfortunately for other players, it is impossible to enjoy the game as much as the first player, especially since the first player is in charge of the island development. I can't believe critic reviewers called this game \"family-friendly\" when clearly only one member of the family can enjoy this game. Now it is possible to buy a second switch, but now they cost $500 because of the shortage. This is by far the most restrictive game I've ever played.","I'm sure others have the same problem involving more then one person wanting to play, BUT they have to share an island. I got the game and played for a bit, then my brother got a hold of it and began playing. Now he's way ahead of me,the orignal and first person to play the game-and there are allot of stuff just spread out across MY island.IThe fact that you can't just have your own seperate island and experiance it yourself first hand and NOT ruin the game for anyone else. Is just stupid and horrible and takes the fun out of it to the point you don't want to play anymore.","Todo la genialidad se va a la basura por la limitante del multijugador, f\u00f3rmula ya constante en Nintendo.","Bought the game for siblings. Getting them to take turns at all is an achievement, so upon finding out that only one person can progress the story made this an immediate fail. I understand that there has to be some restriction in place to curb cheating and self-selling, but this can't be the way. I'm not sure we'll even keep playing it now.  Hoping the developers will hear the unhappiness and allow at least two islands per system.","Was enjoying this game but then my Switch started to fail from a cooling fan failure...so I  went and got a new switch .... oh sorry we can't move your island maybe next year.... ok so we will start a new island and now that family members who really enjoyed it can make one and we can all start at the same place .... oh yeah sorry again only one island PER CONSOLE .....ummm if you have kids how the heck are you gonna have them all agree where to put things and the style of island this is ridiculous ... i went from enjoying this game to being able to see nothing but the money grab faults of design","Just got this game for my birthday. I was looking forward to playing it along with my brother until I found out about the 1 island per console feature. He's the one who started the game up so he's the primary player and I'm just a visitor on his island who can't contribute or progress the game in any meaningful way. I was extremely disappointed when I logged onto my account and saw the same island instead of an entirely new save file. The game would be a lot better without this blatant cash grab of a policy and I have to say I regret buying it. Don't bother wasting $60 if you share your switch, because to experience the game in full you'd need to fork over an additional $300 or so for a new switch plus another copy of the game. So basically $360 per island. Nice. The reason I rate it so low is to draw attention to this glaring issue. Not everyone is fortunate enough to just go out and buy as many switches as their heart desires.","The one island per console is ruining the game so bad. It is hard to create progress.","One island per switch is just greedy practice. Really shows that Nintendo only really cares about money. It is very disappointing that there is nothing we as individuals can do about it.","This would be a great game, but the fact that you are limited to one island per switch console completely kills it for households with multiple users. What on earth were you thinking, Nintendo?!?! Please release a patch that fixes what is one of the worst game design decision ever.","This game has the potential to be great, but Nintendo is essentially trying to **** you out of hundreds of more dollars as you can only have one save file per switch console, not per profile but per console, you can\u2019t even buy two copies of the game, you need a second console. This is absolutely garbage, and Nintendo should be ashamed of themselves.","Angry about the one player feature that limits the game to a single person per console. I think this is unfair and there are ways that Nintendo could fix this and stop being so money hungry. I think at the very least players should not have a \"resident representative\" on an island. This makes it so only one player can make decisions and really do anything important on their island. I think this is wildy unfair considering that in order to fix this you would have to buy a second console which is just ridiculous. The switch is pricey enough as it is so it's only right that multiple people could play this switch exclusive game on a single console. Even though the rest of the game has good content, for people with kids who play or really anyone who wants to play with other people in their household, it's a huge problem. I'm reviewing so low in hopes to get ratings down so Nintendo will hopefully fix this problem.","I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and decided to let her play first because she thought the game looked fun and cute. I\u2019m horrified, now, to see that anything that needs to happen to move the game forward requires her, as primary resident, to complete before any secondary player (me) would be able. The one island per console rule is just asinine. JFC, Nintendo! Way to turn me off to a franchise.","ACNH focuses so much on creating a charming sandbox that it forgets to respect its players. Nintendo has yet to outgrow their penchant for text boxes / animations in extreme excess that serve only to waste your time, and multiplayer is a plane-infested disaster, sorely lacking meaningful ways to interact with others outside of an online economy sullied by time travel and hacking. Will consider changing rating to a solid 6 if Nintendo unlocks multiple islands per switch and drastically improves user experience. (Suggestion: multi craft/print/buy.) Unlocking the full range of island customization is sadly when the fun and desire to customize died; I'd value this game at $20 in its current state as a primarily single player game.","I was really excited for this game. Looked like it could have been amazing. However, my opinion changed when I found out the froggy chair was removed. Come on, Reggie, why did you do that?","Only one island per console?!  What a waste of money this game is!  $60 gets you a giant FU from Nintendo, save your money!","WORST Game in the world! I got banned off of dodocodes,com because of somebody who was majorly butthurt with me going onto an Island and taking FRUIT when I seriously didn\u2019t know you we\u2019re NOT at all supposed to, the game and DodoCodes are not only the Worst websites on the planet because together allow butthurt players and gamers onto each other\u2019s islands when they cause nothing but pure drama! But also just because I had a low rating from ONE star from an over dramatic player that I took fruit from when I sware I didn\u2019t know you were\u2019t supposed to take fruit from their islands and I got reported and had My account taken down without my side being heard!!! Your disgusting animal crossing and Dodocodes.com I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t supposed to take fruit from other people\u2019s islands.","So I guess only one member of my family gets to play the game unless I buy everyone theit own individual Switch?  That's greedier than Activision.","I created an account just to post this.  They released an update which drastically lowered the rare fish spawn rate.  I've wasted over 200 fish bait trying to catch one golden trout.  This is unplayable now.  Who has time for all this?","it's just an empty game. Compares to the other Animal Crossings in the past, Nintendo just released a incomplete game  saying 'oh we are going to update stuff slowly as what others expect from Animal Crossing!'. Also very worried about DLCs in the future as I have feeling that they might release and sell something that we expected from the game that it supposed to be there!","I gave this game a 10 score for being a refined island getaway, but I need to take that back. Honestly once you get a 5-star island, a 6 room house, all your favorite villagers in your island, and do a couple of big events, then New Horizons starts to get old. You notice the flaws within the game; it's limited in its features, the graphics &amp; camera angles can feel clunky at times, and it's not even complete yet.","Multiple players on one switch, one island. Paid for half of the game, get to participate in about a quarter of the gameplay.","Animal crossing: New Horizons Is the sparkling new addition to the animal crossing franchise. It was received greatly when it came out and I'm sure we can all admit it's a very pretty game.Unfortunately the attraction to this game is about skin deep, it doesn't take long to break down the gameplay and run out of goals to accomplish. It starts to get boring and honestly kind of tedious to even open. When you get started it's a lot of fun to explore your new town and look at all the new and updated graphics, but after awhile the furniture and clothing starts getting repetitive, and the lack of gameplay freedom starts to just get frustrating. This is a beautiful mobile game that they shelled out for 60 dollars.","Only one island is pretty uncomfortable but after 2 months playing I really love this game.","This game came at the perfect time when quarantine started. All we needed was a relaxing game where people could play with each other online while stuck in our houses. Animal Crossing New Horizons is just that. This game is absolutely amazing.","Cual es la razon de poner UNA SOLA ISLA PARA CADA CUENTA esta fue la peor idea que a nintendo se le haya ocurrido la verdad que estoy decepcionado, porque en si el juego es bueno lo unico malo es que solo hay UNA ISLA y ademas de que no puedes avanzar en la isla amenos que seas la persona que la creo, la verdad decepcionante","Absolutely abhorrent behavior from Nintendo to ruin so many people's experience on the off chance that they buy another nintendo switch. Just horrible.","This games is amazing. Creating your very own, unique island is extremely fun. This game is so close to being perfect but it is missing a fair amount of the previous game's content. This will all most likely be resolved when updates come out. Nearly perfect.","Mal juego esta muy sobrevalorado este juego solo es para ni\u00f1os y esta basada en la comunidad mas de 10 de nintendo.","nintedoooo esta dormido.... falta arriesgar mucho mas en sus juegos, para un publico mas maduroo\rsigue apoyando a juegos muy infantiles...","mierda de juego para sasel y nenes de 4 a\u00f1os. el juego no vale ni para tirar cohetes.....no lo compreis.","No support for multiple users is completely unacceptable in 2020. I love Nintendo but this really needs to stop.","One island per user has completely ruined the game experience for me.  The switch has always been a family console and expecting families to purchase multiple machines in order to have their own island experience is simply unforgivable.","One Island per Switch. With multiple people in the same household sharing the same switch.","I do looooove the game. But how come that I need to get a second console to have my own island??? A huge disappointment. Shame on you Nintendo","I literally made an account here just to review this game. (Your dream get away begins now) No it doesn't, It's not MY dream get away when I'm the second third fourth- eight player and i have to share one island with everyone who uses the same switch consul.  i deserve my own island and at very least should be able to purchase another game card to have my own island, not an entire system! I now refuse to play this game I should have never purchased it as it causes nothing but grief and bitterness between the member's of my household. Nintendo should either fix this ridiculous issue or I hope they get the lawsuit they deserve filed on behalf of disgruntled families everywhere whose children spend countless hours fighting over this game. Maybe that will make Nintendo rethink their greedy ways.","I love the animal crossing games so much but this one was a serious let down if you have to share a console. Let my daughter play first and now I can\u2019t do anything. Really don\u2019t want to spend another 200 for a switch just so I can play this game. They need to update a patch that lets you switch island reps or let us have different islands on the same console because this is really lame.","Bought this game with the intention of sharing with the wife. Let her have a go first and when I came to play it, had the horrible realisation that I was just a second character on her island.As much as I tried to get into it, it was hard and felt like everything I did was pointless as she was already so far ahead and built most the stuff on the island. This needs to be fixed as it\u2019s a major issue. I don\u2019t know of any other game that has the issue and it\u2019s just ridiculous for a \u00a350 game.","One island per console is ridiculous.

However those things to do become repetitive when you are the second player.

I hope they come up with a way to fix it or im just gonna have to return it.","Me and my sister bought this game together only to find we couldn\u2019t both play the game on our own islands. My sister plays but since I\u2019m not the island representative it\u2019s really no fun playing as you can\u2019t experience over half of the game. The game seemed promising but as long as only one person per Switch can play it gets a zero from me.","I share my Switch with my 9 and 4 year old daughters.  We have different play styles and all want the ability to explore the island, shape it, name it and play as we each see fit.  Having only one island makes this a single person ever game and completely poisons it.  It paints Nintendo in a deeply cynical light and has wrecked an otherwise decent game.","I love this game, I always loved it but as a player 2 I am devestated to realize that I basically have no function on the island and can't really do anything.

It is a fraud, 50\u20ac for a solo game. Nintendo fix this soon or the animal crossing serie is dead. Why do you have an account engine in the console if you don\u2019t use it?","I give it a destroying 0 simply because Nintendo deliberately chose to make it only fun for the first player who created the island. Now my wife purchased the game and created it without knowing this, a couple of weeks into it, my son has joined the adventure only to find out he cannot make most decisions and is limited by how far my wife has progressed. I started playing to see what it was all about and indeed, it's a utterly terrible decision made by Nintendo to require you to buy 1. another switch console and 2. another ACNH copy and 3. not allow you in any way to keep your save game online and 4. not allow you to transfer the part that you've progressed to another Switch console with another game copy netting \u20ac260! So the game doesn't deserve anything more than a 0. Nintendo should feel the pain and fix this. For any other game I know it's super easy to do all those things on the same console and heck, even the free-to-play Fortnite gives me the possibility to switch between Xbox and Switch freely, the same goes with my son and we don't even need the Online membership to play online. Yet here we are with ACNH and I wouldn't be bother with the \u20ac35 additional yearly membership for a family subscription, if it would allow the full experience and not limit you to the progress of the first player, which becomes frustrating extremely quickly. And not just that, you know what the only option is for the 2nd/3rd/4th player when (in this example my wife) the first player stops liking ACNH and therefore stops playing? You might've guessed it... start completely over with a completely blank island altogether, there is no way to transfer the ownership or keep your own progress in any way. I'll keep repeating this, but this is a terrible decision by Nintendo and basically one that says: we only cater to those willing to shell out huge amounts of money on a duplicate console and a duplicate copy of the game. For that Nintendo deserves a 0 for ACNH.","This series is starting to focus more and more on things that I don't enjoy.\rNook is even more of a slave driver, and the merit system makes the game feel more stressful. And this time around you need to pay for everything, including bridges and inclines. By the time I was done with those and got access to the new terraforming feature, I was completely exhausted to the point that I don't feel like playing this anymore. Having to replace broken tools every five minutes certainly doesn't help.\r All of that wouldn't be so bad if the villager dialogue wasn't (against all odds) even worse than in City Folk. I've been playing for a couple of weeks, and have already heard the same lines about 'digging up fossils yesterday' nearly a hundred times. Dialog is more generic than before. For instance, the villagers say that 'you wear that a lot' about everything as opposed to the previous AC games where they'd comment about WHAT you're wearing, etc. And while you can now place furniture outdoors, these too get generic responses from the animals: 'who put a drinking fountain outside? That's so weird'.\r In short, New Horizons is tedious, and I can't see myself playing it for more than a couple of weeks. Not when I could just play Wild World or New Leaf instead, either of which are much superior to this in everything but graphics.","This is the easiest review I'm gonna make in my life, what game is so amazing that it can be sold for 680 dollars?\rThis is how much I need to spend in Brazil to purchase a switch and a copy of animal crossing.\rIf I want to have me, my son and my wife to play the game as I usually do to any game I buy, I have to spend 2.040 dollars, what game in the world is worth that much for family fun?\rEasy answer, easy review, there are way better games out there that will make you enjoy your time playing while you comfortably wait for the release of Hokko Life, that is going to be launched this year and is a similar game to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and for PC, without the console bound restriction (means you can buy many copies of the game without needing extra PCs to play).","Playing 2nd fiddle to my 8 Year old daughter is a bit insane. Its not even the one island problem.  Its not a complete game.  I turned on the game appeared at an airport and am dropped off with almost no tutorials or quests. It is an incomplete experience for anyone that is not the first person to play the game. Thank God I don't have other children.  They should do something about this. I mean even purchasing a second copy of the game will not work around this. A simple DLC should be able to fix this broken concept  For players who have their own switch and are not in families will definitely have better reviews though. Its hard not to give it a zero unless you are the island creator","Unfortunately this game (like most Nintendo games) falls under the umbrella of extreme Nintendo fanboydom and as such is subject to insanely high biased reviews (not including the negative multiplayer ones).\r Basically if you've ever played a game outside of the Nintendo lineup say like...\r Minecraft, Terraria, Rimworld, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Starbound, Kenshi, etc etc etc. you quickly realize that there is almost nothing to Animal Crossing and certainly nothing making it worth paying full price for.\r The world is extremely tiny, it's based on real time (which is cool on paper but terrible in practice), it's got 0 challenge, and it plays like a mobile game (in fact it looks just like it's mobile version Pocket Camp).  You can run the entire starting area in about a minute, there are woefully limited resources across the entire island and woefully limited events or things to do across the entire game.\r It is quite \"chill\" which can be a nice change of pace for about 10 to 20 minutes, but once you get past the bubbly exterior you quickly notice that there are no brains on the inside to keep you engaged and entertained.","Both my wife and I wanted to play this game on our switch. Apparently that isn't possible. For shame.","The thing I find most annoying about New Horizons, is the strange and often terrible design decisions that have players jumping through hugely inconvenient and annoying hoops just to get back to the fun.\r However, once I get over that, this game is astronomically divine. It's calming and rewarding in a way that other games can't be. It has charm that can never be shaken. It has characters that you will adore and build long-lasting attachments to. It has the nerve to make chores desirable, and it has the special sauce that we all needed during this quarantine.\r This is a game that was created with the highest amount of polish possible in this industry, but most importantly, it was made with an absolutely overwhelming amount of love &amp; care, and it shows through and through","Simply the best Animal Crossing to date. All the best features from the past Animal Crossings on Nintendo's best console in decades. Been playing it since day one and I'm still finding fun things to do. Nintendo just keeps hitting it out of the park. My girlfriend loves it too. A must buy!","Endless fun!  I've put in over 300 hours since launch and don't see any end in sight.","There's a lot of negative reviews complaining about the lack of ability to create your own unique island. Now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game. I realise it may not apply to a large subset of players. On the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that don't care about that.\r I felt I wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game, to give those that probably sit in the middle of not being a long time fan, and having played this game for the first time, like me. I've put in roughly 50 hours into this game. With only 2 days of time travel done at the beginning to speed up the nothing you can do in the first 2-3 days of owning this game.\r Effectively, the good parts. Nintendo, as always are very good at creating charming worlds. Filled with lovely character, and look really nice. The graphics are wonderful to behold. One fo the best aspects of this game in my particular view is the designing as pects. There is a lot of items and a lot of ways they can be utilised to make unique little biomes for yourself to enjoy and feel creative. I had a lot of fun organising my house.\r Beyond that though. There really is not a whole lot to do. Once you've built the shop/museum and got a few rooms of your house. This game gets insanely repetitive. The game becomes, pick fruit. fish a little, dig your 4 fossills(which, you run out of unique ones super quick). Hit some rocks, and buy some of the new clothes. Slowly making money to add a new room to your house. It's rinse and repeat of that, for about an hour every day as once you've completed that routine, there is nothing else to do.\r The big thing is that i was doing all of that, to get the terraforming. I spent an hour a day doing this repetitive nonsense so I could terraform and really make the island my own. when I finally got terraforming. I finally had to go, yep that's enough for me.\r See here is the big major issue with this game. The repetitive stuff, lots of people can look past. they find it relaxing and stress free, a nice mindless task to focus on and remove the pressures of life from. Me, I don't really get it, I like being creative, so that's why I stuck to it. The thing is though, that Nintendo seem to be stuck in the early 90's when it comes to game mechanics. There are so many barriers in the way of you trying to enjoy this game to the best of its ability. The constant repetition of dialogue, the inability to organise your inventory properly, the inability to build more than one item at a time, or buy more than one item at a time- which is annoying in the Nook atm machine- but ten thousand times worse when at the Abel sisters house and you have to keep walking in and out of the dressing room if you want more than 1 shirt at a time. The seemingly no reason for why trees wont grow. The multiplayer is gimped hard too, Nintendo and internet simply do not work. You want a friend to come over. Cool, go to the airport and open your gates, hidden behind 10 mintues worth of dialogue. Jesus Christ Nintendo, allow me to have my gates open at all times, or at least allow my friends to request to come over through the use of the Nook phone. A quick invite and join system through the phone. But no, it's a whole infuriating process- even after they've visited the first time and become a \"best friend\". Either Nintendo are incredibly incompetent at game QOL, or they know how to fix these things and don't in order to artificially increase game time, because they know how little actual game-play there is in this game.\r Terraforming, is without a doubt one of the most poorly implemented mechanics I've seen Nintendo create, and I genuinely don't know if this game was actually tested properly. Because it is a joke. There is no marker for where you are creating, and it will constantly, and randomly, without any logic choose a different square to work on, regardless of if you do the same action. On top of that, you will either fill land in, or remove land, with the exact same button- use the rest of the buttons Nintendo. One for filling one for removing land. How insanely hard is that to think of. Forcing you to work several times on the same squares because of the lack of any guidance and logic to the system. This game reeks if eitehr laziness or incompetence. I don't know which, and I don't much care. But this game is not even close to being perfect, and has a lot of work needing to be done on it to make it beyond a 6/10.\r TLDR; Had some fun with creating, but there are way too many terrible UI/Game mechanics, and repetitive annoying dialogue to allow me to think it is a good game.","This is a fantastic game. Let's get that nailed in right out of the gate, because while I agree with the complaints about Nintendo's handling of cloud saves, individual islands and so on, I don't think that reflects so poorly on the game that it deserves to be review-bombed. Though I do believe review-bombing has its place and if it helps, then so be it, I won't object.\r This is the BEST Animal Crossing game. Period. It's not only visually stunning, it has tons of improvements large and small that have made this a joy to continue to play. Usually I'm done with Animal Crossing by now. I buy a copy, I play it for a month or two, then I drop it and rarely ever come back unless really bored and only for a few minutes, even for holiday events.\r But with the wide depth of customization options for your villager, your home and your island, this really is the most control we've ever had in an Animal Crossing game.\r To counter the negativity, let's point out some of the pros:\r First, you can customize your character right from the start, rather than getting random hair and face options. You have limited options at the start, but you can unlock more later and it's as simple as checking your face in a mirror to change literally any aspect of your little avatar's personal appearance.\r Storage items are linked to your house storage. Namely your clothing. So basically not only will your wardrobe serve as a wardrobe (even if placed outdoors), but so will your fridge, your cooler, your safe, etc. It's a little silly, but honestly it's a nice way of having a way of changing your outfit wherever you go while blending the furniture in. Don't want a wardrobe outside just to change? Put a fishing cooler by the shore or something. It's great.\r Second, you can place furniture items outside. This, combined with the much-touted island designer tool (place paths, pools or rivers of water and cliffs), allows you to make your town look the way you want it like New Leaf could only DREAM of achieving. Gone are the public works projects for a bench that take a whole day and a ludicrous amount of funding (and weird celebrations about a piece of furniture being delivered). Gone are the days of feeling like your town would take YEARS to look the way you want it to, with cheap paths that hitting the wrong button over would get rid of (though that feature is still there for custom design paths and I HATE IT; fix this, Nintendo).\r Now if you want to have a bench outside Able Sisters for your villagers to rest their buns, you just find a bench (or build one yourself with the handy new crafting system) and place it. That's it. You can even move it around like it was inside of your house.\r Third, as mentioned, CRAFTING. Many people were worried about this when it was introduced and there are valid complaints about it that even I have, but this is 100% a change for the better, it really is. Yes, your tools now break. And that sucks. Especially since all tools break now and you can't even check durability, but making them is easy enough and that's only a small part of what this system offers. There are tons of basic, unique and holiday-oriented craftable items that you can make over and over if you're dedicated enough to find the recipes, the materials and make them. And since getting recipes is a daily affair (every day there will be a bottle on the beach with a random, hopefully new, recipe in it), you're going to discover tons of cool new stuff every week, as long as you keep turning Animal Crossing on and messing about.\r Fourth, Nook Miles. I don't think I've heard anyone complain about this. And no one should. It's nothing but a good thing to give you incentives to do stuff like fish, catch bugs, hunt fossils, talk to villagers, etc. It's encouragement in the form of \"miles\" to get you to play the game, where you can then redeem those miles for special recipes and items for yourself and your town. Custom phone case, fence recipes (fences are great for customization and another perk of the new game), furniture items, nook miles tickets to go to a randomized island and hunt collectible fish/bugs and resources.\r You'll first start off with static, one-time-only rewards like a couple hundred miles for catching 10 bugs, then a thousand or so for 100, then catch 200+ and you get 2,000 miles (along with titles for your villager's passport, if that at all interests you, which you also get miles for editing once). Then after paying off your vacation package with those earned miles, you can build a house and start earning miles in the form of daily, renewable objectives (shoot a balloon down for some miles or assess x number of fossils) so you never run out of things to keep working towards if you want to keep yourself busy. It's great motivation to keep playing, though eventually it does become a bit bland, I won't lie. Still, I like having it.\r I've run out of characters, sadly. It's a fun game.","I thought I hadn't played this game, but it turns out I've been the 9th player the whole time missing out on little more than player 2-8, in fact I'd say I'm much more satisfied at my rating.","This game is delightful.\r I'm writing this review to counteract the people giving it a ZERO because they don't like the one-island setup.  Yeah, you don't like it, I get it.  People are getting hundreds of hours of entertainment from a $60 game.  There is literally nothing else in life that gives that much money-to-entertainment ratio.  Even the cost of another Switch factored in (plus all the other games you'd play on it and be entertained by), it is still a great deal.  The single island thing is definitely a cash grab move, but is still better than most companies doing the micro-transaction thing.  The hours of entertainment involved with modern systems/games far outweigh the cost involved (when compared to other types of entertainment, such as movie theaters or dinner or theme parks, etc etc).\r Actual criticism about the game itself:\r I don't like that when you BUY stuff you get a chance to buy something else without restarting the conversation, but when you SELL stuff, you can sell that one thing and then have to start the conversation over.  Only a minor annoyance, though.\r I wish that in the out-of-doors, you could get an idea of where you're about to set an item down (and how big of a space it needs).  You spend a lot of time guessing and then getting an alert that there isn't space there.  In time, you get a better idea.  Again, just a minor annoyance.","The best Animal Crossing game ever made. But there are some things that should get an update. There are certain objects that should be mass-crafted, not just one by one. Every tool is too easy to break, specially the upgraded ones. Also I feel like the island lacks more buildings.","Uno de los videojuegos mas adictivos y divertidos que he jugado durante los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. De los pocos que me hacen ponerme a jugar todos los d\u00edas de la semana, y desear despertarme cada d\u00eda para poder encender la consola y hacer las tareas nuevas que tengo ese d\u00eda.\r Ya quisieran los usuarios de otras plataformas tener algo parecido a esto en sus consolas. Juegazo.","Animal Crossing is addicting and well made, but I am firmly of the belief that it is not \"good\". Lacking elements of both previous games and even the mobile game, this Animal crossing has placed all of its eggs into the crafting and island decorating basket.\r It does a very good job and is very fun when you are crafting and decorating your island, but comes up tragically short everywhere else, feeling more like an addictive chore than any of its predecessors.","I will probably keep coming back to this from time to time, but I am going to \"call it\" now because I went from playing EVERY day since it came out to not touching it in over a week and no real plans to return to it.\r Still, I got a LOT of great slice-of-life gameplay. I had good times with friends online. I made my island exactly how I wanted it. (Though I only got 3 stars)\r The annoying bits (the time to \"travel\", text repetition, DIY-ing multiple copies, limited storage space, etc.) are very annoying but the charms of the animals, the addiction of collecting, the beauty of the game and its buildings and biomes are all wonderful and I appreciate my time with it.","Animal Crossing New Horizons Review: 5/10\rAlthough it can be fun at times, the game limits the player from playing the way they want.","My first AC and I have an amazing time playing it! I can understand the bad mood about the island limitation, though.","Very fun game until I realized the glaring issue, one island per Switch. I have two small kids who also play on it, and they're upset they dont get their own space to play. What a rip off. Regretting my purchase. Please fix this Animal Crossing devs.","Great graphics, great concept, tons of random items you can acquire and addictive specially the creativity part. The negatives though, i hate that they limit bunch of things, they basically limit the capability of the switch,","Fantastic game. A lot of stuff to do, nice graphics, tons of customization. The island limit is stupid, but the game is wonderful.","I haven't played since Animal Crossing for the Gamecube so I am not certain, how much of this content is new to this game, but I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  There is a lot to do, and the gameplay loop is quite satisfying.  There is one major issue I have with this game though that prevents it from getting a perfect score, and that is equipment breaking.  Its really annoying and even the golden tools can break.  That turns what was the ultimate reward in AC for the Gamecube, to a waste of resources in ACNH, and its a real bummer.  Additionally, multiplayer feels restrictive, why cant best friends place and move furniture when playing online?  I trust them, that's why they are best friends.","I have played this game every single day since launch and every day it feels me with joy, I have never time travelled and I believe that's the best way to play, although each to their own. I have slowly but surely built my island from the ground up and it's so satisfying when good ideas come to the fore once you get certain tools and items. Honestly, I cant reccomend this game highly enough, especially with what's been going on in the world, it's really helped me out. I have some amazing villagers at the moment like Sherb, Marina, Beau, Aurora, Marshal and Stitches and their personalities and traits are a pleasure to be around.I never thought I'd play any game every single day, but here I am and I think I'll be playing this game every single day until the n4xt game comes out it is incredible.Man, what a game, it shows you not all games have to be cinematic, stunning and brave, story driven and all that stuff, buy Animal Crossing New Horizons, you will not regret it, it's a real charmer!","The ps4 fanboys who have never played a video game in their life, hopefully Fifa.\r Ps4 Fanboys toxic! 10/10","Its Animal crossing but the multiplayer isn't good. Other than that it's great.","A relaxing game about life full of charm at every corner, it's easy to play ACNH for a few hours each day.","A great game ruined by nintendos lack of polish.\r Online is incredibly cumbersome, there is no way to back up saves, you can only have 1 island per switch screwing other people in your household, and crafting was very poorly done, requiring you to craft one thing at a time with no way to improve that.\r Tool durability is also just completely anti-fun.","Game was pretty fun at first, it however quickly becomes boring due to lack of content. Fans say its to span out recurring players by adding back ditched content later, but I was bored after the first month anyway so that didn't turn out well for them, the updates are way too small and far in between and I can't rate this game based on what it will become, that's Bethesda territory. Previous games supposedly had plenty of stuff like Nintendo themed furniture and exploring islands with friends, but here there's none of that and I don't care if they add it later, its not the game you get on cartridge. You should however keep all the content, and add on top of it. Not remove them and add them later like they're doing here.\r Everything takes forever, building new bridges and relocating a house takes a day and you can't do more than one, all this to just drag your time without a good reason, which is why people time travel, if you want to discourage time travelling by removing content, how about not making things take so long to do and putting up so many roadblocks?\r I do check back into it every few days but I'm never hyped to play more or partake in any tiny events Nintendo adds, they're completely deaf to fan feedback, like that infamous egg festival and the randomness of item recipes and such can lead to lack of tables to put stuff on, making you have to use cardboard boxes or place everything on the floor. Its also lacking the simple ability many life sims have...Craft. In. Bulk.","Only buy this if you are willing to put at least 5 to 10 hours into LEARNING how to do anything in the game. This is not a game for everyone and it gets really old after doing the same thing for weeks on end. I would suggest borrowing a copy form a friend after they get bored.","O jogo \u00e9 absolutamente tudo que um f\u00e3 de Animal Crossing poderia querer, quase 30 horas de jogo e sinto que minha ilha t\u00e1 apenas 10% do que eu queria e ainda h\u00e1 coisas a serem desbloqueadas, problema de 1 ilha por console \u00e9 o que afasta o jogo da perfei\u00e7\u00e3o","In an animal-subjected game, when almost everyone had asked how to remove animals on my island, the game must be a failure.","It is just another animal crossing game. It's long and kinda boring most of the time but partly by design. I do fell like like they have stripped away a lot of the NPCs personally.","I bought this game so my girlfriend and I could enjoy some quality, relaxing time under the covers together and play some video games. The idea of creating our own island sounded amazing! But the way couch coop is implemented is utterly terrible.","i honestly don't like graphics. whenever i see realistic or modern graphics   the game will be mediocre and thats what i feel about this game. there isn't much to do. And no i don't think adding more fish or more items will make this game any better. i was hoping for more things to do with construction tool but nope there is limit to it and there isn't any activities like hopping for more like when i had wash cars in the old  animal crossing not just holidays. i hope to travel somewhere interesting place like, city or just small house. Just some thing interesting not just island and islands and animals  to bring. i also don't want put every retail i meet in my island.And you can't kick villager which is annoying, and there villagers don't have any personality , no dislikes,  no unique dialog , and no unique rooms. except the five special characters and people are wondering why people wanted that cat so much because he hes unique","The game is pretty amazing for a while. I played nothing but this game for a while after I bought it. But after about 70 hours (which I realize is a lot) I started to become bored. I'm currently taking a break and it should be better after the break. And yes, you can only have one island per SYSTEM. I'm sure that Nintendo did this so that more people would buy consoles. But that's just stupid. This my first Animal Crossing game and it's a blessing that I got it during quarantine. It has made my life better. Overall, if you've liked AC games in the past, like games like this, or think it looks fun, you should absolutely get it. It's worth the money","Mi problema con este nuevo juego es que son muy interesante las cosas nuevas que meten como el crafteo y que sea una isla desierta y tengas que ir pobl\u00e1ndola y tal, pero tal vez me hubiese gustado m\u00e1s un juego como los anteriores.","I\u2019ve never played Animal Crossing before, sooo my bad, I should have researched the game first (didn\u2019t think I had to, ya know?). So yeah, I spent hours figuring out why I can\u2019t do **** this led me to look online to find some tutorials or tips, but learned that the first person to play the game is the only one to make major decisions or progress the game (I was the second player, obviously). Seriously?! That\u2019s utterly garbage. I\u2019ve never been so disappointed in a game before that I\u2019d make an account on metacritic just to post this review. Again, my bad, I should have looked into the game and read the reviews first before wasting my money.\r It\u2019s a cute game and the one island/primary player might work for some couples/families, but if you are completely new to Animal Crossing then know what you are getting into before buying.","You can't build two different island on the same console also with two different account and this is very bad. Just 6 for this game","I have almost no issue with this game only the fact that the crafting system could have been better, Like using your storage when you craft in the house and multi crafting but other wise i fully enjoy it. While the one island thing does not affect me i can see the issues with it i do hope Nintendo also patches it so the islands feel more sharable for a family or couple.","I feel this game is a little underwhelming for my taste. I love the characters and the noises, but the story is a little boring, but I like more action based games then pulling weeds and fishing, so who am I too say. It\u2019s just my opinion! I would still get!","This game is really awesome! Everyday is a n event! The game are working at real time, and it make just better. But I can have only one island. And multiplayer is terrible.","While being a first time I played this series while enjoying it  I can say that this was a good game to start with, but the 1 island a switch thing throws many people off so I\u2019m not giving it a10/10 but this is still a good game.","Would be 10/10, but they don't let you have multiple islands. If you buy another game on a separate profile you should be able to have a second island. So, instead you have to buy another switch to have more than one island which is stupid.\r(I am the only one playing this game in my family) Game play has been great. Typical animal crossing do nothing all day in real life while doing a lot in game. Enjoying the new egg hunt too.","everything is pretty good but it feels some things are missing that were in the original.  the biggest issue for me is the lack of things to do, while yes you can fish I feel it would be fun to have un-lockable items that add mini games or nes games like in the OG.  I also don't care for the villagers attitudes because they have little to none.  you only care about looks because in the OG many had attitude and sas but all the villagers here have about 5 lines of dialogue and that's it.  finally I don't care about the updates because it feels like they were all ripped strait from new leaf.  But besides those minor complaints the game is extremely fun to play with friends and family so overall it is a good game small issues.","Tons to do compared to the original and WW which were the last two in the series I played. So I'll just keep this simple and list the Pros and Cons.PROS: Tons to do around the island and always having an objective to work towards even if it is at your own pace it's nice to have something to work toward.The island is always growing and gives you a real sense of progression. It really feels like you're building something great.Many more residents per island then in the past and more variety when it comes to resident personality.Over all graphics and visual presentation is great as well as sound design.The ability to have local co-op is amazing and something I could've only dreamed of as a kid who I played the original with my brother on GameCube.CONS: One Island per console I know this has been stated to death but it is ridiculous that in this day and age that it's not technically plausible.The restrictions on co-op are a bit frustrating as I stated I'm stoked that they added local co-op but it just sucks they had to make it so stripped..If only they could've added a few more things, I mean simple things like both users being able to manage their menu instead of only the leader that's really all I wish they would've done honestly.. I wouldn't even ask for split screens or anything just the ability for both players to be able to pick up and sell items would've been amazing but instead it just feels like a half measure, it always ends up being a game of watching the leader do things or changing frequently so the other player can get stuff done. Frustrating because it could've been something so great.Animal Crossing is what amounts to be an amazing game, it just struggles on the multiplayer side of things which has never been Nintendo's strong suit except when it comes to local play so how did they mess it up so bad? It's unfortunate because that is what keeps this from being a full 10 in my eyes. It just feels like maybe the local play was a last minute thing they threw in and didn't get the TLC it deserved. And it just pains me to think of what could've been.","Some things that would improve the game 1) having your home inventory connected to all the work benches on your island or at least the one in your home2) have the golden tools be unbreakable its sooo annoying to have to keep remaking things3) have nooo pay you for your wook","Animal Crossing New Horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit. The game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only Tom Nook's small residential services tent in place to get you started. Not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but you also pick the locations of your first 2 villagers as well as future 8 other villagers as in order to keep with the starting from scratch theme you have to find most of your villagers yourself. Personally, I really like the idea of starting from scratch as it really feels like i have full control over my island and that everything on it has made because of me.\r The game goes by real time and every single day you have something new to do such as picking fruit from your trees, hitting rocks to get materials such as iron nuggets and filling up your town museum with bugs, fish, and fossils you find. But in order to get buildings such as the museum to access more things you do, Tom Nook gives you tasks every day to help gain the access to new buildings and functions. The game is very relaxing to me as I can just go day by day slowly building up my town but not having to do everything all at once. It gives me a reason to come back every day.\r The game heavily features a brand new crafting system that use to create almost everything on the island including your own tools. This is where my first small issue is, while the crafting is fantastic and adds to the experience, the tools that you use everyday can break unlike previous Animal Crossing games and it happens enough to be tedious to have to get the supplies and then re-craft them. Also kind of sucks is accounts on the same system all have to share an island instead of getting to create their own. Online multiplayer is a bit annoying as it has a very sluggish start as you always wait a few minutes for a cut scene to play as a new person arrives and even when they are there functions are limited on the island.\r Though while these issues are certainly a pain in the butt at times it still isn't enough to deter from the lovely relaxing life simulation game that is Animal Crossing New Horizons. If you want something to just relax and play its definitely worth your time\r8/10","Great game overall, almost a 10, but bogged down slightly by the \u201c1 island per switch\u201d problem, though not directly affecting me, I know that the issue has worsened the experience for others.","Great time waster. There are some annoying stuff though like the online restricts certain tasks and animations taking too long. Just some quality of life things are missing, but overall, a good game","The game is good, but not the better animal crossing ever made, have a lot of hours of fun and it\u2019s very good","Simply incredible, i love this game, in my opinioni Is the MOST complete totale ever of the brand","Oh fun game where only one person can do any of the basic things for the game. I can't just make my own save file? Fine but at least let me do basic stuff like crafting an axe. I can't make anything besides a net and a fishing pole. I bought this game for my girlfriend and now I'm being punished for letting her play. It's the first video game she's enjoyed but now I can't even really play with her, without buying a second switch and second copy for her.","Este juego es la hostia ni caso a los que ponen 0...La mantecaAaaaaaaaaaaaa","Gran juego, excelente comunidad. Lo que m\u00e1s me gusta del juego es la interacci\u00f3n que puedo tener con todos los otros usuarios, ojal\u00e1 mi isla crezca r\u00e1pido!","not the type of game to play for long hours, enjoyed playing with my wife since it allows multiplayer using the same switch","Juego divertido, largo y profundo. Muchisimas opciones y tareas que hacer a lo largo de los dias. Se nota el mimo con que Nintendo trata la saga","I wish I had done my homework ahead of time before purchasing. Not being able to do separate islands for separate accounts is ridiculous. I have two kids that want to play and they cannot share an island where only one is allowed to make decisions. This was not well thought out for families. I wouldn\u2019t have purchased this game at all had I known.","Just bought this game with my sister. I am now a proud second-class citizen of the island of Toaster, unable to progress the story of a game I paid full price for...","The game is very lacking in content. Once you get the kk slider concert that is effectively the end of the game as far as building goes. There is nothing left to do but collect stuff. There is a huge amount of content loss between this and new leaf, with the addition of Terra forming and crafting, and the crafting system just feels like busy work so that you take a few weeks to realize how much else is missing compared to previous entries. Nintendo released an unfinished game, if they try to sell back the missing content it is scummy.","It\u2019s purely amazing I don\u2019t know what beech flooded the user reviews but this is the best game in the series by FAR","I would give this game a solid 8. The relaxing gameplay is good and the game is gorgeous. But on the execution side, that would be a generous 2! The game feels unfinished. I was hoping for way better gameplay quality from Nintendo. The main one being the multiplayer mode as many people said. I'm even more frustrated because this is a issue that designers couldn't not see. I tried mutiplayer with my girlfriend, but the feeling was really bad. And with the annoying animation each time you harvest as a companion makes you don't want to harvest anymore. On solo mode, if I harvest too much, My girlfriend will be mad because she has nothing to do and will be stuck. There are also other beginner issues. When you talk to sell or buy something, you are kicked out of the interraction and you have to retalk to the character again. Even Pokemon Red had this sort out! The wheel of tool control is bad. Aiming at fish is a pain in the ass. interractions are too long, even for a relaxing game. Finally, a little related to the multiplayer issue, the save fil management was the cue that told me that the game is unfinished. The issue is even address in the game with a animation!","Co-OP multiplayer is a HUGE disappointment.. pretty much a deal breaker for me and my wife. Hopefully Nintendo will fix this, but being essentially a bot for another player is horrible and seems like a very lazy design choice.","One island per console. Why? No other game works like this. Greedy raccoon devs are greedy. Shame on Nintendo for allowing this. I have been looking forward to starting an island for weeks while my wife played - now I never will. What folks criticizing the criticisms should recognize is that our experience of the game IS a 0 - we quite literally can't experience it as you were able to.\r The world needs better than this right now.","I love most of this game. I really do. I have had so much fun. Only allowing one island per console, though, is a bunch of sh*t. Also, I hate how the first player gets to make all the calls and make the changes. I would be fine if after we unlocked everything, the other players could go in and request new bridges or inclines, but we can't. if my wife stopped playing, I'd have to restart the f*cking game in order to do anything to the island. How stupid is that!!? I understand that they want to sell more consoles, but they could have just sold more games. We'd by 3-4 copies of the game so that we could swap out islands.","I made this account solely to write commentary on this game. Which means Nintendo really screwed up. I don\u2019t write reviews. Not yelp, not amazon, not here, not anywhere. The fact that Nintendo it deliberately restricting their fan base and clientele it atrocious. ONE island per console. Are you guys out of your mind??? Good job at  showing gratitude to the people that support your company *sarcasm*. the fact that can\u2019t even give an option to purchase access for additional islands per switch or allow more content access for a secondary player astounds me. Terrible job Nintendo. It\u2019s a nice game, but you\u2019ve seriously done yourself a disservice.","My husband and I brought this to play together, he started to play first and now I can't do a lot if he doesn't play. Now I always play on his character because mine can't do a lot. As I read in a comment, there's a dictator and a slave and it's not fun.Love the game for one, but not good for more people.","the only thing keeping me going is raymond the cat in a maid outfit pros: relaxing fun simulation. time traveling is not punishable. quirky characters. being able to build a town freely. doesn\u2019t seem like many pros but this is the entire game and what makes it fun.cons: terraforming takes so much time and precision, there is not two specific buttons for building and destroying. the music is the same loop over and over. no multi-crafting = making 60 individual fishbaits. cannot buy multiple pieces of shirts or shoes at able shop. RIDICULOUS airline dialogue that takes more time to travel.whenever someone arrives on the island, shows stupid \u201chow long it\u2019ll take for them to get here\u201d screen that interrupts EVERYBODYS gameplay. Nintendo has become greedy and requires you to have two consoles to have different islands, and rips the joy out of local play. there isn\u2019t even a bar to show how close your tool is to breaking- come on! if we\u2019re going to take inspiration from BOTW then at least implement game designs that make sense. the dialogue with the villagers feels so empty. half of the **** they do makes no sense- what about a real conversation? and for GODS sake can somebody help out with building ramps and bridges? the villagers donate three pennies to a project that costs 228,000$!!","This game is crap. No cloud saving. Weirdchamp. One island restriction. Weirdchamp. No true multiplayer. Weirdchamp. I can go on.","I don't normally post reviews, much less ones that are so negative, but the fact that you can only have one island in this game is total bs. I got this game so my household could enjoy it separately, and be able to have their own saved islands on their profile, but apparently in order to do that they would all need their own switch as well, so this was a complete waste of 60$ to me.","This game is broken. It looks really fun, however I refuse to buy it based on the fact that it limits the experience to one user. Secondary users are faced with a minimal version of the game. Horrible proprietary business move Nintendo. I won't be buying this game until this is fixed.","This game is almost unplayable as anyone other than the first person to start the game on your system.  I'm sure it's fun for them but you can not progress the story or have any impact on the game otherwise.","I really wanted to like that game, but it was just plain boring. I never played AC, I used to love the sims and generally really like cute Nintendo games, but that one just did not click.I can see the appeal for some but I just didn\u2019t  get into it, worst thing is I mostly can play at night where I can\u2019t do **** I spent 3 days in a row trying to save some money but the grinding it\u2019s just so boring, as I was about to concede to just sell some ressource at night in the mailbox shop, once again my axe broke and I was so done with this game ","I let my son play the game first I figured I could make another island... I got on and I couldn't but hey I could love his $$$$$$$$ island. I got to work paid off more than 200,000 of debt but still no other progress... I cant give bugs to tom nook... oh its because only the first person who logged on gets to play the game. On the website, you claim that up to 8 players can live and work on the island but that's a lie!! only one person can live and work on the island. they rest just live with no direction in life. NOT gonna pick up the game until u do something that allows me to take all my stuff and progress to another island. You have let me down Nintendo... if you don't make this better I don't think we can be friends...","I have 2 kids but only one can actually play the game.  The other can just follow.   There is only one island per console so only one kid\u2019s story progresses.  The other child can just follow and there are some tools they can\u2019t even get because of no story progression.  You basically need 1 console and 1 game per child.  This seems like a way for Nintendo to force people into buying extra systems and games while everyone is stuck at home due to pandemic.   Shame on you Nintendo!!!","I am long time player of animal crossing (I\u2019ve played every version of the game), and this is the worst yet. The game mechanics themselves and the new features are wonderful, but Nintendo did a terrible job when it comes to multiplayer. The way it was setup only one island is available per switch system. Who decided that was a good idea??????? Why not one island per account?!?!?! Or something that makes sense for a console. They designed the game like it was for the ds. It made sense on the ds because normally that isn\u2019t a shared console. BUT THE SWITCH IS MEANT TO BE SHARED!!!! SO WHY CAN ONLY ONE PERSON MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS?????????? A great game series with a horrible idea by Nintendo. I am very disappointed. IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED SO EVERYONE ACCOUNT HAS THEIR OWN ISLAND!!!! I WOULD GLADLY START OVER INSTEAD OF BEING UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP NINTENDO GIVES TO THE FIRST ACCOUNT THAT PLAYS THE GAME!!!!!!! FIX THIS!!!! It\u2019s the only complaint people have, it should\u2019ve been fixed by now.","Despite a few glaring flaws, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game IF you have got it for yourself. As this is not the case for every human being on our planet, the story doesn't end here:\r The fact, that you cannot have more than one island per console is definetly a deal-breaker and rather despicable. Doing so was a conscious and calculated decicion by Nintendo, considering that having more islands was possible on previous versions. Charging 60 \u20ac or whatever currency you're using is far from okay and nothing but a shameless cash-grab. I do think that Nintendo deserves significant hate for their decicion and also think that my score is justified for this reason: A game, that forces family members to be some kind of slaves to whoever happened to start the game, does not deserve any rating above five and considering that there are many other things (visiting friends is difficult, villager dialogue is repetitive) I will not be ashamed of considering this to be a bad game overall.","If you have multiple people in your home, you'll need another console to have their own island. I didn't know Nintendo was turning into EA but this is bulls**t.","Very sad to find out the second player is like a slave for the first player. I have to stop playing until this gets fixed. Really disappointed.","My brother and I were super excited for this game, until we bought it and found out we would not be able to have our own islands. You may say that we should\u2019ve known this before purchasing, but the Switch has multiple profiles, therefore leading us to believe we could have multiple save files, just like every other Switch game. We now share a character in order for us to both share Resident Representative duties, but we would much rather have our own personal islands. We are very disappointed that Nintendo would do such a greedy thing in order to sell more consoles.","0 for forcing players to share an island for no other reason than to encourage multiple console purchases. games have had multiple save file slots for virtually all of gaming history. there is no explanation other than greed.","There are 4 of us in our household. Only 1 can play the game. Absolute garbage.","Overall the game is fun and enjoyable. If you were to play the game for 20 minutes a day and didn't care about multiplayer features, local or online, then you could probably enjoy the game. However, the game is bogged down with hundreds of tiny flaws that combine to create an overall frustrating experience. With each new Switch game that releases it becomes increasingly more apparent that Nintendo simply doesn't understand how to design a game or what their players want. Nintendo is worse than EA because at least EA games aren't $60 seven years after release. Nintendo can't deliver what its players want in a game. They keep releasing titles with the philosophy of \"we know best,\" and it doesn't lead to fun gameplay.","Please fix the profile and save issues and i will immediately change this to a 10.","Unable to visit other people\u2019s islands.  I get some kind of error it won\u2019t let me visit friend\u2019s islands and they can\u2019t come to mine.   This was marketed as a social experience and I can\u2019t engage with the one feature I bought the game for.  Nintendo won\u2019t allow a refund, BUYER BEWARE!!!","One island, one switch... Fine. I guess me and my girlfriend can have a cute co-op experience. Oh what's that? I can't progress the game unless my girlfriend continues for me? Why?","Dude you can\u2019t sell a game for $60 and lock the full experience to one player. Nintendo continues to be incompetent with every decision they make. Online for the Switch is still garbage, we have to download an app for voice chat, up until recently Nintendo would charge for you to use their content online (something other, smarter gaming companies see as essential to the community, as well as, ya know, free advertisement) and now one of their flagship games limits the user experience to one person. It\u2019s 2020. It\u2019s time to get with the times Nintendo. Stop limiting us..","If you are the first person is great, but if you want to share it with your family is awful. The main person gets all the missions and tools, but the others cannot help you with another account. Really bad!","Disgraceful that if you want a 2nd island for someone else to have their own save game you have to buy a 2nd console - this is EA levels of daylight robbery. Sort it out Nintendo!!!!!","Don\u2019t buy if you want to play with more than 1 person. Trash experience as second player","When did Nintendo go from family friendly to mobile game devs level of scum? This game makes it so obvious that Nintendo is blatantly out to sell consoles. Every fan boy that falls for this is just making it the new standard. I'm sorry, but it's impossible to make such well put together, polished games, and have such thoughtless designs smack you at every turn without them being there on purpose. Animal crossing is built specifically to be as frustrating and restricted as possible to waste your time all while holding a better way to play behind a second console. I will NEVER support this kind of BS but sadly there are more suckers that will so you can bet things will only get worse.","My wife loves this game and I was super excited to find out that it had multiplayer so that my children could play together and my wife and I could.  However, I downloaded the game today and my frustration has risen many times.  First, only ONE island is allowed on the console.  What the what?!  I want to make my own design decisions and have my wife do hers and look at how things pan out.  NOPE.  Second, the first person who plays gets to make ALL important decisions, where buildings go, the shape of the island, etc.  Third, couch coop multiplayer forces only one person to be able to do worthwhile activity leaving the other players to weed and water.  This could be looked over and wouldn't even be a complaint IF we could have our own islands.  I would prefer this setup, IF we had our own islands.\r If you plan on buying this game for multiple people to play, then please stop and consider these things.  I may not have purchased this game if I had known this before hand.  The video reviews I watched never brought this up.  This could have easily been a 9 or 10 if they hadn't stupidly forced people into a single way of playing.  I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY!  Okay, so, I'm obvioulsy frustrated, but I do hope this helps you understand what you might face if you buy this.","This is essentially a one player game. Everyone else is just along for the ride as glorified visitors. Unacceptable","Got this for my wife and I. I didn\u2019t know that only one of us could make any decisions in the game so I guess it\u2019s just for her now. Would be nice to play together but what\u2019s the point when I can\u2019t do anything interesting. Thanks Nintendo. I remember when you made good co-op games.","I was under the assumption we could have multiple islands on one console, had somebody told me you COULDN'T we would NOT have bought it. If they update it to hold multiple islands id gladly change my review. 0/10","The fact that they only allow one island per console is idiotic. I'm not going go buy a second switch and a second copy just so my wife and I can play on different islands. Sharing an island between multiple accounts is horrible for personal gameplay and extremely limiting to anyone who starts playing after the first account starts the island.","Thinking that given the fact that it is the year of our Lord 2020 and surely not even Nintendo can be so achaic that it will be like the Gamecube version and you can only have 1 island per CONSOLE? Thinking about having a personal experience when more then/than 1 person is going to play the game? Thinking no company could be so out of touch that the previous 2 statements  could have an answer that defies all logic? WRONG!!!\r It is in fact, just like the Gamecube version.","Les restrictions d\u00e9sesp\u00e8rent tout le monde de jouer. Il faudrait cr\u00e9er un mode pour avoir plusieurs \u00eeles","A game geared towards being family-friendly doesn't allow each family member to experience the intended fun of creating their own island. Very trashy of Nintendo to do something like this. Doesn't matter how cute and fun the game is, the foundation is flawed and ruins everything built on it.","I\u2019m beyond frustrated with this game, this is the first animal crossing I ever play, I know the new leaf players had it worst but this stressed me out.I bought this game because everyone was raving about how awesome and relaxing it is, knowing we were going to be on lockdown I thought this was the perfect game for this! I\u2019ve clocked many hours on stardew valley so I thought this was right up my alley, but it\u2019s not.The first days were very entertaining, everything is new and you feel progress in the course of the initial settlement of your very own island where you are the representative! But slowly but surely you become what you are escaping from in reality, just an employee, in this case, an employee of Tom nook.You want a bridge? Pay upYou want a ramp? Pay upYou want to relocate a building? Pay upMore storage? Pay upAnother room? Pay upTravel to random islands? Pay up Furniture? Pay upClothing? Pay upEven the things you do daily consist on a exchange of currency, if you want to relocate a tree, you have to consume fruit to be able to relocate it, your tools break so you have to constantly get materials to craft them again.And every time you move 1 ramp, one bridge or one building it takes 1 whole real life day, yeah, it won\u2019t be finished until 5 am the next day, 1 ramp/bridge per day, if you want to destroy and build another bridge (you can\u2019t relocate them, you have to pay again) you have to wait til the day after tomorrow! On the positive side the game looks gorgeous, there is an IMMENSE amount of items, furniture, clothing, wallpapers, floors etc The art of the game is impecable.But the problem is that this is a game of collecting items and decorating, it may not be for everyone, there\u2019s not much to do story-wise after you finish paying the 5 rooms you can expand on your home and achieve a 3 rating star on your island , so you are left with decorating and collecting items, and that\u2019s it, a beautiful shell of a game with no much gameplay but shake trees and mine ores.Also, you can\u2019t build more than 8 ramps in your island, you can\u2019t build ramps next to another, you can\u2019t build a ramp that leads straight to your museum because they are made of 2 blocks and the museum is 5 blocks wide, the lack of symmetry on some parts makes me irrationally mad. The cherry on top is that you can only have 1 island per switch, the dialog is very unintuitive and the online functionality is ok but a pain if you have more than 2-3 visitors with unnecessary repetitive loading animations.","The choice to make the island binded to the SWITCH instead of the profile is unaccettable. The players 2+ are simply guest, they can't do any decision on the island, can't build any new building and can't make decisions on new guests. It's a dull and boring gameplay that strike every family member that doesn't create the island! Really short sighted! Will change my vote if they will fix. Sign the petition: https://www.change.org/p/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-shouldn-t-restrict-to-one-island-per-console","Why is no one talking about how they only put it for Nintendo switch,I was so excited for the game to come but now I'm so sad because I can't buy a Nintendo switch, besides ac has always been for Nintendo 3DS,they could put it for both Nintendo's.","The game looks fun to play and I bought it for my gf. Now I want to join as well but learning that I cannot have my own island without getting a new switch is absolutely unacceptable. What an absolutely greed fueled money grab. Both parties involved should be ashamed of themselves","1, as in the number of islands you can have per console. Such a shame this is a thing.","The game only allows ONE ISLAND per switch console. This means I can't truly play the game, as my wife made an account first. Now I am just a side character, and whats more we have to split all the resources on the island. This was a terrible cash grab. We are not made of money and can't just afford to buy two switches for no reason. Nintendo is GREEDY. I don't think I'll be buying any Nintendo products anytime soon, seeing as they will likely have ridiculous cash grabs built into them as well.","Can only have one island per Switch. Bad multiplayer design on a Switch with multiple users.","NINTENDO! FIX THIS! This one island deal is an outrage. Can anyone tell me of another game that has ever done this? Sorry but I'm not buying a second switch so that my wife can play this game for like two months and then wait for the next bandwagon game to catch on.","The policy of one island per Switch console is an inexcusable deal breaker for any family with more than one family member, or for that matter for any person wanting to re-play the game for a different experience at a later time without deleting old saves. Bad excuses of anti cheating or whatever are just red herrings, since such measures can be implemented in other ways without breaking the game. It is obvious this is just a cheap way of Nintendo forcing the players to buy more consoles.","Nintendo games are really going down hill and the problem is the fact that people are buying there games due to nostalgia before there parents where divorced. Pocket camp is a better game then what i waited all these years for. The animals have no personality of their own and the online system is absolutely garbage. the only way you should see the plane is when its local play is being used after that it is just bad coding like it was coded to be this bad.  i give it a 5 because i did have a bit of fun but beyond that i think this is just Nintendo being lasy af and just riding us out on nostalgia.","I don't understand why this game is so highly praised, after about a month of owning it I can say its 'just okay'.\r When you start the game, you're drawn in by the charm of the character designs and the laid back feeling. You aren't pressed for time and can do what you want. I spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum, creating my own house and trying to make money.\r However, I then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing.\rYou need allot of money to progress in this game, so you're going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell. Once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade (progress in the game, essentially) so you'll have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again.\r This isn't just limited to the main game either, filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils (you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you've found before).\r The character dialogue? repeating. You start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing, and while that may be fine normally this is a game that's supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed 'small details' and charm, which I found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me. This game is essentially a one trick pony, after the initial 'wow' there's not much left to be impressed by.\r Its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition, its more like a chore than a fun game.\r I can't really recommend this game, its not the worst game I've ever played, but its just dreadfully boring.","Bought this game to play with my wife as it is supposed to support local coop. Not only the local coop is a joke as the player who is not the leader basically can't to anything but if you're not the first player to run the game and be the representative you won't get to actually play the game.\rNow I still don't have a game to play with my wife as she is the only one who can play it.","Can't actually play the game because I wasn't the first player to play it.Will need to spend another \u00a3300 on a switch to be able to do any of the story.Ridiculously greedy by Nintendo.","Bought this for my girlfriend who has really been enjoying it.  However, recently we both thought it would be fun for me to make an island on my account too and were dismayed to find out that there is a one island limit per switch.This is a very questionable design choice and seems borderline predatory as an attempt to pressure families into buying multiple switch consoles.","Everyone seems to be complaining about the '1 island per console' problem, which is frustrating, but since I have no one to share my console with I don't have that problem. What I do have a problem with is the game itself, it's way too grindy and doesn't offer me a 'relaxing' experience like others claim. I find myself actually getting stressed more because I can't find the materials I need to proceed, for example, 30 iron nuggets to build the shop. There are 3 stones on my island and not 1 gave me an iron nugget, meaning I have to constantly spend Nook Miles to go to other islands so I can get them, it took me multiple days just to complete that task due to bad RNG. And don't get me started on the 3 plot stuff...6 items per plot, and some of the materials needed for said items I cannot get on my island at all, which means MORE grinding for Nook Miles to travel to other islands for them to potentially not even have the materials I need. I just want to be able to have villagers on my island without having to constantly grind.\r I'll give it to Nintendo that the animal residents are adorable. It's why I was dragged to the game in the first place, which looking back was a huge mistake. With all the content it has, I can see why it's being sold for \u00a350, but the gameplay itself doesn't make up for it. If you want a game like Minecraft that has cute, interactive animal villagers and 10x more grinding for materials, then this game is absolutely for you. But sadly, it was not for me at all.","I\u2019ve bought this game for playing solo, and seeing how pretty much everyone enjoys it that way, I thought I would too. And to my disappointment, it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing.\rSome of the aspects that killed the game for me:\r 1. Grind. I initially expected the game to be kind of similar to Stardew Valley. There, you were always rewarded for everything: catching new species, donating items to the museum, talking and giving gifts to the villagers (aka getting cutscenes and gifts).\rWhat is the situation like in ACNH? Want to travel to mystery islands (actually a one very cool feature), want some cool hairstyles? You gotta get nook miles. And in order to get them, you\u2019re given the most enjoyable tasks ever imaginable: chop 10 trees, catch 10 bugs, sell 20 weed. It was getting so tedious I wanted to CRY. People actually spend 60$ on this and enjoy it??\r Museum is actually really beautiful on the inside, I did not expect it at first. But the sensation wears off real quick, because essentially it\u2019s all this game is about - looks. Nothing rewarding in terms of gameplay.\r 2. Villagers. Again, can be pretty, but they all have the same cookie cutter cutter cute and lovely personality. Maybe it\u2019s me who\u2019s got so unlucky, i don\u2019t know. But you can develop even characters like this, but all I got is some copy paste bs monologue about how that one likes to sleep and eat, and that other one likes to lift weights. Amazing.\r 3. The time you have to spend to do such routine like buying or selling. Like honestly, do I REALLY need  to stop to read greetings every time I walk into the shop, followed by ANOTHER line when I try to talk to them?? To then watch how my character hands them the goods, and they talk pointlessly??\rOptimize the menus for god\u2019s sake and stop making everything so slow. You can make immersive game without trying to artificially drag out things like selling, buying and crafting, especially when you\u2019re doing it so frequently...\r 4. It was actually partially my fault for not reading about the game enough, but real time synchronization is stupid. You want to build a home, a bridge, or literally anything? Wait for one day. Want to see new clothes? Wait one day. Want to have fun right now? Unlucky for you, wait one day.\rI could get behind this idea if it wouldn\u2019t have hindered me from doing what I want when I want. Why can\u2019t I move quickly with the game if I want to? Why is this game forcing one play style on everyone?\r I know you can time travel, which I usually do, even though it kinda feels like cheating. And you know why? Because if you do that, it\u2019s extremely apparent that the game relies on that real time gimmick to be interesting. It severely lacks any real content.\rI believe you will enjoy the ACNH if you like customizing stuff, because it\u2019s one thing the game is objectively good at.\r All in all,  I really, REALLY tried to like this game. But you can only catch bugs for so long.","I spent 60 e on the game and also had to buy a memory card to be able to download it. Now it turned out that only one profile can own an island and others are just guests. So now I have one happy kid and one sad. I\u2019m very disappointed at Nintendo. They better fix it. It\u2019s 2020 \u2013 there surely aren\u2019t any technical restrictions preventing each profile from having an own island.","This is a review that comes from a secondary user of the game.While the game in itself is fantastic, peaceful and brilliant. I have never been more disappointed by a game. This probably comes as my partner and I were excited for this game to come out for a long time. The unfortunate truth is that you  cannot create multiple island for multiple users. This is absolutely disappointing as it shows how much Nintendo wants people to buy more of its products. I have never given a review before and I am extremely sadden by the fact the developers completely ruined the game for me as I cannot have my own story, my own adventure. It only leaves a bitter feeling in your mouse...","I really liked the overall game but I just can't get past the game only having one island per console. I'd be totally fine with sharing the island with my kid if both of us could complete main story quests but only the first player to establish the island gets to progress the story. So even though I created my own character on the same island,  all I can do is collect things and wait for the first player to eventually progress the island. It makes it where I don't even want to play anymore because what is the point? Just a terribly stupid choice from Nintendo that will probable turn me off these games for good.","PLEASE please please add more custom design slots. This limitation is MAJORLY affecting my enjoyment of the game, and will be the reason I stop playing. I can't continue to customize my island without a LOT more design slots. They fill up so fast and if i delete one to add another, the design changes in the game. I have stalled out on game play and the only enjoyable part left is customization and now I can't continue that either.","This review would basically be the same as the other negative review on here, so just read the majority of them. To put my on review though I would say this game is good, I've so far enjoyed my experience and that's as a solo player even then I'm disappointed in the solo save feature, I've seen that apparently having 8 people on one island is \"multiple saves\" but that isn't true, that's one save for multiple people. I can see that critic reviews are positive and I can only imagine that they won't actually play this game like most intend or like family with one console for the family. Silly idea for a brilliant game, and all for the money. Very sad.","This game har AMAZING potential but the experience is absolutely 100% ruined for a couple who shares one switch, solely because of the 1 island per console combined with the RIDICULOUS second resident restrictions. I would accept the fact that we have to share one island together but not the fact that 2nd player doesnt get to play the game. Either we  should be able to have seperate islands for each user or let all residents have full access to the shared island!","So, I bought this game specifically because it stated it was 1 - 2 players on the box. To my disappointment, it is NOT 2 players. It is 1 Player with a helper. I really like the game, but that was a clear case of false advertising, and the company should be sued. The first player to start the game chooses the island that everyone local will be \"playing\" on. The first player is the ONLY player who gets to choose where the new residents go. They are the only player that can trigger main events to progress the story. Only one player can visit other islands at a time, you can't go together. All of the main events can only be triggered by the first player. The first player is the only one who can choose where bridges and ramps get placed. On top of this, other accounts on the switch can NOT create their own island, they are stuck being helpers on this one island, so forget buying this game for the family, it was a waste of money. Multiplayer games are not new, split screen is not new, so do the decision makers for this game have their heads in the sand? Next time hire people who know what they're doing when making multiplayer games.","Being limited to a single island ruins this game.  I shouldn't ever even have to wonder if a game can be played with different accounts.  It's common sense.  I just bought a switch, which was a horrible experience with the current stock shortage, specifically so my wife and I can each play this game, have our own islands, and share our individual experiences.  My jaw is still laying on the floor after learning that you are stuck with a single island that all users must share.  I'm not even given the (bad) option of buying a second copy of the game to open up the option for a 2nd island.  This is an awful, awful design decision.  If the motivation is to stop cheating, first of all, why would the devs care if somebody is cheating at a single player life simulator?  Ruining the experience for multiple players within the household only creates a bigger problem.  Until this game is patched with a reasonable option for individual players on the same console to have their own individual experiences, this game is worthless to me and many others.  The entire premise of this game is having YOUR own island and making it YOURS.  This is a horrible, horrible move that needs fixed immediately.","I really like this game, and personally for myself alone it's a 10/10. But the fact that my roomate can't play the game at all mean's it's a very valid 0. I've read people saying that a 0 is non nonsensical, However, this is a game play rating, and this setup allows for literally 0 game for him to play. How is that not a 0? Roaming around my island with nothing to do is not a game, it's an interactive museum at best (coincidentally, this game has an amazing museum set up!).\r I digress, assuming you're actually able to play it, it's a very good game. Super fun to build up an island, collecting artifacts is surprisingly fun! I'm in the end game and having the ability to terraform is amazing! I love creating things, and hunting for bugs and fish! I also love visiting friends (outside my own household) islands and snagging fruits I don't have.\r Any who, if there is a 1:1:1 ratio between people who are going to be playing, game cartridges owned, and game consoles owned. I HIGHLY suggest it, especially if you have friends who play it. If that ratio is off, there's no way I can suggest it. It's too good to not be able to share fully.","I (mostly) thoroughly enjoy this game but am getting increasingly frustrated with some of the mechanics. The biggest ones are of course the 1 island rule which is honestly INSANE to me. But I also find the design downloader quite annoying. Why can't I edit designs I download? Even if I copy then? Makes no sense. The crafting gets really monotonous because you have to do it one at a time and I would love to see you be able to craft using your storage inventory","Pretty short sighted and money hungry to force households to have 1 island per console. Every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves except this one. Just shows Nintendo is no better than the rest of the shady AAA gaming industry.","Locked to a single island per console in a disgusting money grabbing attempt from Nintendo. Also a stupid game in general- who likes doing chores to get out of debt from a raccoon? Plebians.","This game would be a 10 but there is one huge flaw. Nintendo refuses to let you have a different island per user. And will require you to purchase another console. This, paired with the lack of cloud saves is a very scummy choice by Nintendo. Other than that good game but the anticonsumerist approach to this release, especially when consoles are incredibly difficult to get ahold of, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and I cant recommend for those reasons alone","If you have more than 1 person in your house, don't bother buying this game. You can only have 1 island per switch. Very, very hard to enjoy the game at the beginning. Not being able to skip cut-scenes and skip dialogue kills me. If you do have to share an island, the person who didn't make the island doesn't have control over anything. You pretty much just gather resources. Very disappointed that such a promising game was ruined by Nintendo being petty and greedy. Will never play again.","The local co-op is an absolute joke. Also, if you're not the first player to create a character on the island, you're pretty much shafted. You will have NO way of progressing through the story or make changes to the island. There's not even a way to make multiple islands on the same switch. Basically, if you aren't player one, this game is completely unplayable","Compre el juego para jugar con mi novio, resulta que solo el usuario principal disfruta de todo y hace crecer la isla. Me parece una estafa gigante. Estoy muy disconforme con la compra.","The one island per switch, rather than one island per profile is a terrible, terrible design decision from Nintendo. I cannot see how it is anything more than a poorly disguised attempt to force people to buy a second switch console.","LET ME HAVE MY OWN ISLAND. I don't want to be on my girlfriend's island. I want the grind to be mine and mine alone. What a waste of money. I Will never play this game if I can do everything on my own","Game is sort of fun if you don't plan on sharing. One island per console is ridiculous. Goals get old and seem mundane. Other than making your house bigger and earning money, there's no clear direction. Seems exactly like all other AC games that came before, no real improvements or anything game changing.","The limitation to one island per Switch breaks completely the game if there is more than one player, the second player is too limited and will not enjoy the game in most cases.","The game is fun and relaxing but the one island per console set up is going to cause me a divorce. I played the game first without realizing my wife would be a completely second class citizen on my island.  Basically all the decisions get made by me and she can\u2019t participate in the story at all. Really upsetting. It\u2019s a great game but honestly if two people in your family want to play it it\u2019s not worth it.","Yea, yea, I know. Please read fully, I promise not to be the typical bad review, though, I have the rating so low for the same reasons. I have always seen Nintendo as a family connecting platform. Some of my fondest memories are playing Mario kart, super smash, and Wii sports on the Wii. My sister got a switch for her birthday and I never really thought much of it. But when New horizons released she was eager to let me jump in. I have never played animal crossing, but this was outstandingly a great experience, I fell in love. But I struggled to help her build homes, and wasn't treated the same, nor did I interact with importance with Tom, I felt discriminated against. I soon learned why, with the one island per console, and the founder having all the decision making, really, really, really sucked. I would have loved to then start my own island, or co-run the one we were in. I couldn't choose where buildings went, I couldn't progress, and I couldn't even invite villagers, one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the entire game! I was stuck, and worst of all... This literally damaged my relationship with my sister. I'm twice her age and I felt we finally found a way to bond, but no, Nintendo turned from a \"family connecting\" idea, to a \"family tearing\" nightmare. I absolutely hate it, and I can't play it anymore, and that has led my sister to stop, and now I feel guilty, and everything is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. How could a overly family friendly game turn into a despair-enducing experience. However, it's still a 4 because if you were solo this game is absolutely perfect, but this game is built around socializing and family, and it decided it wanted to ruin both. If you want to play with anymore then a SINGLE person, which is what was frost attractive about the game, then DON'T BUY.NINTENDO... Please, I beg you to rethink your decision. Make multiple islands where others can found, or make a co-founder system where both share absolutely the SAME privileges.Love this game, but hate it too.","This is my first AC so I can't compare it to the previous ones, but I like this game a lot so far. I wasn't sure what was interesting about it before. But I know it now, I've been playing every day since I bought it, because I have to save bells and remake the whole island lol I'm sure you'd enjoy it more if you had a friend to play with. But I think you'll enjoy it for the time being, even on your own.","Cuando era m\u00e1s ni\u00f1o me encantaba la saga, respeto que a mucha gente le guste y tambi\u00e9n que la prensa y los fans lo valoren, pero lo veo sobrevalorado m\u00e1s de la cuenta, ahora lo veo con otros ojos o mis gustos cambiaron, con los marios me acab\u00f3 pasando lo mismo ( son m\u00e1s de lo mismo pero con mejores gr\u00e1ficos).","If you didn't create the island you are absolutely barred by the first resident's progress.","Bad controls, excessive dialogue, and encourages cheating! Not a good example for kids.This game is not family friendly. No one has their own game and they all get angry at any little thing others do. I\u2019ve had to remove the game for both our systems. That\u2019s what $800 for two games and systems for four kids! They aren\u2019t allowed to use them handheld or the systems would be broken by now. I\u2019ve played with them up to today and I loved it. But all the negativity and hate this game creates is insane. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Personally I would love to get myself a system and transfer my first island to it as I was the creator and get some handles for the kids. But I can\u2019t transfer at all. I really hope Nintendo doesn\u2019t think sale numbers mean they made a good game.","AWESOME GAME! GOTY 2020! But nintendo done bad stuff here.\rI'm ok with 1 island per console. I bought game and let my girlfriend play it on my console. After some time, I wanted to buy her a Switch light with her own copy of game, bc she plays it alot and really likes the game and I want my island too.\rBut guess what? You CANT TRANSFER THE DAMN ISLAND ON ANOTHER SWITCH!\rNintendo, I want to give you my money for another console and another game. But you litteraly dont let me do that, because 1 simple thig: island transfer not allowed.\rTime traveling? Yeah!\rCheating? Yeah!\rPlayers selling items for real money? YEAH!\rTransfer save? NONONONO U CANT!!!\rWTF, Nintendo?\rI'll rate this game 10 if this issue will be fixed. PLEASE LET SAVE TRANSFER AND TAKE MY MONEY FOR ANOTHER CONSOLE AND COPY OF GAME!!!!","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL PLAY ITMy girlfriend bought the game for us BOTH to play. Every other game pretty much in existence allows you to have your own individual game on your separate account. However with this one you can only have one island per CONSOLE basically making the second person unable to play.  She did not pay $60 for this.  Now I feel awful because my girlfriend really wanted to play but I was the first one to start up the game.  The greed is unreal.  I guess Nintendo wants people to have to go out and buy another console. NOT HAPPENING.  In fact I'm going back to just sticking with the PS4.  I hope Nintendo reconsiders otherwise they've lost a lot of future customers. Oh and for those saying review bombing isn't okay, obviously they are the only ones in their household. The rest of us got screwed and the rating is fair and justified","VERY disappointed by the fact only one person can get the full game experience. Bought this for my girlfriend only to find out later that I\u2019m unable to do any of the activities her character is able to. I can only imagine the poor family that bought this for their two or more children only to find out that 1 of them will get a much better experience than the others. That\u2019ll be a fun household to be in for a few days.  Whether this is a terrible design decision, a terrible profit motivated decision, or a terrible underestimation of how people like to share their experiences, it\u2019s, well, terrible.  Incidentally, if you asked my girlfriend, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019d rate it a lot higher. Know why? She\u2019s allowed to get the full experience! Turns out if you only let people play half the game, they only like it half as much.","I'm extremely disappointed that a family/shared system would limit the amount of islands to a console. Cheers. I've lost interest. It won't be in my household.","Super annoyed and kinda angry! Just purchased this game for $80 and found out multiple people cannot have their own island! Only 1 island per switch not user!  Massive downfall of the game THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!","I thought it was a great game and spent hours and hours building my island up to my Specification, halfway through I have found there is a limit to my features needed to complete it, such as inclines and bridges. I am very angry and after spending so much time and effort to get to this point I honestly just want to put down the game and never play it again.","It was fun when I started but it gets SOOOO boring catching bugs and fishes and then you get barely any money.","Yes the game is fun until you are blocked because you are the number 2 player on your switch and the first player don't have time to play and continue the story of the game. Why could I not build bridges, buildings... ?! Just because I started to play later ! If you share a switch, don't play this game, you can have fun for 1-2 wekks ubtil you are blocked and cannot do anything with the island because you are not the first player.","A fun game at first, but after some time into the game.. it became boring. Boring in terms of the frustration u get in the game. 1) fishing - these fish will let u know what frustration are - sea bass, black bass2) i have visit lots of mystery islands, and the fruit ii get is (other than my default fruit - pear) apples.. and thats it.. nothing else. For flower, for mystery tour, i get only cosmos (default flower) and pansies.......3) got excited in subscribing to nintendo online, hoping at least trade with those fruit i wanted, well.. Nooooo, i got no chance.. tried visiting friends.. guess what.. connection not established bcos of the stupid NAT issue.Only good are, character design and graphics.","New Horizons is so close to being an amazing game, but Nintendo's shortcomings, oversight, or negligent understanding of the modern game environment means the game falls short. The game is pretty, polished, and cute. However it feels like a relic of the past. The major shortcoming of ACNH is how the game plays when trying to play with friends. There is nothing to do with your friends. You cannot build things together. You cannot paint together, decorate together, or even use basic terminal functions when someone is on your island. You can't sell things on a friends island if you are playing too late at night. if someone tries to come to your island they will not be able to if you have a dialog box open. When a person comes everyone involved will have to wait through a lengthy loading screen. If anyone disconnects everyone's progress will be lost. These issues make no sense in today's video game landscape, no other large release has these problems. I want to love this game. It is beautiful. But the actual act of playing the game with my significant other, the reason i bought it, is near unbearable tedium.","Stupid only one island per console. I am paying familiar switch online, because all family is using the console. Why only one island???","One island per device?  Deal breaker.  How can this be a family game when only one of my kids can truly play it?","I would love this game ... if I was the one who actually got to play it. It was supposed to be a fun and relaxing game during quarantine that instead turned into a domestic dispute because I failed to do the research that only ONE user gets to have an island and every other user gets to be a second class citizen on said island. I bought the game but my roommate played it before I had the chance to and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. I just get to be the jerk who\u2019s bad at sharing, when really there is absolutely no reason why Nintendo can\u2019t allow for separate islands for separate user profiles. Heck, I\u2019d buy a separate copy of the game to have my own island if that would solve it. But my roommate isn\u2019t going to buy her own Switch, so I\u2019m just stuck being the angry jerk who wasted $60. Do better, Nintendo.","I got so frustated when I found out about the one island per console thingy, me and my brother were so exited to play that game, scince he's the principal acount I just feel kinda useless being in the game","Tldr: 2 stars because I LOVE this game, but the deal breaker of a problem I have with it could have easily been prevented with just the tiniest bit of forethought and whatever short amount of time it would have taken to add a warning message at startup of the game. Don't start playing on a shared device!I've been obsessed with this game since I started playing a little over a week ago. I'd never even touched my husband's switch before, or another Animal Crossing game, so I had no idea that when he added me as a second player I would basically get to play one tenth of the actual game. It's probably a little dramatic, but I was devastated when I realized that I would never be able to progress the game on my own just because my husband made his account first. I really don't care about buying another console/game to have my own island, but the thought of doing that now after all of the effort/hours I've already put into the game makes me think I'm just going to give it up entirely. I really wish that at the very, very least there had been a warning when setting up an additional player on the game so I could have just bought a second switch before I got so far into it. This is the only problem I've found with the game, but it's a deal breaker to me and apparently a lot of other ACNH players. I've seen quite a few good suggestions of how to fix this, including adding the ability to switch between designated primary players or allowing the data to be transferred to another device via the  cloud storage. If you're going to make people buy multiple devices &amp; games, don't pour salt in the wound by wasting their time too. Please warn future players in advance of what to expect as player 2+.","Would love to write a review if I could play it! One island per Switch.. at a time where we are stuck at home, lost jobs and all, being forced to purchase multiple switches and games per household is not feasible. Been a fan of Nintendo since the 80's, but now my money will be going elsewhere because this is low.","Not allowing multiple islands per Switch is really a horrible move. Consider families with multiple children, they will not be able to play the game separately. And no, not everyone can afford a Switch per child. Horrible design choice, and completely unnecessary.","This video game could be so much more...but it's not. If you have kids that want to play this game dont even think about considering putting any actual serious time into it, as you can only have 1 island per switch. So everyone in your family has to live on the same island. It has now become their game because I dont even want to play it anymore. Everyt ime I play I have to fix the damage the kids have done. Also I wanted to play with my fiance, but 2 player sucks. He doesnt want to play because I have already progressed so now he can't experience it from the beginning. Also when we wanted to play together the 2nd player cant do **** He was literally almost falling asleep because he just had to follow me around.Plus when the animals talk they say the same thing every time each time you go see them.. this is very annoying and time consuming actually.If you live by yourself and solely play single player it would be a great game. But in my situation I give it 1 star...","The Good: Literally everything except...The Bad: This has sparked actual screaming *fights* in my household because of the one island per Switch deal. Sharing is not usually difficult for us and my family shares the Switch all the time with other games. Watching someone play when it's their turn is fun to do. But one person getting creative license over a single island per Switch and not per account? What did you think was going to happen, Nintendo? Peace? Do you all live alone or do you think we all are going to shell out a couple thousand just to keep fights from breaking out over a bridge being erected or a beloved/bemoaned villager being ousted/invited? The game is meant to be a relaxing escape and it is... until the Island Rep breaks out Lloid to build an expensive incline to a cliff that goes nowhere or thinks it'd be hilarious to send Sprinkle packing because she's the villager someone else likes best.It's a 5 star game. It gets 3 for literally inciting days long fueds. Days. Fix the single island thing, even if it means buying another cartridge or memory card like we did to get around this in previous versions. People will throw $60 at you five times for each family member to have their own control of their own island on the same console if you'd just let them. We'll do it. We clearly love this game franchise.","the first 2 months or so of playing this is pretty fun, but once you complete the minimal content that the game offers it becomes extremely boring to play. if you're planning on buying this game, I recommend to wait until it has enough content. also if you're looking to buy this to play with your kids or something of that caliber, do not because it turns out the first person to boot up the game on their nintendo switch profile is in control of the island and the rest that boot the game up on their profile are barred from most of the content. other than that, pretty fun game.","So, I have never played a game of this genre before. And having bought it during the height of the coronavirus, it became a great entertainment.\r But as soon as the epidemic subsided and there was an opportunity to meet friends, the game lost some of its appeal - communication with the inhabitants of the island.\r All that remains of the game is endless customization. Some people like it, but I soon got bored.","Is the worst game ive ever play dont have any sense in 2020 exist this things is like a Tamagotchi from 1990","Expensive **** \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u0443 \u043e\u043a, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u041a, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 - \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e, \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442","I started playing this game with no expectations, as i never played any of its predecessors. 300 hours later and I can't stop.

Already played 250 hrs or more and I intend to keep on playing for a very long time.","I can definitely agree that the one island per console is a poor decision. My five year old loves this game and that can make sharing an island difficult, but not completely awful (though I'd still prefer we each had our own island). The real time pacing also sets this game back. Not everyone wants to wait 24 real hours to construct a tiny piece of your island or move one building and other assorted tiny bits of progress. Otherwise this is still a pretty fun game.","I have \"finished the main story\"  if you can say that.\rFirst time playing a Anaimal crossing game, and i was captivated the first couple of days. But it ended up feeling like another free to play games that you play on your phone and come back everyday to complete tasks. Except this game cost 449DKK when i bought the game \u2026","Para algunos puede ser que les guste la isla des\u00e9rtica ya que te da libertad de hacer lo que quieras y construir tus cosas donde quieras. Pero a mi eso no me acaba de gustar del todo. Os explico, al principio esta bien ya que contruyes tus cosas y eso, pero con el paso del tiempo se vuelve mon\u00f3tono y aburrido ya que no tienes misiones y has remodelado la isla como quieres. Los otros animal crossing  puede que no te dieran tantas libertades pero ten\u00edan m\u00e1s eventos, personajes, actividades y ambiente.","A large number of collection elements and beautiful islands with changing day and night, weather and seasons form the base of this game, and the behavioral design of the rich and varied animal villagers makes the player no longer lonely, greatly enhancing the player's sense of agency, sense of mission, and making the island full of life. The game gives players different goals in the short and medium term, as well as well-designed incentives of different levels and frequencies to ensure the player's attention. In addition, the game is designed with considerable restraint in terms of the resources given to the player, which ensures that the game is fresh for long periods of time, even in single player mode. All in all, this is a game that allows the player to self-actualize step by step, always making additions.","It's a fun game. The only flaw is the 1 island only policy but overall, the game is best on what it has to offer.","The game is beautiful, but the lack of objectives and the fact that you have to wait a whole day for certain thing makes it feel like a mobile game instead of a triple A experience.Although  I really enjoyed visiting other islands and the clothing  customization.","This is my first AC game.  It's an adorable, relaxing game.  I love setting up my island as I want it, and I love finding my ideal villagers to come live with me.  The biggest issues I have with this game are:\r 1. Terrible UI designed to make you take the maximum number of clicks to do any single action\r 2. After you've set up your island.. there's really nothing else to do. It's really not a very replayable game.\r It's fun while it lasted, but probably not the kind of game I'll play over and over again.","The multiplayer  part of the game needs to be better. I think everyone should be like the leader and everyone should have the same DIYs. I would also like it if every account had their own island.","ONE ISLAND? SERIOUSLY? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Fuk","Initially I didn't think I'd like this game and waited until July 2020 to start playing after my brother and nephew gave it high marks.  To me it sounded too much like Minecraft--an exercise in tedium.  Fortunately there is much more going on here, to me.  Already the game is quite addictive in that certain game mechanics \"reset\" at the start of a new day (such as harvesting and long-duration builds completing).  I've not yet visited another island as the cost is still a bit too high.  The synced world time is pretty interesting as well as certain things are available based on TOD--I've never played a game like this.  To think that there are seasonal elements is quite exciting--can't wait until Halloween!\r So far, the cons are the highly irritating character voices that can't be muted; after the initial few minutes I was wishing I could just do away with it.  Cycling through the menus is rather tedius.\r Overall, quite pleased with Nintendo.",". Me encanta como en esta versi\u00f3n todo puede ser modificado en menor o mayor grado por el jugador. El grado de personalizaci\u00f3n es muy alto, lo que resulte en muchas horas de juego. Los personajes, los dialogos, los dise\u00f1os, la m\u00fasica, todo me ha parecido muy bonito. Felicidades a Nintendo por un juego que va a quedar por muchos a\u00f1os como uno de los pocos buenos recuerdos del 2020.","Incre\u00edble el entretenimiento que este te proporciona y la versatilidad de poder hacer cosas que en otras entregas no como nadar y ser t\u00fa mismo. La versatilidad de los vecinos y la emoci\u00f3n y paciencia de un largo y costoso trabajo lleno de retos","AMAZING!! Really fun and enjoyable. Would be nice to have a feature where other players could have different island but other than that, GREAT!","N\u00e3o e um jogo pra todo mundo, tem muita coisa e e repetitivo mas e um bom jogo pra quem gosta de ser casual e jogar pve","Animal Crossing New Horizons is a overall solid game but I can\u2019t really bring myself to say that I personally enjoy it. It has its place for people who can tolerate how slow the game is and its repetitive gameplay loop, but I don\u2019t think that it suits me.The general gameplay loop is slowly upgrading your island, catching creatures to submit to Blathers, visiting new smaller islands, and that\u2019s where it about ends. I never have a great motivation to make my island look nice or to do anything for its inhabitants due to them often feeling robotic or one note caricatures such as this guy is strong, this girl is moody, and that\u2019s their whole personality. It\u2019s worthy to note that your islanders personality rarely play a part in your daily gameplay, the only islanders you interact with frequently (The shoo vendors) have set in stone personalities that don\u2019t factor into anything. So all in all it makes villagers just feel like side attractions/decorations instead of a motivator to continue upgrading your island for you and its inhabitants. To make your island look great you need tons of bells, which turnips become the primary way to farm them later on, which I dislike since they feel so disconnected to actual gameplay. In terms of the other parts of the loop, catching creatures is admittedly tedious but rewarding so I don\u2019t have much to say on that note. But one thing I think everyone can agree on is the major design oversights that honestly I don\u2019t have any idea how they got past play-testing. Crafting one object at a time, a long drawn out arriving cutscene that despawns any creatures near you whenever someone arrives, and more just take a noticeable toll on my enjoyment due to bow frankly annoying they are in this type of game. This isn\u2019t to say that there\u2019s nothing good about this game, the amount of things you can collect, your customizability, multiplayer, and general aesthetic are all things to take into account. The character designs are adorable, and nothing about the game aside from those oversights really frustrates me, but it\u2019s just not my cup of tea. If you\u2019re into those games where you can collect tons of stuff, and are a fan of its slow pace and relaxed nature, I\u2019d say it\u2019s for you. My final rating is a 6/10 which in my terms is a game worth playing if it suits you well.","\ubaa8\uc5ec\ubd10\uc694 \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc758 \uc232\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.\r2020\ub144 \ucd5c\ub2e4 \uace0\ud2f0(Game of the Year)\ub294 \uace0\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc624\ube0c \uc4f0\uc2dc\ub9c8(Ghost of Tsushima)\ub098 \ubaa8\uc5ec\ubd10\uc694 \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc758 \uc232 \ub458 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uac00 \ubc1b\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.\r\uadf8 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uac8c\uc784\uacc4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc790\uadf9\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ud3ed\ub825\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc120\uc815\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\ub3c4 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud574\uc92c\ub2e4.\r\ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc7a5\uc810\uc740 \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \uc544\uae30\uc790\uae30\ud55c \ub3d9\ubb3c\ub4e4\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub098\ucc98\ub7fc \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uae30\ub3d9\ubb3c \ubcf4\ud638\uc18c \uc9c1\uc6d0\uc774\ub098 \ub3d9\ubb3c\ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uafc8\uafb8\ub294 \ub0a8\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.\r Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a very good game.\rMost of the 2020 games will be won by Tsushima's Ghost or Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\rWhat a great game. It is a game that opened a new way for the game industry. It proved that games are fun enough without being provocative, violent, or sensational.\rAbove all, the appearance of cute and cute animals is the biggest advantage of this game. It is the best game for animal lovers like me who dream of animal protection or animal shelter staff.","Animal Crossing New Horizons  is one of the best  Animal Crossing  games, the Crafting mechanics/DIY system really add a lot of depth to the game, the possibities of turning a deserted Island into a bustling comunity add a tremedous level of customization to the game, the game have some flaws like the lack of Bulk Crafting and Durabity Meter to our Tools to show how long our Tools last, but with Nintendo  saying they gonna upgrade the game for 3 years, Nintendo  not only can fixes this isseus, but also add brand new mechanics  such as a Cooking mechanics  and the return of beloved character such as Brewster and the Roost  and Kapp'n  making this Animal Crossing  games the best franchise, Nintendo  just need to listen to our plees to add QOL improvement like Bulk Crafting and Durabity Meter to our Tools to show how long our Tools last and brand New Mechanic  such as the Cooking mechanics  when added in a future  update  will add a lot of  depth  and  shake the franchise  formula.","This review is mainly for me, keep in mind i have not played the game.\r-This game appeals to more casual consumers, if you are not a casual consumer, buy stardew valley, same exact premise and game play with 1/4 the cost, or at least before buying animal crossing check out stardew valley.\r-this game probably deserves a higher score but due to personal reasons i give it a 5 as my least favorite Nintendo game, not just because of the personal reasons but like 60% are because of that.\rIf you have complaints or questions message me on twitter @Rick33663767","The best Animal Crossing game yet.

As a single-player game, the game is amazing. There are a few minor areas of improvement needed such as not being able to craft more than 1 item at a time, but those are very tiny problems. However, if you play Co-op this game probably might not be for you as Nintendo locks 1 island per device which is pretty stupid.

I passed on other games on eshop that were 10% off and 50% off for this game...OMG it's worth it!","Amazing game! Well worth the money and so much fun to play! The play style incorporates elements of all the games new and old from the series and the graphics are amazing! So many hours of gameplay to be had and so many creative ideas to explore!The slow updates are exciting because you know there\u2019s more content coming and it leaves you waiting and excited to play even more!","Recently, we purchased Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a reward for my son, who had saved up half of the cost with his allowance. He was excited to play the game, as my wife and I had played every previous version and had told him how much fun it was. We were all looking forward to playing the game and enjoying watching the island build up and grow. When the day arrived, he was the first to log in and play. My wife and I then created characters and started farming and building our homes. Then, the first major 'milestone' arrived. He started working on the quest, then went out for the day. I decided to log in to my account and help out with his quest. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't. Essentially, I was not the 'main' character, and not allowed to progress the main story line. I was disappointed, to say the least. Although I had put quite a number of hours into the game already and built up my home and character, and didn't want to lose that... I was consoled by the idea that I could always start another island and experience the main storyline that way. After all, the Switch has multiple user accounts, right? Wrong. Apparently I have to buy another game copy AND console if I want to experience the game I paid for in full. Or delete my son's island and start over, which I'm not about to do. This is an incredibly poor design choice on Nintendo\u2019s part. Not allowing separate islands? Or allowing multiple players in a *multiplayer game* to have full access to the game features? Ridiculous. This may be the last Nintendo console I allow in my household. I will certainly be scrutinizing their software with independent reviewers very closely before allowing any future purchases in our household.","its great initailly then you get bored of it and never touch it again. so worth the price tho! i  put in around 100 hours in that game so quick!","Pros: Cute villagers and designs; beautiful environment; relaxing gameplay; relaxing music. Cons: Villager dialogue is repetitive; lack of villager tasks; limited activities to do with friends.","Nintendo is a constant disappointment.  This game allows ONE ISLAND. Nintendo refuses to add multiplayer options for titles that on all other consoles support. This game isn't for anyone who has MORE THAN ONE CHILD, despite Nintendo's attempts to advertise this device as multiplayer friendly. Justifying AC as having always being one island doesn't reflect on the fact this console is over double the price of past consoles and it's not a personal device any more.","I know nintendo behaves like the apple of the gaming world. But one island per console is ridiculous. Buying multiple games for one console would plain gready, but trying to force you to buy a whole new console to have your own save is taking the \u201cP\u201d. Might be able to stomach it, if nintendo actually brought out proper family sharing","I like it so much, it's a fun game, very reminiscent of the old Animal Crossing games.But, the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn\u2019t cool, even above, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. If 2 or more people play on the same switch It become bored for the other players. Thats why i give a 2 to the game","One of my favorite animal crossing games! This is one of the best Nintendo switch games from 2020","I\u2019m very frustrated at this multiplayer couch co op settings. What a major disappointment.Why would Nintendo not add split screen or allow others to perform tasks ( pockets, phone, map etc).Sure the multiplayer online might be fun IF you have a second switch AND a second game otherwise I\u2019d skip this game altogether if looking to play at home with friends.","Great game killed by idiotic \"1 console = 1 user\" solution. I had to quit the game so my son could play...","I bought this game for my 2 daughters cannot believe how bad the experience is for Player 2. Player 2 should be able to have their own island and be able to progress their own story. I regret buying this game","I love this game and I think it offers a great experience overall. Although I have a lot of problems with the game, I always come back to it and it's one of the game's that I enjoy the most. I'm really mad at a lot of the poor design decisions the game has and how it sometimes destroys the relaxing premise the game offers the player and how easy it would be to solve them, but at the same time I'm amazed at some things the game does, as I said before it keeps making me come back and a lot of times I'm just hungry for more things to do cause I love spending hours in this game even with the many concerns I have about it.New Horizons only makes me hope for a future AC game with all the great NH has while also fixing all the bad that it has and adding even more to the formula respecting its original purpose. I CAN'T NOT recommend this game when it has given me over 450 hours of play time.","RIPOFF! $60. for a one-person game. Can't even buy and use another. No idea my wife wouldn't get her own experience crafting and controlling development. My gosh, you can have multiple users in Breath of the Wild which is magnitudes more complex. This is easily solvable and simply unforgivable.","1 Island per switch is anti-consumer design and a manipulative greedy business practice that should firmly rejected.","I love animal crossing New Horizons so many gameplay features that keeps you engaged for hours on end, the charms and the cuteness of the animals is so heart-warming. After completing the storyline there is sadly little to do but still well worth the experience. Alas 8/10 a great addition to the animal crossing series.","This is a great game for all the people who think the one island thing is dumb. It's been this way for a while.","Cute, fun, laid-back time-filler. Bad value proposition, however. Not a great deal of content for the price.Passing events/occurrences is frustrating. Missing (not being able to experience at all due to time/schedule constraints) meteor showers and more is a bother.RNG with Redd\u2019s artwork is especially bad.","One year later, I still find this game a disappointment compared to its previous games in the series. Characters are boring, the island is boring without stores or any tasks. Crafting tools is tedious. Too much emphasis on customization without backing it up with all the features that usually make this series worthwhile. It hurts to rate this a 4 but with limited updates for holidays that should have been in the game since release. It just feels like this game was never finished. Waited a year in hopes things would get better but it doesn't seem like it is.","A bit boring at some points. You either love it or hate it. Good therapeutic game nonetheless.","So I was play enjoying the game but I didn't mean to time travel and now I can't go back to my original file and I don't want to retry the game because I like my villagers and I was wondering if their should be a save file where when you can go back to a old save as in you make a save and a few months of you playing you can go back to that first save but you can't go to your future island?","This game is absolute garbage I can't believe Nintendo of all people somehow messed up animal crossing it takes too long and the controls are like playing Call Of Duty with the resident evil tank controls. Nintendo should look up to Bubsy 3D which has controls that are silky smooth and a story that makes more sense than the kingdom hearts games","I'll admit. I was gonna give it a 6, but I just couldn't find enough good in it to be a 6. 5 is where it's at. But anyways, this type of game. The waste of time, no-good, stupid, half-baked game is enough to describe the entirety of this. Firstly, the graphics are good, I'll admit. For a Nintendo game, this isn't half-bad. The designs are nice too, with some nice scenery and stuff. The music is horrible though, and does not fit this game. There are three woods to describe this game. Boring, repetitive, and tedious. The long, repetitive, dialogue is tedious, the music is bland and sounds boring, and the whole game, in general, is indeed, boring. I've give it one thing though. It's visually stunning. You can walk and run with no lag, and browse around. The items also look pretty good, and the bugs and fish look stunning in the museum (once you build it). Considering how I got this on sale though, I can't give it a negative rating. I got it for $30, instead of $60, but if I did get it for $60, I would give it a 3 or 4. At least the museum is visually stunning, and looks nice. At least there's not a lot of lag. The controls are basic. Whatever. I can't think of anything more to say, so I'll leave it here. Overall, it's a 5/10. Pretty mediocre and bland, but does have some stunning graphics, and the museum is kind of cool. But the music is horrible, the dialogue is long and repetitive, and the game is boring.","Nintendo had to be SO **** STUPID. There is only ONE island, PER. ****. SYSTEM. I never got to **** play because I had to **** build on MY SISTERS ISLAND. I liked Nintendo, but they had to just squeeze more money out of the players to buy more switches to use more MORE THAN ONE **** ISLAND.","Very upset that Nintendo took a page out of EA\u2019s book. Very disappointed that only the first user per switch to open the game has full control of the SINGLE island on the switch. Such a money grab. Just allow everyone to have their own separate game and island.","One island per console is unacceptable. If you share your Switch with anyone else, don't buy this.","EDIT: modifying my score from a 4 to a 0 due to more issues with only the primary player being able to do things around the island. I do not recommend this gameI don't want to review bomb a game, but I do want to voice my opinion. This game is fantastic and I even enjoy the one island with multiple people (it should be an option but that's how I intended to play it anyway) but the fact the first person has the entire control of the island is egregious. I bought it and let my roommate play it first while I finished up work and by the next day I loved the town already at which point I discover (which had not been mentioned anywhere prior to the games release) that he had all the control in perpetuity and there is nothing I can do about it. Now I'm five days in and not going to delete it but oh my god please Nintendo, let us at least switch the island representative if not let everyone spruce up the town. And while you're at it let everyone have there own island to keep that dream alive for the rest of the reviewers here.PS. I agree with the other people that mentioned it's odd none of the official reviewers really mentioned this.","This game is extremely addicting and time consuming. Especially during COVID lockdown. Very advanced and chill. Highly recommend.","I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THIS SYSTEM TO TWEET THE DEVS AND NINTENDO.\r I bought this game for my SO. She's currently stuck abroad, so I started playing first. Only to realise that when she comes back I'll have to delete my save in order for her to have the same new player experience I've had. Thus making all my time wasted. Not only that, but if we then proceeded to play together I would be severely limited as player 2.\rTo ask for $60 and an additional Switch to be allowed to have a second island is a disgusting practice and one I cannot support.\rIt is a shame because the single player experience is great. But until this is fixed, it does not deserve a higher rating than this.","I would love to give this a better score but sadly I can not do that with the current state of the game. I paid $60 for a game that only allows one person to play it. Whomever plays first, in my case my 6 year old daughter, is the only character able to progress farther into the game. Every account that plays after that has zero control over the game and is limited by the first players progress.","1 island per console is a fabricated limitation that destroys the experience.\r Even IF you wanted to buy multiple copies of the game (think OG Pokemon Games with a single save file per cart) you could have a copy of Red and a copy of Blue for each person in the family to have their own adventure.\r Which, while that model was worse than traditional game up to that time with 3 save slots per cartridge, it still allowed each person their own experience.\r Imagine if in Pokemon Sword/Shield, another user could start a game but couldn't get to the wild area because Play 1 stopped playing at the first Pokemon center.  It would be ludicrous and unacceptable.\r Alas, this was an eShop purchase and I cannot return it.\r I would have liked this a lot more if all of the 8 accounts on a console had their own island and you could zoom out to see the whole area, think like the Hawaiian islands, so each switch could have its own archipelago.","Multiplayer is horrible you have to guess when your friend is in online shared mode to join them just to add them to your ingame friend list to message them.

Realmente vale todo o hype! Vamos mergulhar e descobrir mais o que tem a oferecer!","Almost every negative review I have seen for this game addresses the \"shared island problem.\" And it is causing the user score to plummet. However, in the midst of all the controversy, people seem to forget that this problem doesn't even affect everyone, and that there is a stellar game past this one issue. I would have rated this game 9/10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom, but I'm rating it a 10/10 to counterbalance all the reviews that forget to actually review the game and its merit rather than a single one of its flaws. I do not believe that a game so fun, heart-warming, charming, and immersive should receive such a low user rating solely because it doesn't specifically tailor to your needs. I can acknowledge the problem, and sure it really sucks, but it isn't representative of literally everything else about this game. In my mind, this game is a near masterpiece and I cannot wait to continue playing it. If you have multiple people that want to play on the same console, I acknowledge that your experience will be hindered due to Nintendo's admittedly greedy policies. However, Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a game, as a social experience, and as a Switch title, deserves much more than what the user score would initially lead you to believe.My final score: 9/10","The best animal crossing game so far. I love the beautiful graphics and everything","This is my first animal crossing game I\u2019ve ever played. I am seriously addicted to this game I cannot stop playing. Maybe the best Nintendo game yet","One island per Switch. Game is great otherwise, but deserving of a 0 for this one reason.","If your Switch has multiple users, only the player starting the game and creating an island gets the full experience. My rating reflects the enjoyment of players who didn\u2019t start the game.","The single-save system ruins the game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you are sharing a switch with others.\r Only the first player to the game can make the most decisions/progress - the rest of the players are left with the remains. In the old games you could buy a new cartridge or use a different memory card, but you can't do that here - the data is saved directly onto the switch and can't be moved to an SD card. The game is only worth it if you are the sole player, otherwise you should not buy this game until the horrible save system is removed.","Absolutely ridiculous how much limitations I have to deal with as a second player. If I buy a single player game for 60 bucks I expect to get the full content for every person that starts the game. Instead I can't progress the story in any way as the second player and I get way less items. The decision to limit it to one island per switch was greedy enough, but restricting the game for player 2 this much without mentioning it in any way is just terrible","Only 1 island per switch is awful. This absolutely needs to be fixed.  Otherwise I like the game but this is a fatal flaw.","Really upset that you can only have one island :( ruined the experience for my me and my girlfriend.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is an amazing game by all accounts. The graphical presentation is superb, so the gameplay. Now it is absolutely impossible to rate an Animal Crossing game based on only 2-3 days of play.\r","great game great fun, its colourful and chill i like it a lot, perfect for 31 years old guy (me)","The one island per Switch was a weird choice, but the fact that the Resident Rep is the 1st person to play, and as of yet, no way to change that is the biggest mistake Nintendo has made with AC:NH.","You better hope you\u2019re the only one playing it. Any other users, that don\u2019t play it first, have access to LIMITED resources. I started the game and now my girlfriend, who plays it more than I do, is bummed because she doesn\u2019t have access to certain things that I\u2019m only able to have access to, ONLY because I started the game first. I understand the one island per switch, but when you start taking access away to other users who want to play the game, within the same household, is unacceptable. Buying another switch for another user to gain full access to features, is unacceptable. Nintendo, get your stuff together and release a patch to fix this.","While the game itself is beautifully designed and cute looking and you get lots of motivations from what you can do. There are some design aspects and restrictions that are not worth to play the game...at least if you are more than one player.\r 1st critics: the menu design. If you want to buy, craft, build or sell things or just interact with objects and NPC, you have to click through the same procedures over and over and over and over again. You can\u00b4t just simply shortcut actions when done once. You can\u00b4t just hand over animals to the museum in a pack. You can\u00b4t just skip menus. No, you need to do this one after another and always go through the same question and answer procedures every time again and again. That is nonsense and game design from 1990.\r 2nd critics: Nintendo linked one island to the hardware and that\u00b4s it, no matter how much accounts are on the Switch. At all, Nintendo should have given the option if you want to live together on one island or everybody have its own. But being forced to live on one island is just stupid. Nintendo agued that it\u00b4s for protect against cheating. But why the **** do you do this? There\u00b4s no competition in the game. When people want to cheat, let them cheat if it\u00b4s part of their game experience. Are you the mother of all gamers?\r 3nd critics: it\u00b4s the worst of all and a reason to sell the game. Nintendo decided to give the full game experience just to the player who initiated the game first. HOW STUPID IS THAT. Everybody else on the Switch is not just being forced to live on the same island. NO. They can\u00b4t even do all the things that the starter account can do. Every other account on the Switch is downgraded to a worthless peasant of the leading player. Being restricted to do basic things, but not being allowed to change major stuff on the island like create buildings, modulate the terrain or doing any important action to develop the island further. Just the leading player can do that.\r Nintendo, that\u00b4s the most stupid game design I\u00b4ve ever experienced in my whole gaming career of 25 years. You are forcing families with just one console to devide into one major player and everybody else being peasant players. For a NON-COMPETETIVE game that was designed to player FREE and LIKE THE PLAYER WANTS IT TO EXPERIENCE on a FAMILY CONSOLE, you ****ing idiots.\r No Nintendo, you designed the game to experience it the way you want and sell more consoles. That\u00b4s it.","Simple enough 10/10 if you live alone. 0/10 if you live with LITERALLY anyone else in your household. 1 island per console where whoever makes the account first is the only one able to progress, and everyone else is locked into their progression with no hope of escape except a 300 paywall of buying an entirely new console. Shameful that this even took place. Easily a 0/10 until fixed.","Wonderful game to just sit down and relax with. Beautiful visuals and a great aoundtrack.","Fantastic game. Don\u2019t let the one island per switch thing ruin the entire experience.  There\u2019s more to the game. Collecting, fixing the house, Fishing, paying bills, finding new things, seeing other islands, terraforming and more.","Why one island per switch? That\u2019s so stupid and that doesn\u2019t work for families who share a switch. That\u2019s awful","El juego en s\u00ed es fant\u00e1stico, como todos los animal crossing. Este viene cargado de novedades, como el crafteo de muebles y herramientas, y la personalizaci\u00f3n. El problema de este viene con el multijugador y la imposibilidad de tener m\u00e1s de una isla por consola. No es justo que si somos dos usuarios que la usamos, solo tengamos una isla, y uno sea el que hace todo y decide, y el otro solo pueda hacer el resto de cosas.Tambi\u00e9n estar\u00eda bien poder tener dos islas aun siendo un jugador, para poder experimentar m\u00e1s con la construcci\u00f3n del terreno que te permite, o probar los distintos tipos de islas. No entiendo porque Nintendo puede haber hecho algo as\u00ed, que solo limita la experiencia final. La \u00fanica explicaci\u00f3n es para vender m\u00e1s consolas y juegos..","Good but bad Nintendo only allowing one island per console we can\u2019t transfer our saves or download our saves I hope Nintendo will add save recovery soon","It's funny, in my household, we have two switches and two copies of the game. With that said, the multiplayer still sucks. I understand trading can be game breaking, but there's literally no point in visiting your friends islands other then to just what they have. I wish there was more local multiplayer co op features as it's just really limiting to the player. \"Nintendo is known to make great games with one critical flaw all the time, usually the multiplayer\"","Lol 1 island per switch and my wife played first. So I'm **** out of luck huh?Wont buy the next nintendo console, easy decision for me.","As a long time animal crossing fan, going all the way back to the Gamecube game, I've been having a lot of fun with this game. There are a lot of quality of life changes and the customization is amazing, the best it's ever been.\r But my opinion with this game would be drastically different if I had someone to share the game with, and I can't overlook this fault even if I don't have to deal with it. Forcing each player to be a part of the first players town and then giving said players less abilities than the first is nothing but downright atrocious. This is made even worse when the very first entry didn't have this issue, allowing players to make towns based on the memory card used. Why was this drastic change made to the latest CONSOLE animal crossing when there was no issue to begin with? Is nintendo really that afraid that some people might try to cheat their completely cooperative $80 game? Who cares. Fix this issue, and I'd easily give this game an 8 or 9","This game is a must a perfect 10/10 and one of Nintendo's best system seller franchise\r You must buy and play this game well worth the 60 dollars","All what was good in Animal Crossing is right now even more thrilling and fantastic. a 10/10 easy","Never played an Animal Crossing game before this one, and I wish I Had. Being as I am the only one in my house to use the Switch I can say this game is fantastic. So much to do, everything completely customizable and a huge island to work with. For me it is very hard to put this game down. I can see the bad reviews by many people as the one Island per switch is very dumb, but being as its only me I am rating the game for what it is and that is a Masterpiece.","Amazing game, perfectly crafted for an extremely enjoyable and relaxing single player experience. It's been 7 years since a mainline Animal Crossing, and this perfectly revives the series from its grave of spin offs. If people are complaining about a single island per console, or a stripped down version of other family members villagers, the game has normally had a lesser experience for new villagers, because they did not FOUND THE ISLAND. About the single island, it was announced long before and is disappointing, but doesn't break and ruin the game.\r The graphics are lovely, and every little detail is crafted for a long running fan of the series, like a love letter to us. By far the best Animal Crossing of all time.","Cash grab tactics to get more console sales. The first player to play the game actually gets the full experience, but anyone else on that console gets a gimped version of the game with less content. Garbage.","Having multiple players on one account isn't working as expected. My achievements are gated behind the progress of my 4 year-old. Very sad.","I love Animal Crossing, but I cannot give this game anything higher than 0 because of just how ridiculously and blaringly obvious some flaws are.-One island per console. Families or couples are locked behind whatever the first player profile has done. You cannot progress if the other islander has played less than you. This is absolutely intentional by Nintendo as to entice you to have one Switch per person. Greed.-Online multiplayer is a joke. Even when you have people added as best friends, you cannot place any furniture. It gets incredibly boring very quickly when all you can do is fish and catch bugs with friends. At least on New Leaf you could go to Tortimer's Island, to meet new people or with friends, you could play minigames and grind expensive bugs and fish.-No dream towns, which was a fantastic way to check out themed towns. On that note, now it's much harder to theme your town as shops etc are not in a separate instance i.e high street.-Duplication glitch has absolutely demolished the trading community. Anyone that isn't cheating cannot buy anything for a reasonable price anymore. How there hasn't been a small patch for nearly a week now is crazy.It honestly just feels like a big step backwards for the franchise. Some pros so it's not all negative below:-Graphics are beautiful-You can move trees, bamboo and buildings-TerraformingI'll change the score if they ever fix these problems.","One island per console? Really? Nintendo you should be above this, you really don't understand multiplayer do ya, first Mario Maker 2 and now this","Game is amazing. Ruined it with the one island system. Will have to buy another switch now just like Nintendo wants.","Being allowed one island per user would be okay not per console. Have refunded this game and suggest you do the same what a money grab","Lackluster, it only allows for one Island per console. Progress is all right and the aesthetics are nice","I have been extremely excited to try this game. But I am someone who honestly has control issues when it comes to how I want to organize my island. My fiance is also very excited to play, and I let her play first. We played a little bit together, though it was immediately apparent that the first player was important and my character doesn't have a story or any sort of contribution other than existing to pick stuff up for the main person or organize my tent.So, oh well, I figured. We could turn it off and I could play alone and start setting some stuff up...oh...except I can't. Oh..and the museum isn't here...oh...and my fiance has to work from home right now because of COVID and has no time to play so I am stuck on an island with absolutely nothing to do.Thanks for the waste of 80 bucks Nintendo. The scam, trying to force people to buy more switches is disgusting","As a huge fan of the game it makes me sad that Nintendo is doing everything in their power to largely prevent what had built their industry from the beginning. It's an obvious problem that is not hard to fix and I really hope they find a way to make it co-op friendly.","A wonderful opportunity ruined by progression locked without any form of warning. If you\u2019re the main player but let your spouse or family member play first then it ruins the experience for all secondary players including yourself.I\u2019m having to delete my save that I\u2019ve put an enormous amount of time into after 5 days in-game just because of this oversight. No way to switch the island representative or delete the main player without remaking the entire island. It is heartbreaking.","This is only a full game for the first person to boot it up on the system. It is not made clear to anyone either before purchase or during the beginning of the game that players who are sharing the island with the Island Representative (player 1) will have a very limited experience. Secondary players are progress limited to the IR, and do not get the same DIY recipes provided for them that the IR gets for free. I can't fathom why Nintendo would do this other than to encourage people to buy extra switches. To be extra clear, this is not a full game if you have multiple users. If you are sharing a Nintendo and are sold on the sharing an island feature advertised, you are being misled.\r If I could return the digital copy I would, it is very upsetting to have been sold something so cynically designed. I share the game with my SO, and the limited experience has ruined it for her, which in turn has ruined the game for me. Both of us were excited since the game was announced and now, 4 days after launch, neither of us wants to touch it.","Multiplayer is a joke!!!!!!! When your family members can\u2019t play the game on their own profile.","Can't believe the game only allows 1 island per console. Absolutely terrible.","The inability to control what I can do with a game is the product of a bygone era. Locking island generation to the console and not the cartridge is absolute garbage. Then not restricting what the secondary players can do to improve the island and move the gameplay forward is just pure capitalist bull, which should be ironic seeing as this is a game whose very plot is outlined by a capitalist Raccoon. 1/10 would not buy again.","I was really looking forward to playing and creating my own island on the switch. My girlfriend loves Animal Crossing more than I do so I let her make an island and play the game first. Come to find out that I can't even play now because there's only 1 island. It's just very upsetting. Please fix the console situation","**** that **** with the \"only one island per switch\"I literally just bought the game before I found out and now I'm stuck with it.The game's apparently good, but **** that anticonsumer bull****. Why did you change  it instead of keeping what you had before? It was so cool when my brother and I figured out that each switch profile had a different save in BotW. That was one of the major appeals of staying on the switch. Please don't set this prescedent.Still mainly a PC gamer, bit I really like the switch. Please don't ruin it.And whatever bull**** article I clicked to get here, **** off. This is definitely worth a review bomb, especially because it's the only thing is consumers can do to be heard.","The couch coop is awful. Absolutely awful. The inability to access your pocket, having to scroll through aaallllll your tools. No option for split screen and being forced to follow player 1. Not being able to talk to villagers or participate in any activities. It\u2019s just straight up bad. I find playing as player 2 to be worse than just watching someone play.My other issue (and this one is huge, in my opinion) is the limitations placed on each console. The fact that it is not only 1 island per console, but that\u2019s it\u2019s only one primary player per console is ridiculous. I\u2019ve heard people argue that this is the same as what they did with new leaf... it\u2019s not. The switch is a $400 FAMILY console. It has numerous games marketed to families and groups. It is NOT reasonable to expect people to spend $300-400 on a second (and third, or fourth) console PLUS the additional costs of $90 per game just so everyone in a household can have the same experience.Nintendo screwed up. The single player content is amazing, but the absolute fail when more than one person in a household wants to play all but ruins the entire game for me.","Both me and my little sister were excited for this game and I payed 80$ to find out there\u2019s only one island per console. This Is infuriatingly stupid that a console with the ability to have multiple accounts and games where separate accounts have their own personal saves can\u2019t have separate games when switching accounts. Playing on someone\u2019s else\u2019s island takes all the fun out of the game so now I don\u2019t want to play a game that I spent 80$ on. Not everybody has enough money to buy multiple switch\u2019s; one purchase per household should be enough forcing families to buy multiple consoles is extremely greedy it seems those corporate dickheads at Nintendo are showing their true Colours","My roommate bought this game for us to play on my switch. I let her play first on the primary account and I just spent the past few hours playing on a second account. I can\u2019t progress the island at all leaving me hardly anything to do after just starting the game. I\u2019ve lost all interest in playing the game already.","Everything about the game is awesome, except that you know get one island. If you share a switch only one player get to truly experience gameplay. The other person just runs around with minimal objective and less opportunities. If you are a solo player you will very much enjoy the game, otherwise- don\u2019t spend the money.","As someone who bought this game expecting to share it with the family, I am disappointed that everyone besides the first player gets to make the essential decisions for the island. There was not even a warning about this. Clearly this is a greedy ploy from Nintendo to get more people to buy their own consoles.","I can't stop playing the game which is the most unfortunate part about it. I purchased the game and immediately fell in love, so much so that I spent the absurd amount of money on the New Horizons switch only to find out that I can't transfer my game data to my new console. Now I am left with a brand new switch collecting dust in the closet until Nintendo decides to get it together and allow save data transfers.","It was an enjoyable game for about 3 minutes until I realized that you have no option to make your own island, instead you have to settle for being just another villager on the island of whoever booted up the game first.If you aren\u2019t the \u201cisland representative\u201d, you have absolutely no control over your own experience. You can\u2019t even name the island you\u2019re on or unlock items at your own pace. You aren't playing the game, you\u2019re letting someone else\u2019s experience dictate what you are able to do.You can\u2019t even buy another copy of the game if you want your own island. No, that\u2019d be too easy. Instead, Nintendo decided that each console is only allowed to have ONE island each. Want your own island? Be ready to pay $360 for another switch and a separate game cartridge. Absolutely ridiculous and nothing but a blatant cash grab.","I have 5 nintendo consoles and have played at least 30 years with them. This is, without a doubt, the game that has most disappointed and boring me. Only the first player to connect to the game receives missions to advance, with the following players having to wait until the main player unlocks new buildings, characters and tools. All achievements and rewards go to the first player too, how fun !! The interaction with the animal npc is more limited and, in general, it seems to me (despite the supposed new improvements) more boring than previous versions","One island per Switch? My daugter can't play the game as it is mean. She wan't her own island. I thought the Switch was a family console? Not in this case. It is a big mistake from Nintendo please patch it so we can both enjoy this game!","Bought this game only to play together with my SO but the restriction of only one main player is a bummer...","It's a good game honestly. Lots of things to do and I really enjoy it. It's probably one of the more chill games I can play.","Great game, they improved about all the aspects of classic animal crossing, graphics are amazing and quirky, it's incredibly relaxing to play. Must buy!","It\u2019s amazing, great, good, fantastic, incredible, awesome, brilliant, splendid!","One of the best Animal Crossing games so far. I understand people who are disappointed because they can't play with their friends of wives as they imagined in their head, but it doesn't mean the game is not good. People who review bomb this game are the reason why user scores should be ignored when checking game reviews: they are irrelevant to many people and unfair at best.","the critics on animal crossing new horizons are I find that people are just not happy because there is only one island for me it is not a problem I but 9 because it just a little bug on my part but otherwise the game is awesome!","Incredible to see that you can't have more than one island. I bought this for my wife, my daughter and me. My wife began to play first, as you know, my daughter and me are unable to create our own island. Incredible to see this, Nintendo advertised their switch as a family friendly console. Seeing as this move goes in the COMPLETE opposite direction, it is just unforgivable. I would understand this for a specific solo game, but we're taking about animal crossing... Since my daughter really wanted to play the game throughfully, my wife had to just forget about the game and leave it to her. She played nearly every animal crossing games until now.","So the game is cute and fun, but I made the mistake of letting my 9 year old start the game and create an island. She\u2019s been playing now since launch and I\u2019ve decided to start a new island of my own. SORRY but apparently you can\u2019t do that unless you own another switch! One island per game! Totally stupid and unnecessary of Nintendo to do this!","Same as the rest i assume. Being 2nd player is terrible. You get no story progression or advancements. 1st player gets all of the story recipes and rewards, while 2nd player just plays the basic casual backend.Its obviously a shameless money grab by Nintendo, who, already is known for their overpriced ridiculousness. Theyre attempting to get people to buy more switches on impulse and desire to experience the full package. The upsell.I wont be buying a second game or a second switch just for that. This is 2020, multiple console saves ARE a thing.Ex: Day 3 get to placing out the new home plots, Nook gives player 1 the plots to decide where they go. Not only that, it then gives player 1 ALL of the recipes required to build the materials for the 3 homes. Player 2 gets no recipes for anything or the option to even purchase them.TLDR: If youre player 2-8 for that island, you getting shafted.BTW, as follow-up, its obvious the reviews are mixed. You can tell who is the solo/single console players are here vs the family/multiple console people.","My sister owns the switch and we both love Animal Crossing, but I'm not going to go buy a new switch to get the full experience of this game. Its a shame really.","I was extremely excited to play this game. Drove all over my city trying to find it. Finally got to play it, only to discover that since my kid had started the game, I was locked out of experiencing the majority of the game. I\u2019m now forced to start over, after managing to unlock several things. I\u2019m beyond frustrated with it, to say the least. Shame on you Nintendo for ruining this game.","I bought a Nintendo Switch specifically for this game and was sooo excited to get into it. But it turns out you can only have one save file and on top of that, only one character has full freedom in the progress of the island. And since me and sister split the money it took to buy the switch and the game, we were planning to both play. But, little did we know, we can\u2019t both play individually. What a waste of money for restricted gameplay.","It would be an awesome game if they fixed the multiplayer. There are two huge problems with this game that honestly breaks it for me. First: if you have more than one person on the console you all have to share the same island and all the resources. 4 people in my family have to share the same island and it feels so crowded. I wanted to be able to make my own island and customize it how I want but I cant... Second: player one gets to do all the main storyline things and you cant change it unless you reset the game....   Im player 3 and I want to to contribute but I cant. I am really disappointed which is sad because I was so excited about this game. I had new leaf on my DS and it was my favorite game. I hope this gets fixed but I doubt it will since its definitely a tactic to get people to buy entirely new consoles.","This game is extremely limited if you are not the 1st person to make a character on your switch. Whatever you do, be sure you are the first person or else you might as well not even play the game. I hope Nintendo decides to update the game to fix this issue by at least allowing players to switch who is the Resident Representative for an already existing island.","This game is amazing! One of the best this year but nintendo needs to stop with the BS and give us Cloud saves, multiple islands on 1 switch for users, and the ability to transfer data to another switch in general not just with cloud saves.","ONEISLANDSUX....   really? You have to be kidding...  to not give the option is down right trashy... so glad the game experience is trash because I had to go to work and now don't get to play the game as intended...  greed....  greedy.... trashy..... greedsters...","Bombing this review in the hopes that Nintendo release an update to change the issues with this game.\r Beautiful game, really fun and fleshed out with so much to do, for player ONE only. Greedy corporate business logic, trying to pressure people to buy a second switch. Its becoming a Nintendo trademark.","Bought my wife the game for my switch. She\u2019s 30 hours in. I wanted to start my own island from scratch but Nintendo expects me to spend $399 CAD more for a new switch and $80 CAD more for a game both of which I already own. This is beyond stupid and greedy from Nintendo. I\u2019m extremely disappointed. Rated a zero cause I don\u2019t get to play a game I already paid for on a console I already paid for.","You already know the issue... LOCAL MULTIPLAYER IS THE WORST THING. My sis started it first and now it feels like she has way more power over me and it is clearly emphasized in the game","1. One island per switch 2. Local multilayer is terrible. Players must compete for limited resources, no split screen play, 2nd player locked from game progression.3. $20 subscription for online multiplayer, which is bound per account NOT PER SWITCH4. Constant tool breakage makes the flow of play feel annoying, not relaxing. Who wants to bet Ninendo will sell a solution to a problem they made just like Pocket Camp?I won't be buying another Nintendo game or console after this con.","One island is not enough! Why would you make it to where I can only have one island when I have a full household of people wanting to play? Fix this NOW!","If you have brothers, they can't enjoy the full experience of the game because in nintendo are idi0ts and make ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE IN 2020...","Definitely not a multiplayer friendly game. If you are solo playing, then this is an amazing game. If you were looking to play along with your family on a single console, don't bother. I've waited for this game with excitement only to be hugely disappointed.","I was very excited to play this game. Animal crusting is a great series and the island concept sounded really fun. Sadly, the game progresses very quickly and they throw out the entire deserted island concept within the first day. I went from camping in a tent to having a house in about 4 hours. It feels like I'm going to have done everything there is to do within a month.And that doesn't even touch on the multiplayer nonsense. You're limited to one island per console, so player two doesn't get a full experience. Player 1 controls the island, every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control. If I hadn't started the game the same day as my girlfriend and waited a week or so to start playing, I'd be dropped in a \"deserted island\" full of houses, people, and businesses.Don't bother buying unless you plan to be the only one playing.","Fix the multiplayer!Did Nintendo even sit down and attempt to play this with other people and think it was ok to affect an entirely different profiles play through by the actions of another profile?1 island per household?Patch this...please.","This game is good if you\u2019re playing it by yourself on a single switch, but playing as part of a family on a single switch is horribly broken and crippled by Nintendo\u2019s predatory business practices. I will be returning this game, as it is unplayable for anyone but the first person to make an account in our 5 person family.","Purchased this game for the first time by recommendations for friends this could be a good shared game to play with my very young daughter. Unfortunately upon playing it it seems clear the game was not ever actually intended to support more than one person playing on the same switch and has serious design issues. Very disappointing. I had been so excited on first playing but now I'm just disappointed and will not be purchasing any further games from AC as it's clear they just want more money rather than caring about their customers.","I made an account to say this.\rI let my little sister play the game before me and am now stuck having put a good 10 hours into the game without being able to progress any farther.\rLet me change who the damn resident representative is!\rFun game other than that but this is a game-breaking error.","This game shows the worst face of Nintendo as a game company, Now it is no longer enough to have several copies of the same game if several people want to enjoy it at home (something that already went against how the industry has evolved for many years) but on top of that you have to have several consoles as well. Terribly abusive.","Only 1 island per switch... come on... if someone else in your home wants to play this game they are restricted to the island of the first account to play, so that destroy the experience to the second player.","It's been said 100 times already...but one Island per switch is straight trash. The gamecube version did better than this. How can you take such a big step back cheating the core of your fanbase- young families who grew up with this game &amp; now have partners, kids?! I don't understand this, even looking at the business side. No one is going to buy this, if they have anyone else in house that wants to play. CO-OP is garbage as well.","As a solo player? 9/10. Tremendous game, beautifully polished and fun to play. Plus relaxing during a huge outbreak.\r As a collaborative/co-op player? With multiple people/friends/family sharing a Nintendo Switch and collaborating on an island? Terribly flawed. Completely hobbled by the awful decision to only allow ONE main character (the first person to begin the island). All other people/characters on the Nintendo Switch console who join the island are blocked from core story content, from progressing the island, and from unlocking recipes. They are essentially \"guest\" characters, for temporary and throwaway use.\r This is not communicated anywhere in the game, so it's possible to go weeks or months building your island before realising that when your flatmate or sibling leaves/moves out, you will be completely blocked from progressing because they were the \"main\" villager.\r Absurd, terrible design decision.","Ignore the review bombing haters. This is the best in the series. Sad that people have nothing better to do.","Terrible game... the game is not fun one island per console, single player is boring","This game is so goddamn good. The additions flesh out stuff that has existed since the first Animal Crossing but has felt underutilized in the past. The Nook Miles incentives give it a kind of mobile game feel, but without predatory monetization in place (yet?). The progression is very natural so far and I have total faith after just a couple days of gameplay that this game will be generous, chill as hell, and enjoyable for a very long time. Anyone who can't vibe with this is a straight-up hater (or maybe you just don't like crafting in games, which is fair).","dont listen to any of the 0/10's those guys have no idea how scoring games works, I havent played the game but im just here to help the other people who wanna see if the game is good or not, the game is DEFINITELY a great game that is a must buy, it is fantastic, but you can only have one island per console, but keep in mind it was like this for new leaf as well and me and my sister were able to enjoy this game completely fine on one 3ds console, the way this game works is no different, people are only mad that the other people that wanna play would have a downgraded experience since they cant change much in the village, while I do agree that they should've fixed this since the switch unlike the 3ds, is capable of having multiple accounts, while on the 3ds there are no accounts, it is only one game and one save file and when you start playing you choose your villager, it was a missed opportunity, I wish they wouldve made it so on the switch, each account has its own village and if people want to share a village they make their own villager in that account and if they want their own village they go in another account, but its definitely something ive experienced before, but back then a 3ds was pretty much the same price as a switch lite now, so if you want them to have their own console and their own village just get them a switch lite, people probably did that with the 3ds so why not with the switch? when I played on the 3ds I was the mayor and my sister was a villager and she enjoyed the game almost as much as I did. so the people with 0/10 are outright dumb cause one flaw in a game shouldnt change it from a 10/10 to a 0/10 that just makes no sense, besides, if youre forever alone or if youre the only one in your house that wants to play the game, it would most likely be a 10/10 for you, so if you like animal crossing games or stardew valley, this is a must buy.","One of my favorite series but I\u2019m overall very disappointed with how the second player is limited to what they can do compared to the first player. Overall ruining my enjoyment, since I let my girlfriend play first.","This game sucks me and my brother wanted to play on the same island but because I am not the island founder I cant progress through the game.I cant unlock any of the shops and museums just because I am not the founder.Also you can only make one island per switch so I cant even play on my own island and get the full experience on MY game.So why would Nintendo on purpose make their game worse?For money they want me to have to buy my own switch just so I can also play the full game well guess what Nintendo?I'm not going to give you more money you just lost a customer because of your greed and anti consumer bs.Also the crafting system is annoying I cant even tell when my tool is going to break what kind of horrible design is that?They also took out the measuring system so their is even less stuff to do!Yaaaay make the game have less content!This game can pound sand if you are playing by yourself I still would not recommend it just play new leaf or townsfolk those games have much more content and don't have that annoying tool system.","Completely ruined a social game.  Got this to play with my girlfriend but Nintendo has locked it to one island per consul. This would be ok if the players could equally share an island but they can't.  Anyone playing after the initial log in is essentially a glorified villager.  They cant make major decisions, participate in village projects,  or get story related crafting plans. All progress is gated by the first player.  Essentially this is a $360 dollar game as the only way to play together is to have a separate copy and a second switch.  Clear greed and money grab by Nintendo.","My girlfriend and I were so excited about this game. She got to play it first because I had the flu when our preorder shipped. She said she was having so much fun and I was so excited to play it. When I was finally able to play it, I found out that I don\u2019t matter as a player in the game. Nothing I do matters, I can\u2019t progress the island, and there is no point in me even playing. Like, come one man, I don\u2019t have the money to buy a whole new switch just so I can enjoy a game too. It\u2019s ridiculous. Why is it so hard to make a game that 2 people can enjoy, either simultaneously or on the same console?","The fact that second profiles are limited complete break what was otherwise a good game. As someone who bought this as their first AC game, it should be reasonable to expect that different profiles will get the same experience - at the very least they should explain this at the beginning of the game and let you transfer who is representative at will. We're quarantined and I'm still working 8+ hours from home while my girlfriend is laid off due to COVID-19. Now she can't progress until I make time.","Why is it so slow? I shouldn't have to wait days to progress.\r Also please fix the issue with only 1 player being able to progress on the island.","I share the game with my wife and because I am the second player I can do nothing to advance the game.","I had my wife set up her account first as it was a surprise gift for her, not entirely sure if she would like it. Well, now I am locked out of progressing on my own and we are forced to share materials on a daily basis. I can only progress up to wherever she currently is and if she progresses when I'm not home, then I don't get to see it at all. There's no reason to have to buy another Switch and game just to be able to do my own things. The single-player experience is ruined for me since I'm basically backseat riding her account. This either needs fixed or spammed with bad reviews as this is unacceptable in modern gaming.","Great game! The characters are so charming and loveable! I miss that Brewster is out, but other than that this game is such a huge improvement against New Leaf. I love New Horizons","All around fun family game with great detail. 7.5/10, but gave it a 10 because of review bombs.","Like many of the reviewers I have run into the problem where any progress I have is gated by the first resident of the island. My wife played the game when it first came in the mail on Friday. Now over the weekend and into this week I have not been able to get the ladder to explore our island as she has not done the mandatory quests that she can only complete. I have lost any ability to progress in the game and lost complete interest in the game due to 0 progression or purpose in playing.","don\u2019t know why the user score is so low, you're crazy. this is PERFECT! this was my most anticipated game for the switch and i am completely overwhelmed","I have been Playing New Horizons for a while now and it\u2019s worth the wait. The game is relaxing, enjoyable, well thought out, and fantastic you can chill with your friends online. It\u2019s fun for all ages. Right now, we really need a distraction from the chaos around us, and this game has come at the perfect time. So relax, hop on that plane, and enjoy your new life on the beach, in the woods, or even by the river. The choice is yours. Build your own house","Anyone rate bombing this game for one bad feature needs to stop you dumb and you should feel bad","Animal Crossing New Horizons is the pinnacle of the series and the perfect answer to this chaos we face. Us old timers already expected multiplayer would be fine across consoles,this i has always been the case and the single console multiplayer is really just a bonus.  Just know that this game is a zen inducing beautiful other life you will easily get lost in.","Animal Crossing made the impossible: surpass Animal Crossing New Leaf. This is the definitive game in the series. AMAZING!\r Note: don't pay attention to the average mark, cause they are giving low averages with no sense.","God, what is this? You can only have one island per Switch. I don't understand this choice, Nintendo. It's a deal breaker for me. Fix this immediately.","I bought the game digitally but being the console shared with my girlfriend I discovered that we cannot play two saves with two different islands.  All this is unacceptable, to play in two you must have two switches when instead with all the other games you can have two accounts.  I hope they fix this otherwise it deserves 0, not having given me the opportunity to deepen the game.","esta buenardo ya que es super adictico y divertido amigo las mejores rimas en mi reviews","Best entry in the series to date! Get it now! Don't even think about it! I began playing it 4 days ago and haven't stopped. The quarantine is real where I live and all I get to do all day is play this game! Believe me when I tell you it's really good. It starts off a little slow but you'll get the hang of it in a few days. Eventually you'll have so much to do and see! A quick tip: DON'T TIME SKIP!!\r 10/10\r MASTERPIECE","Incredible game and a must buy. Those giving it low scores are being petty and nitpicky over the smallest things. By far the most wonderful game ever to come out of the animal crossing franchise!","Great game! So much care was put into making it. It offers a great experience to all types of players.","It is fun game. Lots of stuff to do. Weird that you must share a island.....but still cool. Very pretty. Very epic 10/10 would play again.","I\u2019ve been playing Animal Crossing since the first game in the series and I\u2019ve always loved it, and this one is amazing. The game does start slowly and it takes a bit of time to get all the features from other games, but I kinda like that, and if you want you can time travel to speed it upIf you\u2019ve come here looking at reviews to see if you want to buy the game I suggest ignoring the people giving it 0, they\u2019re review bombing the game and using a feature that was multiple times said to not exist. All the marketing through directs as well as press said there would only be one island per console. Now if you have kids or want to play with someone else I could see that being a deal breaker obviously, but when you see a 0 you know that the person is reviewing in bad faith. Especially when you \u201cworse than EA\u201d getting thrown in","El juego esta genial y el crafteo esta de lujo, ahora, me parece fatal que solo se pueda tener una isla por consola pero peor me parece que compartiendola solo el perfil principal pueda hacerla avanzar y el perfil secundario, como es mi caso, este limitado a ser un simple visitante sin opcion de hacer avances en la isla.","I'm a first-timer with Animal Crossing and I am pleasantly surprised. The world is so charming and the game is designed to be explored at your own pace. Don't let the \"cuteness\" fool you. Underneath the whimsical appearance lies a brilliantly designed game... that's a whole lotta fun.I can tell that time and care went into this title. It's in the details. Just because things aren't exploding on screen, doesn't mean there's less going on. The fun I am having has to do with the freedom to really design my own little Oasis. I usually shy away from design-driven games like Minecraft because I get bored very quickly... this however feels very different. There are goals to achieve and rewards to receive. The game gradually teaches you it's mechanics in a way that doesn't make me fatigued or bored- there's always something just around the corner to perk your interest.I cannot believe the negative reviews this game has received. I'm hoping these are kids that are \"review bombing.\" The reviews are so juvenile in composition and riddled with silly, subjective reasoning-- it can't be written by anyone older than 12 (no offense).","I love the game. It is very fun to play the co-op with friends. People are complaining theirs only one island per switch but that's ridiculous. That was said before the game came out and every animal crossing game works like that. Personally I wouldn't want one island per person as I like working together to make a great island.  Really the only complaints I have are in the co-op i wish things the follower picked up didn't go to the recycle bin and I wish more than one person could go to the mystery islands.","First and best animal crossing by far, don't listen to the mad multiplayer people this game is amazing!","Don\u2019t trust the people review bombing this game. It is fantastic!The negative reviews are only focused on one small portion of the game regarding its multiplayer functionality. So instead of weighting all portions equal in the review they just give it a 0/10 because they\u2019re upset. Animal Crossing has always been like this with one island/town per save. How they didn\u2019t see this coming is beyond me.","Don't listen to the user reviews. The game is downright amazing. Was never an animal crossing fan until my wife and I played this together. We are hooked!","Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I don't want this to be a shallow \"review bomb\", but it is the only way, I feel, to get Nintendo's attention and get a genuine fix pushed forward.\r An absolutely brilliant game with 1 unbelievable fatal flaw: Having multiple players on the same Switch gates features, progress, and quests from all but the 1st player to play. Not only is there only 1 island per console (a design feature that should have been abandoned in the industry back in 1996), but only the 1st player to start the save file is designated as \"Island Representative\". Only they may talk to Tom Nook every day for quests, get various crafting recipes that, as far as I can tell, are exclusive to them, only they can place the housing for new residents, start building the museum, and on and on.\r It's such an unfathomable misstep in an otherwise brilliant game. It's an easy 10/10 if they fix this, and fix it right. First and foremost, allow every player to make island progress and decisions, designating each player as the Island Representative role. Secondly, please, allow for multiple Islands per console; 1 for each player account. The *only* reasonable explanation for this decision is to pressure consumers into buying not only multiple copies of the game, but multiple Switches entirely. This is unacceptable and downright predatory. If they're concerned of people cheating and having multiple islands to farm, people already Time Travel, so who cares?\r Please, please, please. Do the right thing, fix these incredibly broken parts of your game, and let me love this game as it deserves to be loved.","This is an incredible game and the problems people are review-bombing this with won't be problems after a week of play.","I bought this game to play specifically with my wife but apparently, Nintendo wants us to ALSO buy a second Switch to be able to make that happen .  I'm done with it, just going to return it and say the game was defective.  If more then one person uses your Switch, don't waste your time and money with this game.","The fact that only one player per household gets to go on the missions and collect the prizes while every other player is locked out of missions is rediculous. It seems like a ploy from Nintendo to get households to purchase multiple switch consoles.","One island per switch should be changed. It is a terrible money hungry idea and it should be fixed in the next patch","Nintendo made the greedy decision to only allow one island per a switch even if you have two copies of animal crossing. If more than one person in the house wants to play and have their own island you must own multiple switches.","As it is right now, I have to give it a 0 since you can only have 1 island per switch and my girlfriend is the primary player. Since I can not create my own island without paying $360 for a new switch and new game, it was a waste of money for me. There's absolutely no reason why in this day and age you should only be able to enjoy a game like this on a per console basis. If they change that so I can also make a new game then I will change my score, but as it stands this seems borderline criminal, anti-consumer, and it appears to be a cash grab by Nintendo. I can only imagine the problems this causes in households with children trying to play.","Terrible, one island per switch, greed of nintendo is displayed here. They have no care for their supporters if they are willing to rob them of their money. Please don\u2019t buy until they fix this.","Only 1 islind for 1 console, are you serious? My wife started plaing AC, and i'm missing all the story. And we cant even move the save to different console. Thats pretty dumb limitations to force us for buing additional copy of the game.","I think it is ridiculous that Nintendo thought it would be acceptable to make it so you can only have one island per switch console. There are families that have shared consoles across their kids. So what, are they supposed to buy another two or three switches and games so that everyone can have their own island? Every other switch game can save on separate accounts for different people to play through, so I know that this wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t have the capability to allow people their own islands, it is 100% obvious it was a money grab opportunity for them. It\u2019s really upsetting because it is a great game so far, it\u2019s a shame that 2+ people can\u2019t play it on their own accounts with their own islands. You had to take a bigger step from making people buy separate games to play different towns in New Leaf to making people buy their own switches plus another copy of New Horizons. Even a step further, you made it so that when someone else is playing on the creators island, they can do next to nothing to make their own kind of progress. I tried to put up with that form of multiplayer but it is extremely irritating and pointless to even play it at that point. Way to take the fun out of such a promising game Nintendo.","The game has become way to frustrating and really lame having to share an island. Just like every other game out there. A different user on the switch should be able to have their own island. Plain and simple. What a waste of $65","Why are holidays locked to being downloaded only. Why are we locked to one island per system. Why is Nintendo doing everything they can to make sure consumers don\u2019t enjoy a game how they want. Selling the game how I did Luigis Mansion 3 and New Super Mario Bothers Deluxe if it\u2019s not fixed.","Multiplayer is a joke.  I bought it for my kids and only one gets the missions.  Nintendo should know better.","Not enough innovation.The same repetitive experience but with some features missing like the island from the 3ds game.","One island per console is a cheap and pointless cash grab showing Nintendo cares more about profit than fans...","I never write reviews but i needed to do this one to counter the brainless review-bombers/trolls. Anyways this is one if not the most wholesome game i've ever played. And it came in perfect timing with the whole coronavirus situation... I've played New Leaf but this one is in another level of adiction with me and my girlfriend already puting lots of hours since launch. The new crafting mechanic is a lot of fun and keeps the game fresh and the customization options of looks and house + quality of life improvements are very welcome.Definitely a must play for Switch owners.","I'd probably normally give it a 9, since I reserve 10s for games that land in my \"best ever\" list. But the review bombing here is insane.\r This is the best Animal Crossing experience to be had, ever, in my opinion. The quality of life improvements are killer, the fact that you can change the entire island up are great (putting furniture outside? Say whaaaat? Why was this not the norm long ago?)\r I have played with online friends for several hours over the last couple of days, there is very little lag, and we are all having a blast.\r This doesn't really change much about the formula of animal crossing, and if you have been playing New Leaf for 7 years straight, you may prefer just staying in your old town. But if you want a definitive, next-gen animal crossing on console, this is the best (I mean, the only, but also the best) thing for it.\r It's beautiful, adorable, and a better experience than any AC game that came before it. If you are an AC fan, go ahead and get it. if you're not an AC fan, this might change your mind.\r If you only wanted to buy this game because of a certain type of multiplayer that you wish it had, but has never had, was never planned to have, and had never been described as having, then go get another game. But it's a great experience, and you will be missing out.\r P.S. The museum is my favorite thing about the game. Whoever designed that fossil room needs to design actual museums because I am in love.","Absolutely wonderful to play. Anyone who is negative review bombing is ignoring all of the wonderful aspects of the game- and the fact that multiplayer in this game is much more inclusive and effective than AC games in the past. I mean in New Leaf, there was only one player who could be mayor (aka only one decision maker) and I didn't see nearly the same amount of outrage. The fact of the matter is the switch is a singer player device that offers multiplayer options, and they are not obligated to do anything. Additionally, people are not being patient enough to get through the introductory period in game, after you wait through the introductory period, all characters will eventually be able to add things outside and terraform. I absolutely despise how susceptible people are to outrage culture, and how impatient people are. If you aren't patient enough to play this game, then that's on you because the nature of AC is to make progress slowly. Sorry you all weren't instantly gratified.","Multiplayer is crap, utter crap, completely crap, absolutely crap, couldn't be any more crap","First, I do not share my switch with anyone so I do not experience the account problems listed in the Negative reviews.\r As an AC veteran, this game fulfilled my wishes from when I was a 5-yr old playing the gamecube version. The game gives you so many options to live your life on the island. You have just about total control over every single thing on the island.\r What a lot of people love about the AC series is that THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE. You can do literally whatever you want. You have the OPTION to fill the museum, buy every single item, buy every single piece of clothing, and even refuse to pay off your loan from Tom Nook because we all know he's greedy. That is the beauty of this series. It's not meant to be played by the traditional gamer who expects the game to end. That's why so many people have been playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf since it's release date in 2013!\r It's a relaxing game filled with so much more personality than New Leaf. Just yesterday, one of my villagers was singing by the lake for 20 minutes! You can see villagers sweeping, building - my poor Biff has yet to catch a bug and gets super sad about it.\r Overall: \"Enjoy the small things in life.\" \"Live in the moment.\" This is what Animal Crossing New Horizons means to me","Stays true to the series while adding new things to do such as collecting materials to create tools and items. Full and fresh textures with vivid colors. It\u2019s really a beautiful game, if you like the other Animal Crossing games you will find some joy in this game.","Very chill game broo, perfect to play with friend or fn... Beautiful graphics #baitulmaljaya","It's really relaxing and helps my anxiety the only downside is that progression is locked behind the first player to boot up the game but as long as that first player is invested in the game then it's really a very minor problem that's easily fixed and not the game breaking thing the other review ers say it it","11/10. I\u2019ve played this since 2008/2009. Amazing and unique game. The characters are too cute, the customization is great, and it feels good to just vibe.  It\u2019s a shame a bunch of babies had to ruin the score to get a point(?) across. Maybe if they pulled some weeds they\u2019d feel better.","Set up a metacritic account just to score this game 10/10, its ridiculous that \"fans\" are review bombing it purely because of one thing they dislike. This game is incredible, whether you're an old time animal crossing fan like myself or are new to the series. Works perfectly for the switch and I've really appreciated it even more so during this global crisis. Spending time developing your own personal island with friendly animal residents cheering you along the way. Trust me, you dont want to miss out on this game, Nintendo have promised regular updates with special events relating to current seasons etc. Non stop content for all!","The developers worked very hard on all the details in this version of the game. Haters are complaining about a pre-existing mechanic in all other versions, and it's an animal crossing premise. I just loved this game and I have no complaints. Even the high price I feel is a fair value for the product.","I preordered this for my girlfriend\u2014along with waiting in line just to get the limited edition console\u2014and was excited to share a game that I had unexpectedly fallen in love with back on the Gamecube.  Boy, have things taken a turn for the worse.  Only one island per CONSOLE?  That, combined with playing the same awful 3 minute guitar strumming on an endless loop (a bug that Nintendo has not even acknowledged, let alone fixed)...those in isolation would have dropped this from a 10 to a 5.  What drops this all the way to a 2 is the fact that I cannot do anything at ALL to advance the game when she isn't playing.  Okay, so I can add to the museum...but I couldn't get the museum to exist, and I cannot get anything else to happen.  I am beyond peeved, and Nintendo's silence in response to criticism is deafening.  I am furious about this, and would return this game IMMEDIATELY were it not a gift.  What on Earth happened to Nintendo?  I will NEVER buy another game or game system from Nintendo until they fix what they screwed up.","Me and my boyfriend got in this huge fight because we went out, bought the switch and New Horizons. Just to find out only one of us can play, TRULY PLAY. It\u2019s so frustrating, the POPULATION ARE NOT IDIOTS. We understand that this is a PLOY TO GET US TO BUY MORE NINTENDO SWITCHES. You think that this will get you more revenue? No, in fact it will hurt your game because there won\u2019t be as much users playing at the same time. Why does anyone want to share an Island together? The beauty of the game is being able to create whatever you want and express yourself. Also the fact that the game is in real run time ABSOLUTELY KILLS IT. Are you kidding me you\u2019re going to make it only one island, expecting the players to share because up to 8 of them can live on the island? And incorporate the fact that it is a deserted island so there\u2019s going to be nothing there, A LACK OF RESOURCES already? Honestly, made the decisions to change this, this is a family fun oriented game and what keeps it interesting is seeing the other peoples towns that\u2019s what created spark. Nobody wants to play on the same town, there\u2019s a lack of quests lack of everything. Your customers are even trying to get refunded their money because of this, it\u2019s absolutely disgusting.UPDATEWe tried playing the CO-OP on screen that they had an it was an ABSOLUTE FAILURE. They made one of us each be FOLLOWER AND LEADER. The FOLLOWER COULDN\u2019T ACCESS INVENTORY, OR GO TO NOOKS &amp; BUY STUFF IT WAS JUST THE TOOLS. SERIOUSLY NINTENDO! THE FOLLOWER COULDNT EVEN TALK TO THE RESIDENTS EITHER. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.","As others have stated, I made an account just to give this game a bad review. It is tranquil and cute and seemingly fun, but for a game focused on multiplayer and community (seemingly) there is a starting lack of functionality.","The fact i need a new switch so my gf and i can have seperate accounts is heart breaking. I can't afford a new switch. I would be fine if we both shared an island but had the same controls, but p2 can't do anything that makes the game worth playing. Love the game, but we need a fix please!","This a great game if you live alone. If you have anyone else in your household, it\u2019s going to suck. You can only have one island per Switch and only the first player has full access to the game. I played and exhausted all the resources and my partner logged in and was unable to do anything. I think it\u2019s greedy for a company to take this approach considering some families only have one switch and perhaps multiple children or individuals who would like to play the game. The solution shouldn\u2019t be for each member of the family to have to buy a separate Switch and Animal Crossing game. If this game were to be updated to include one island per account then I would change my rating to 5 stars. I really hope something is done about this soon.","What a joke. What an absolute joke this is Nintendo. Let other users have their own island you greedy mongrels. I won't let this end. I won't let you guys get away with this.","The game is wonderfully simple and nuanced with plenty to do and discover. It gives players a reason to put down the game at times, but you keep coming back. There is plenty to discover and do, but gives the player the opportunity to choose the goals they want to accomplish for their play style. Unfortunately I got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co-op play. There really is no true way to play this way as was advertised. The second player is essentially an NPC. The UI and controls for single console multi-player are embarrassing for such a renowned title. I would give this game a 10 if they simply hadn't even included the feature at all; it's highly misleading. For it to work so well with online and multiple console multi-player, it seems like a regrettable attempt to force console purchasing. I would love input from the studio on why they failed to deliver a coherent single-console co-op. The UI and controls while in single console multi-player come across as if it was an afterthought  It is both hard to use and cumbersome. The inventory or tool selection isn't even available for player 2. Is it really that hard to apply the same feature to all players? Seems like poor code architecture to me. Not to mention the second player can't participate in the game contents in any meaningful way. Player 2 gets a very lazy stream of \"check with player 1\" messages instead of having NPCs treat player 2 as a player rather than a tag along NPC. Overall, for my circumstances, this game has failed in the most important ways which is why I cannot recommend it for users like me.","I bought this game, bc I thought it would be relaxing and fun. It probably is for the first player but not for the second player on the island.\r My roommate started her playthrough first and I was excited to start mine too only to be extremely disappointed that I cannot make my own island and instead I have to be stuck on her island as a second player.\rThe fact that the second player cannot progress through the story like the first one makes it a sad experience - as a second player I am missing the story, some dialogue options and interactions as well as creative control over the island and so the reception of the game changes a lot for me. Also, it's not only the story, the mechanics change too - I cannot even get the axe recipe without spending the money. The first player gets it through interactions with Tom Nook. And while the cost might be similar in both cases, the experience is very different - i really dislike it.\r The restriction of one island per switch is artificial and could easily be changed to one island per profile. I've already paid whole 60$ for this game - and because of the limit of one island per console it feels like the price is too high. Especially when we compare it to other Nintendo games at a similar price point like BOTW which can be played separately on different profiles.\r Animal Crossing has a family-friendly rating and so you would think it would be a family-friendly game, but if you want to play with your spouse or have more than one child you would have to buy a whole new Switch for both people to enjoy the game on their own instead of having to share an island because of some artificial restrictions.\rAlso the fact that this cannot be remedied by buying a second game cartridge and only by buying a second Switch makes it feel like a cash grab on the side of Nintendo. I understand that the saves are stored on the console not the cartridge, but I am sure this could have been remedied in some way.\r I had very high expectations of this game and was looking forward to spending time on my island paradise with cute animal friends, but instead I feel like an NPC in my own game and I have to fight over resources with my friend...\rI wish I could give this game a higher score, bc it really is cute and sweet, but I don't feel like I can do that in this situation - thus the low score.\r I hope Nintendo rethinks this and patches the game, but I am not very hopeful that it will happen.","Local co-op (a key component of the game) is effectively broken; though I'm sure only being able to progress with a single character at a time is a \"feature\" according to Nintendo...","I recently purchased this game and got pretty farby myself. My wife Wanted to play as well and start and island together. So I started my game over let her start the island.After hours of playing I could not figure out why on my account I could not build the museum how I did previously. My wife plays but not as much as I do, had I know. i\u2019d be limited I would have set my character up first. Regardless she\u2019s annoyed that we both have to start over again after several hours of gameplay and after restarting she has no interest in the game and we\u2019re both extremely annoyed that we can\u2019t build an island together. Rather its one player building it and another person is just along for the ride.Pretty lame, after all of this starting over multiple times its getting difficult to find enjoyment in the game.","My personal experience of this game was very disappointing. I share a switch my boyfriend and he already started his island a few days before I was able to begin. I am not able to create my own island and I have to live on his. We had completely different experiences of the game right away because he\u2019s in charge of the island and gets to decide everything. I was really looking forward to making my own island but now I\u2019m not even sure if I want to play. I don\u2019t want to be forced to buying a whole new console and game just so I can have the same game play experience as someone else in my Jimenez. Bad design.","One island for the console !!!  Only one, it's just some kind of nightmare, I paid 60 \u20ac and they put some other restrictions on me, as if I downloaded the demo.  Shame on Nintendo, I hope this decision will be reviewed as soon as possible.","At first I was having some fun but a little bored that\u2019s because when I saw what the first player to log in can do I was disappointed this game is designed for families with multiple children interested in the game but have 1 switch it\u2019s main purpose is for you to buy a whole new switch so everyone can experience the game fully.","Been working hard this whole week with my fiance asking me constantly about when am I going to start my island. I finally found time to sit down and do it. Well, too bad. Apparently I can't, because of Nintendo greed. She had made her island first and neither of us realized that her making the island first would screw over my own ability to make an island. This along with the whole coronavirus quarantine lockdown and Nintendo's shortage on Switch consoles makes this whole thing an even harder pill to swallow. I guess I just won't be playing this one, Nintendo. Thanks for the betrayal Nintendo, didn't expect it to come from you, but I don't get fooled again.","This is one of the worst games i have ever played.  Not only that, but Nintendo's no refund policy should be illegal.  I will never buy another Nintendo game again.  Knew getting a Switch was a mistake.  Ridiculous.","I bought this game knowing that it was one \"shared\" island per console, which to be honest, I was ok with. I am not ok with secondary accounts treated like second class citizens. I give this a 2 because I can only experience 20% of the game. I share a console with my brother and it was taking me days to figure out how to get a shop. Turns out only the first account can progress the game. For Pete's sake I can't even build a bridge.\r I hope Nintendo fixes this, as it really damages the playing experience.","This otherwise wonderful game is hamstrung to the point of unplayability in a household by the fact that the first user controls the progress of the island. This would be fine if you could start multiple islands, but, surprise, Nintendo artificially capped each system at 1 island in a blatant attempt to sell more consoles.Allow multiple islands or fix multiplayer, having both of these critical flaws completely ruins the local multiplayer.","The game is currently broken and does not allow you to make amy progress whatsoever if you're not the first person to open the game.So if you try to open the game on your profile after someone already did, the game forces you to play on someone else's island and you can't do anything at all. Just run around catching sih, bugs and shaking trees for eternity.","This game could be fun if both my wife and I could enjoy it.  However, it's only fun for one person as the second person to make a character is locked out of submitting things to the museum, inviting and moving villagers, and other decisions.It's a gimped experience for everyone but the first player with no option to make multiple islands.","One island per console for all local profiles. Progress locked to the first local profile to start the game. No warnings of any of this. Everyone else is a second class citizen who can't play independently whatsoever. Full price disappointment. Local co op totally gimped and basic features not available to second player. Reviewers should not have missed this. Shows how little video game journalists actually do their own research nowadays.","to start, this game is terrific. for a single person playing on a switch console, its amazing. the graphics are beautiful, its creative, wholesome, cute and so much more. however.... as a couple or a family that shares a switch, this game ends up being extremely disappointing. such a bummer, and it makes me sad !!! the first player to create the island is given the role of representative. they can develop the island, place buildings, control the growth of the island, and overall have a meaningful contribution to the game. but everyone playing after the representative has been chosen, is forced to basically be an observer. they cant share in the same goals and fulfillment that the representative can. now theyre left out. you have one person the best game of the year, and the 2-4 extra players just watching the progression of the game without being able to contribute.  this could be fixed by just letting multiple people be the representatives of the island, or just letting us create our own profiles with our own islands. either way this could be much more fair. but instead, its just disappointing.","The sheer greed on Nintendos part is amazing. After paying 300 for the console + 60 for the game, you realize that you cant play with multiple islands per console. Not per save, not per game, per console. Per 300 dollar console. There is frankly no excuse on Nintendos part, except pure greed, and it is a shame, since it runs contrary to everything Animal Crossing stood for. And before you say, \"its part of their artistic vision\", I agree, it I$ a p$rt of the$r $rtist$c vision.","1 Island per switch and all progression limited to the 1st player - desperate cash grab from nintendo to encourage you to buy a 2nd switch. This is very disappointing given they marketed the game with a strong social element. Local coop element is also pointless with player 2 being unable to do most things.","The single player looks great, however as the second player to start playing on this console, this game is a waste of time and energy. Until the co-op is fixed I can't imagine ever being able to enjoy this game, as I'm essentially just an NPC.","In brief: it's impressive that Nintendo managed to create a family game that in no way caters for families.\r The issues with the primary resident versus other players is are well documented, so I won't rehash them here. What's particularly disappointing is that anyone could have foreseen this: it's a family game and, given that there's only one island per Switch console, more than one person is likely to want to play it (unless you've got a very small family).\r It would not have been difficult to allow players 2+ to contribute to things like building new houses, but instead they're just left out in the cold. In this particular case they can read the construction sign, but cannot see the requirements or provide materials without sending them to the primary player.\r It makes a certain sort of sense to only allow one person to make significant modifications to the island, but even then it would not be a particularly big ask to allow the primary player to grant the rights to players 2+.\r Similarly, resources like rocks are relatively limited and are handled on a per-island basis: that is, if one player harvests the rock (by hitting it with a shovel - you can get up to eight items per rock without destroying it) no other player can harvest that rock the same day. Because of this, sharing resources between two people is challenging \u2013 three or more must be a nightmare.\r Nook points to get tickets to semi-random islands to harvest are a partial solution, but the rate at which one can gather Nook points slows rapidly as you progress through the game to the point where this looks like it's going to cease to be viable very soon (5-6 days into the game).\r Overall I'm really, really disappointed and I generally expect a lot more from Nintendo when it comes to games that can be played by the whole family. I'm not sure what Nintendo's goal here is; perhaps that we should have a Switch AND copy of the game per member of the household? If so, that's a losing bet, for sure.","I would absolutely love this game, if I were able to play it. With nintendos ludicrous decision to limit the game to one island per switch, I can no longer play the game as I share a switch with my girlfriend. This is completely unheard of on a HOME CONSOLE, and is not acceptable for a largely single player game. Nintendo, please fix this.","If you ONLY want to play alone, and NOBODY else in your household wants to play, then it's a good game.\r God forbid anybody else want to play though, sucks to be them. They can't create their own island, and they can't really contribute in any meaningful way, instead being forced to sit in the background while you do everything worth-while and story driven.\r What the heck was Nintendo thinking? this is absurd!","Only one user per console is completely unjustifiable and it ruins the experience entirely. Fix this Nintendo.","-no cooking\r-almost no interactions with furniture (ex: you can't play the guitar or watch tv, they are just there)\r-1 island per switch\r-incredibly bad co-op\r-item durability\r Everything is there to prolong your game time and sell more Swtiches. No depth or mechanics, only shallow visuals.\r If you're not after collecting animals for your island like Pokemon, you'd be better off playing Stardew Valley. If this was not a Nintendo title critics would rate it 6/10.","I wanted to play this game, but because I share my Switch with someone else, I can't create my own save file. I can only build a house in their town and that's it. I thought that the whole point of this game was to create your own town. And that the point of having different accounts on your Switch was so that everyone could create their own save file. It just doesn't make any sense to me.","You can only have one island and you have to share it with other profiles on your switch","Sucks. When I found out I couldn't do as much as a second player I instantly turned it off. I have no reason to play the game now. It's ruined the whole experience","I\u2019m changing my review to a flat 5. I feel a complete zero was unfair. To be fair I was angry and I still think rightfully so. However, the multiplayer issues aside this game brings back memories of playing on the GC when I was a kid. I think it\u2019s by far the best installment since then. I\u2019ve spent hours playing and it\u2019s very relaxing, yet addictive. I hope they can patch the multiplayer issues though. We ended up restarting so my fianc\u00e9e could have lead since she plays more. We lost all of our progress which was frustrating, but obviously we kept playing so they must have done something right. This game is bad for player 2.Animal crossing on the GC allowed for all for players to have the same power. In this one only the first islander can progress the island?? Are you kidding me?? How hard would it have been to at least allow the other players to donate items to Nook for the store?? Or let them put items in the construction boxes?? This game isn\u2019t family friendly at all. This game turned out to be a rip off marketing scheme to get entire families to buy the game and switches just so they could progress their islands. The second player can\u2019t even get all the DIY recipes. Ridiculous...","This is the evolution of Ninendo making you buy two copies of pokemon. If this doesn't get fixed I'm ready for a class action lawsuit","I never write reviews. I absolutely love this game. It\u2019s a blast. However, the collaborative aspect of the game is incredibly flawed. I bought this game with the intention of sharing an island with my girlfriend. However, only one of us has complete control of the island. The other villager is locked out of certain aspects of the game. This makes no sense to me. Surprisingly, the original game well over a decade ago got this part of the game right: everyone had equal control. Why is this hard to do in 2020? The whole idea that there should be one leader and everyone else should be handicapped is insane.","Don't get if you plan on using the switch as it was intended, aka a portable console you can use while you travel, because surprise surprise nintendo is so overbearing that holidays will be released as updates that you need internet to install AND to play. Good job nintendo, you really got those evil time travelers that were SERIOUSLY cutting into your bank- oh wait, time traveling affects no one but the player who might otherwise not be able to play due to travel/work/school.Game feels unfinished, hundreds of items cut, many characters cut (so no point to the amiibo features to get your fave villagers unless you're lucky), swimming/gyroids/paintings/99% of special npcs cut, everywhere you look theres cut content that we get to hopefully wait for nintendo to drip feed us while a chorus of people repeat that \"HEY. This next update in a week/a month/a year MIGHT be the one that gives us a few more basic features. MAYBE you should just stop complaining since now theres SO many new things like...oh wait, the furniture placement stuff is from hhd, and crafting furniture from harvested material to place outside is from pocket camp so. nothing new except this stick i can use to cross rivers i guess.\"-2 points for unfinished game at launch, -2 cut content over all, &amp; -3 for nintendos controlling attitude &amp; fans acting like just because they personally didn't LOVE a feature/got lucky the things they liked are in game means the cuts dont matter. 3 remaining are for graphics, which are a vast improvement from other installments.","Multiplayer is badly broken. I bought this game to play with my two kids, but unless we're signed in with the first player's profile the story won't progress. The game doesn't make this clear to you at all so you end up spinning your wheels for hours until you Google the issue. This feels like a greedy move by Nintendo to restrict sharing so badly that another switch and copy of the game are necessary.","One switch - one island = 0 copies bought. I'm not buying another console just to play with my girlfriend so we both have the full game experience. It's anti-consumer practice.","I was so anxiously waiting for this game!!!\r I have been waiting for two generations to be able to play Animal Crossing, because I wasn\u2019t interested on playing on my daughters island previously, and I thought that finally I could get my own island as Switch OS has own profiles for each player for each game.\r But what is this!? I should buy two more Switches and three copies of the game so that my daughters can get their own islands and I could get my own?\r What if my Wife wants to play? I need to buy a fourth Switch!?!\r This Switch deal is getting worse and worse.\r(We Also have 4 pairs of drifting Joy Cons)\rFffffuuuuuuuu\r I\u2019m losing my religion. And I have been such a Nintendo fanboy!!1!1!","Limiting the number of accounts/island on a family game is appalling, if you want multiple people in your house to play you are required to have multiple switch\u2019s even though Nintendo allow you to have multiple profiles on one switch this game and progress is locked to one profile.","Game would be a 9/10 if it wasn\u2019t for the single switch issue. New Leaf was still a better game and experience overall.","My wife loved Animal Crossing back in the day, so I bought this for her. Our son wanted to play too, and we saw there was multiplayer so we figured this would be fun to play as a family.This is quite possibly the worst multiplayer videogame in existence. What's that, son? You want to play by yourself? Don't have too much fun now, because you will ruin the game for everyone else, leaving them with nothing to do and an empty shell of an experience. Oh yeah, also you don't get to play any further in the game until your mom logs in to advance the game, has one brief moment of enjoyment, and then you proceed to ruin the game all over again. It's not his fault that he wants to play a game to have fun. It's Nintendo's.The lack of multiple save files and a separate multiplayer mode is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen, and I believe they didn't even playtest it. Either that or they honestly, amd stupidly, thought most people had two Switch systems or would buy another. I'll change my review if this ever gets patched, but until then, this game is one of the least enjoyable of all time. No hyperbole.","One Island per switch!!!! Glad I read the reviews before purchasing this. Game is fun to play, but no one should support this kind of greed. If the game ever updates to remove this limitation, ill buy it.","Graphics like this in 2020? Not acceptable.Plus all the anti consumer stuff is just the icing on the cake, trash.","Ended up returning the game purely based off the fact that it locks all other users on the Switch out of progressing the game. We will repurchase it when this is changed but it is complete brainless game design. Also siting other games in the series as being the same is flawed because the original AC game on GameCube you could have separate towns per memory card.","One island per Switch rather than one per game purchase.\r Unacceptable really.","The game is great. Kind of repetitive but you can overcome it anyway. I really liked the game BUT, my girlfriend liked it even more and there's the problem. I usually share my account with a sibling so my girlfriend, after seeing and playing the game with my account, decided to step up and buy the game for herself, even when I already had it just to play it with her profile. Indeed, to share the island was great to her since we could be neighbors and she got familiarized with the island. But... there's just too much difference between the treatment I receive from the game and the one she gets. She just doesn't have any event for herself, they're all directed to me. So... Even if you share, you actually share nothing and that's unpresentable, specially when we actually got two copies of the same game. So... While my original score was an 8/10, I just can't forfeit the awful sharing system","I've played it for 2 days now and I already love the game. This game truly is amazing.","I bought this game to play with my daughter who is new to video games. She played first and then I was expecting to join with my own character and help her out. Not possible because the game only lets the person who plays first progress through the game. I can\u2019t do anything useful to help her and I\u2019m basically playing pared down \u201cdemo\u201d of the game rather than having my own experiences progressing in the game. This should not have been sold as a \u201cmultiplayer\u201d game because it\u2019s only one person who plays all other accounts basically sit around and wait for the other player\u2019s progression if they progress at all. I\u2019m not going to delete my daughter\u2019s island and start over. Really hoping an update balances the players\u2019 abilities in the game. Very disappointed.","- No game data backup feature.\r- Multiplayer is terrible.\r- **** game system.\r- An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.","One game per console **** Nintendo im not buying a second Switch just so I can have another save","The game is really great, enjoy it since release day, but one island is just unacceptable!","A perfect and worthy game! A must try! Anyone who rate lower than 8 must be a jerk! Enough said!","Couldn't have made a better sequel and decisions! There so much more to do compared to past entries! The multiplayer aspect is really good despite being dependent on the primary player for a lot of things. Looking forward to the seasonal events!","In relevance to all these 0s:\rYou could ALWAYS only have 1 town. This has been a thing in every multiplayer installment of Animal Crossing. Every single one. The point is to have multiple people COOPERATE on one island rather than compete. In any case, that is ONE facet of this game. That is one little thing. A majority of the gameplay is solo. If you went into this expecting something different, that's not at the fault of the game at all.\r The fact that many cite the multiplayer as what makes this game a 0 out of 10 speaks LEVELS to how amazing it is. Imagine for example if someone hated how boring a game like Mario Maker is if you didn't have internet. That's what these complaints amount to.\r Almost every system has been streamlined and made easier or expanded upon with the exception of one: Tools. Furniture can be obtained in many ways, now randomly dropping from balloons (rather than just specific items), being able to be crafted, being able to be bought with both bells and nook miles, given away by villagers, found in trees, gifted by special characters, and of course from friends. On top of this, an improved customization system allows for you to change the appearance of many items on the fly, and for those that allow custom designs, that system has been expanded in all senses of the word: pixel art is now smoothed out, making it less immersion breaking. You can store a myriad of designs rather than 16. You have absolute control over the palette you color with instead of presets.\r Placing furniture is also a lot easier. Taking ideas from Pocket Camp and Happy Home Designer, furniture can be manipulated on a much smaller set of tiles than in previous games. A \"1 tile wide\" object can be placed on half tiles, for example. An overhead view can be utilized in homemaking to manipulate many objects at a time. Wall items can be placed anywhere on the wall, even vertically above each other. Light objects are now dynamic, allowing you to really set the mood of your home beyond just their color.\r Furniture can of course, now be placed outside, meaning you have control over your entire town instead of simply your house and a small handful of monuments. This opens up the floodgates for a truly custom experience, and in a few weeks time, I am excited to visit the towns of strangers to see the creations they built.\r Villagers have a lot more personality now. Each one will interact with the world around them and have their own tastes in furniture and clothing. While before, their personality amounted simply to what bit of dialog they spat out when greeting you at best (Sporty villager always talks about sports), this has been expanded into them actually having a preference for what furniture they want on the island, what things they want you to craft, what they give you. I had a villager give me a hat once and I wore it. In previous games, that would be the end of that exchange, but in New Horizons, later talking to the villager, he had thanked me for actually wearing his gift from days prior. They acknowledge what objects are made for now, you'll have them say \"I exercise with this kettle bell!\" or \"This wooden double bed is so comfortable to sleep in!\" rather than \"This is my favorite [insert furniture name here]\" over and over. You will find NPCs sleeping under trees, or reading a book with their glasses on, or dusting their home. It feels more alive.\r Now, for the flaws. Kind of. New Horizons puts you in the role of a resident who just moved onto a deserted island, and you have to build up from there. Now, this is a very interesting experience starting out, and I actually love the idea of it. You gather materials to build your tools to build better things and unlock more decor or better tools, a la many survival games. The issue with it however is the late game. When you get to the end of Minecraft, Terraria, Ark, what have you, you have the best tools that almost never break. There are no equivalents thus far, the best tools are twice as good as the base tools, which isn't fantastic.\r The next issue is 1 island, which while minor, is still an issue as with all the creative opportunity, you have but one canvas to work on. If you want two distinctly themed islands, you have to remove the first to do that, and it's a little heartbreaking.\r Other than those two things however, the game improves on everything Animal Crossing, and I would recommend it to all Switch owners, and say it's a NECESSITY for any Animal Crossing player.","Boring and a unique Islande to create. Quase nada por fazer na ilha. Enfim... Arrependido","Great animal crossing game. Unless you don\u2018t wanna play with someone else and multiple accounts, you\u2018re going to have some serious fun for a lot of time.","The game sucked. No interesting gameplay nor style, the game doesn't offer much at like with new leaf. You're better off just playing the original.","The game is deep, charming and endless. Customization and quality of life improvements make New Horizons the best AC to date. And please stop giving the game zeroes for not having features that weren't advertised. Nintendo made it clear that it was one island per Switch. I don't agree with it, but at least give the game a seven or eight and give a substantive review.","It\u2019s great! Nothing else to say more to describe the game. You always have something to do. You always can relax at the beach listening to the game\u2018s beautiful OST. Great, it indeed is a must play!","Gameplay itself is great if you are only user of Switch, but if you have to share the console, expiriences may vary. Forcing players to live on one island is questionable decision. This should be players choice.","Eate videojuego es excelente en todos los sentidos. Pero claro no es perfecto, ning\u00fan videojuego es perfecto. En mi opini\u00f3n tiene un solo inconveniente, el no tener la posibilidad de hacer dos islas por consola pero esto no es motivo para ponerle un 4 o un 0 de nota como est\u00e1n haciendo muchos usuarios de metacritic utilizando las review bomba para desprestigiar un videojuego o compa\u00f1\u00eda. El videojuego es excelente y se lo recomiendo a todos los usuarios de metacritic. A los que est\u00e9is leyendo esto y no est\u00e9is seguros si comprarlo o no yo os pido que le deis una oportunidad. A metacritic le pido que elimine las review bomba que est\u00e1n desprestigiando al t\u00edtulo y afectando a la compa\u00f1\u00eda que lo a creado y a los propios usuarios de metacritic.

I have been so excited for this game for so long, which couldn\u2019t have come at a better time btw. The game is visually amazing and there is so much more flexibility, more challenges and more to do. Placing items inside and outside, the crafting and customisation mechanic, choosing where villagers live, terraforming and waterscaping which are available later on are all unimaginably amazing features and really let you customise your island. Being able to play with 7 other friends is amazing, I have made huge use of this feature, having a large amount of friends who also play the game and this has enabled me to feel less isolated as well. I don\u2019t understand why people complain about only being able to have one island, me and my mum have always had 2 characters on the same town and absolutely love it. We can customise ourselves and homes individually as well as sharing many experiences, such as working together to complete the museum donations etc and doing things for each other when the other is absent. The amazing thing now is that 2 people can play on one system at the same time, which is something we could never do before and I have absolutely loved doing this! People who say for 2 people in the same house to play together you need 2 switches, that\u2019s simply not true at all. In the past this was true as you could only play one at a time and would need 2 3ds and local play, but now this is not needed as you can much more easily enjoy playing together as well as apart. People who leave 0/10 reviews obviously have no clue what they are talking about and can\u2019t appreciate how great this game is and how many amazing editions have been made -crafting, customisation in seconds, placing everything where you want, changing your whole island layout, being able to pick up entire trees and move them, being able to expand your inventory, new hairstyles and facial features that you can change when you want much more flexible pro designs- can now make hoodies and different types of dresses etc and more!! The villagers are so much more lifelike as well. This gave is everything I wanted it to be and has really helped our family and my friends get though this difficult time and connect.","Terrible experience if you have more than one player on your console the game is unplayable.","Any reviews stating that there's only one island per console are true and valid, and I completely understand why anyone with friends would be disappointed by this game. But the people who keep saying 'its slow and confusing to progress' or 'I shouldn't have to wait days to get something' have no idea what they're talking about. This isn't CoD my dudes. You bought a sim game. Would you write the same review for Minecraft? You're not supposed to rush the story and finish the game. This isn't a speedrun, it's a form of escapism and just because the end goal isn't to send Tom nook hurtling into the depths of hell to save the earth doesn't give you the right to give it a bad review like it's a poorly made game. If you're gonna do that, there are plenty of valid reasons to complain about this game. Other than the weird one island thing, it's very fun and I thoroughly enjoy it.","Un juego fant\u00e1stico, con muchas opciones, con el cual puedes relajarte y jugarlos con tu familia","1. This game is absolutely phenomenal. A perfect follow-up to New Leaf. I can't stop fishing and catching bugs and exploring the other deserted islands. I can't wait to be able to use amiibos and move Stitches into my island!!!\r 2. Animal Crossing has always been one town per memory card/console. It's been like this from the first iteration of the dang game on GameCub. You had to buy a second memory card to have a second town.\r 3. There was SO MUCH MEDIA surrounding this game that warned y'all you couldn't have a second island. It was quite literally everywhere.  It shouldn't have been a surprise to you, and if it was, maybe you should research games before you buy them?","So this game is better than any Animal Crossing game before it, it adds a ton of new features and adds to the flavor of the world of Animal Crossing, helping you become more invested in your game over all.\r However there have been a number of complains about the \"one island per console\". This has always been the case for Animal Crossing, that anyone playing on the same console and/or cart would share the world with their other family members. GameCube is the exception because it had memory cards. Just like before, if everyone wants their own isolated experience, then you need to have your own system. That's what the Switch Lite is for, it's meant to be the 3DS/DS/GBA to the Wii U/Wii/GC of its generation, except we get to play all the same games now. So like before, get your own system and copy of the game, business as usual. You probably were a single console multiple handheld family before, so be a multiple Switch family.","100% worth the wait!

Period. I\u2019ve seen many people say that the lack of the ability to have multiple islands has completely ruined their experience, but to me, that doesn\u2019t even compare to all the things done right in this game. Refinement of new features, amazing new features, it\u2019s all there. Even if this game isn\u2019t the best Switch game quality-wise, it certainly feels like the most polished of the bunch. Definitely worth the buy!","It's a fun game, arguably 10/10 if you are going to be the only one playing it in your household. If you plan on having more than one person play on the same console, don't even bother buying it. It's a shame they let greed get the better of them by trying to force you to purchase multiple consoles considering how great this game would be without this problem.

It\u2018s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more Switch consoles. This means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent. Player 2 can barely do anything, and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further. Player 2 can\u2019t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game.","One island per console is ridiculous. Selling my cartridge. Nintendo, you guys are so backwards.","So looking forward to play this game with my wife but with the limited local multiplayer setup, it makes the game frustrating to play as only the main player gets to progress the story while the other player get to do nothing but sit there and wait.

Sorry Nintendo i will stop playing your games now, im truly and deeply saddened by you people.","Couldn\u2019t have come out in a more perfect time. Really enjoy playing it with the family.","Best switch game!!!!Must do gameGood good goodNintendo bestBriliants I do everyday from releasing date","Absolutely amazing! All the customizing is so fun and the graphics are so cute!!","I'll admit, I'm not the best person to ask for a review of this game, but that's only because I haven't gotten to play this game because of Nintendo forcing players to only have one island per console.\r For some quick context, my twin brother bought this game for our birthday and began playing immediately at launch. I watched him play here and there and became interested seeing as neither he or I had ever played an Animal Crossing game before but we both had only heard good things about the series. I decided to let my brother play for a few days on his own before starting up my own save. When I did, I gathered my parents and had them watch me as I figured they too would probably enjoy the game and I wanted to introduce it to them with me so we could have a new bonding experience. To my dismay however, I was able to create my own villager, but not my own island.\r My brother has done nothing but tell me how much fun the game is, with my friends and the Internet echoing his praises. And yet unless I decide to fork over an extra $360 to purchase a new switch and copy of the game, I will be locked out of this game's full experience.\r While this may seem like a bold claim to some, when you have a game centered around a small island, and then make players share that one island per console, you are essentially making them share a save file. Maybe I wouldn't be so upset about this fact if it wasn't common for every other game on the switch to allow multiple save files per console account.\r I have heard the argument that this has always been a feature in the animal crossing series, to which I say, look at Pokemon. When Pokemon transitioned to the switch, they dropped having only one save per device, and people are now able to experience the newest Pokemon games with multiple saves. I don't see any logical reason why Animal Crossing is unable to make the same transition.\r I'd also like to bring up the argument of target demographics. While it is true that the Animal Crossing series has always been able to connect with a wide audience and demographic, which is what makes the series so great I'm told, I still imagine that the target audience of this game series is children, seeing as the game contains a cute cartoony art style and is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB, allowing children to also experience the game. I can't imagine the arguments going on in households that contain multiple children right now over who gets to play on the island and who gets to do what on the island.\r The bottom line here is that Nintendo is shooting themselves in the foot by not including multiple islands as this both angers old fans and limits the amount of new players able to experience the game. The hardware is clearly there, seeing as every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves across Switch accounts, including old games that didn't before moving to the Switch like Pokemon.\r At the beginning of this review I said I'm not the best reviewer of this game seeing as I've been unable to play it. But for that reason alone, I'm rating this game 1 out of 10. I can see no logic in this choice of only allowing one island per console. I was really excited to try this series out for the first time, only to have that excitement squashed due to Nintendo limiting it's player base for this new game. I don't doubt the game is good, I just wish I could play it along with everyone else.","Only ONE island per switch? Are you guys crazy? Already having a hard enough time finding room for new villagers. I've been busily working my island, filling every quadrant with farms, crafting areas with laid out, organized supplies, surplus of fish and shells, furniture arranged in cute little areas, grottos and meadows, decorative flowers as well as areas devoted to crossbreeding, I've carefully placed every single tree... And then my brother wants to play. I'd love for him to. Well, can't bc I've set my whole island. Also crappy that another player can come in and just put their house wherever, with the option of deleting whatever is in that area. Also a dumb choice with the nook mile quests. Chip down a tree. Plant a tree. Plant flowers. Etc. I want my island to be my own. At least in previous games you had the choice of swapping memory cards or cartridges. Huge disappointment and just looks money grubby on Nintendo part. Want your own island? Buy another switch! Yeah right/enjoy the negative reviews from angry consumers, Nintendo.","I spent days ignoring negative feedback and wondering why I couldnt make progress in the game. Turns out anyone aside from the first person to arrive at the island can't do jack. All I can do is collect sticks and bugs. This is a massively disappointing experience. No game here.","**** this greedy, piece of **** corporate bull**** company. The one island per switch is the most blatantly greedy move ever. Their argument was to have multiple players work together to build the island, which sounds great on paper, but the second player literally cannot do jack **** to contribute to the island. So not only did they not allow multiple islands, they also did not follow up on a viable alternative.  What a bunch of scumbags.They are using EA as a role model and only thinking about profits rather than user experience. I will not be purchasing a single switch game anymore from now on. Good thing PS5 is coming out soon.","it's painfully slow and boring, it's not fun at all and personally does not win me over with their  \"cute\" character designs. maybe I'm not the right deomgraphic","Only one island per console? Way to capitalize Nintendo...definately not worth it.","Being restricted to one island per system is absolutely infuriating for a game like this. The island is too small/resources scarce to add other players and progress is tied to the first person who made the account. Now only one member of my household can play the game and  ever and it\u2019s really terrible. I understand that this was a feature of the older games, but it is one of the worst features I have ever experienced with any game for this particular one.","This game was an utter let down. I\u2019ve been playing games all my life but never had the chance to play any games in the animal crossing series. My girlfriend was overtly excited about this new game and I figured I would purchase this for her and I could enjoy something refreshing and new. She plays all day when I bought it and I tried to start my own island the following day. One island per switch is crap and I\u2019m not even going to try and play this game. You lost a potential player. I made an account on Metacritic strictly to relay my disgust.","I'm sure this is a great game if you live on your own or have a Switch all to yourself. If you don't; well, bad news - this is basically a one player per console kinda deal. If you have kids or share a console with a loved one - don't waste your money on this.","Improves on the premise of the old games well while adding all new mechanics. Having tons of fun so far, and leaving this review mostly to combat the idiots review bombing over the small flaws this game has.","Absolutely ridiculous that two players can't have their own individual islands on a current gen system. There is absolutely zero reason that such a limitation should exist beyond greed. Nintendo support actually told me to \"buy a second system.\" Are you kidding me? Buy a second video game console if I want to be able to fully experience a game just like my fiance on our switch? Is Nintendo out of their minds?\r So be prepared, my fiance is the \"island representative\" or whatever because she played first. She gets to progress the game, she gets to name the island, she gets to build stuff. I just get to follow and wander around like an advanced NPC. Oh, and island resources spawn ridiculously slowly, so if she plays before me on what's her island that I'm pretty much a guest on, I'm just SoL unless she leaves some for me. I don't even feel like there is a point in me playing this\r I'm sure she would say it's a 10/10 experience, but it's a 0/10 for me because I get some halfbaked version for my money and can't experience the full version with my own profile on the console and my own save files.\r I was so excited for this. I bought my switch for this a few months ago. What an embarrassment for Nintendo to pull this.","If more than one person wants to play this game on the same switch you are out of luck. The game limits you to one island per switch and if you are not the first person to join then you are a side character who cant make any decisions or progress the game in any way.","Seriously? My wife started the game and I came on as second player. I can't do squat to push the game forward and must wait for her to play to do anything. Absolute failure on Nintendo's part. Complete bs I can't get my money back...","My boyfriend bought this game for us to play together but since there's only one island per console we ended up competing for resources/accomplishments until he gave up because he wanted me to have fun playing it rather than him.","I loved the game the truth the best of saga the ones that put the bad rating are the same burns sony","My whole family was very excited for this game. We were willing to accept the whole one island game even though it sucks. My problem is that only the Creator of the island gets the whole game. Since my husband made the island he's getting all these cool quests! Build and furnish 3 houses, place a bridge, a store etc. Everyone else can just collect things. That's it. Collect and build a house. I'm an adult, not a 3 year old. So a game with no goals is bumming me out. At this point I would rather have an island of my own.","Second player limitations is ridiculous. Shared island should have shared responsibilities. Second player has no motivation in the game because you are hindered based on player 1s progress. You cant contribute to projects, receive extra nook miles for completing task, or receive cool DIYs because only player 1 receives them.","I would agree with most reviews that having a very ... Messed up multiplayer system is bad and will move people away. However I would say if you love old animal crossing then your in luck and all that old goodness is here. However if your wanting something more substantial or have a narrative to keep you entertained intrigued why you're locked at home I'm sorry you're not going to find it. This game is more meant for doing very small monotonous things think of it almost like stardew valley and if you're not really into games like that then it doesn't get much better and it is slowly starting to bore me to tears and I can't see any reason keep playing after 5 days I'm sorry","In all honesty, the game is up to the usual par of nintendo quality, however, the local co op multiplayer might as well not exist. If you're looking to play with a partner, friend, family member, etc. don't expect more than simply running around behind them the whole time. It's confusing to me why they even put this option in, it's completely useless and ruins the experience.","I actually just made a metacritic account just to review this game. This would be an almost perfect game if it wasn't for the one island per switch feature mixed with the first player to log in be in control of the entire game's progression for all players. This is an increasing issue if you actually have 8 players on the same switch.\r Each of the 8 players should have the ability to create their own island and be the representative of that island, controlling all progression of that island. Additionally, players on the same switch should be able to buy houses on other players islands on the same switch. This would allow a player to have full control over one island and it's progression, and then also have up to 7 additional houses across 7 other islands on that switch console.\r I enjoy playing on the shared island, but the locked island progression and missing out on that progression is killer to this game. The current system lets player 1 get the full game, with all other players only objective is to complete nook miles.\r Worst part is there was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control. I think that is the most disappointing aspect of this situation.","I really enjoy this game. I bought it as soon as it came out and started up my island. That evening my sister decided to pop in and play with me. We were baffled at the limitations of the second player. As we've progressed I keep finding things that she cannot do or participate in. I hate that she feels left out or completely unable to play with me. Very annoying and sad.","It would be a great game, if you would be able to create a new island for every player. But this way it's just not acceptable.","Not a REAL multiplayer game!  Do not buy as a family game or you will have frustrated players.  Only the first islander can play this game fully.  All additional players can only play a partial version of the full game.  They need to FIX THIS BUG!  I bought this for my family and only 1 person gets access to play the full game.  Would not have bought if I had known and I have loved AC for years!","Seriously could have been one of the best Animal Crossing expierences yet, till the shameless and relentless greed of Nintendo is once again thrown back in your face the moment you realize in order to have more than one island, you need more than one switch. Cmon, really... not cool","I am currently playing this game single player however I feel compelled to review this game based on the multiplayer experience. The decision to lock the game to one island per console is nothing short of a cash grab. I am a long time Nintendo fan since I received a SNES for Christmas as a child but this behavior disgusts me and I am reluctant to spend any more money with this company if they do not address this problem. Nintendo consoles have always been family focused machines that encourage multiplayer and this seems to go against everything they have ever done to date.\r Sadly they have likely already sold enough units to cover costs and will simply ignore the outrage from their customers.","Fix the multiplayer and it\u2019d be a 10, this game is great but with a fundamentally broken multiplayer it\u2019s almost useless in regards to the original purchase reasoning. Close to impossible to have meaningful play with my significant other and children. Need the option to designate other players are island representatives with full control and ability.","0/10. The game has a wonderful ambience and, for a new player as I am, I'm liking it. But it deserves a 0 because I'm NOT GOING TO BUY ANOTHER SWITCH for every sibling that wants to play on my console. People should stop buying this game until multiple islands are allowed. Hope this decision ends the saga and kills the fanbase 'cause it was developed for selling consoles and not for the consumer. (Even more ridiculous, I did purchased 2 copies of the game, but it doesn't matter, they WANT you to BUY a new switch)","Only one Island per switch. Secondary Switch profiles cannot make their own world, they can only play the game if they use the first world created. A stupid limitation. I'd return this game if I could.","Horrible game!!! Wanted to try because of all the hype but it's the most boring game I've ever had the displeasure of playing. I have no idea why this game is getting so much praise. Gave it an honest go and paid full price but I guess it's just not for me. If you don't mind super slow games then you'll probably be able to get into it.","The game is completely broken for me since there's only one island and I have to wait for the island rep to progress. Nintendo really screwed this one up.","Game is nice as a whole, really like the upgraded museum. With that being said however there was no reason why friend island could not have transferred over from new leaf to new horizons except for lazy ness.","I'm sure my girlfriend would give a better review as her experience of the game has been unhindered by having the first turn at our new purchase of Animal Crossing. However, neither of us realised that we'd have to share an island, and as the initial player, her character gets the full experience of the game. However, I get to miss out on building up the island, contributing to key parts of the campaign and missing out on key information including items/recipes that prevent me from accessing whole areas of the game. She currently has to mail me a frigging ladder at the end of her turn. We have different schedules and frankly this sucks. Don't bother with this version of the game if you will be sharing it with someone who does not have their own Switch. Nintendo, please explain this dumbass move.","Don\u2019t understand why this game is being blasted for only one island per console it\u2019s been this was through every single AC game ever. This game is a giant step up from the previous titles because of the gameplay and the graphics","I haven\u2019t played an Animal Crossing game in the past, but with the self-quarantine going on I figured buying this game to enjoy with my siblings would be a great way to pass the time. We planned on playing on our own worlds and had heard that there was a way to visit each other\u2019s local islands. However, we were met with a restriction on our fun that drastically contrasts a game in this style. There is only  ONE island per CONSOLE. Yes, that\u2019s right, you can only make ONE island on each Nintendo Switch. It doesn\u2019t matter if you switch accounts. The higher ups over at Nintendo have decided that with this $60 purchase you are granted ONE little island. But that\u2019s not even the best part! You see, you can in fact join islands locally! Huzzah! But... you can\u2019t progress, you can\u2019t check your inventory, you can\u2019t even walk too far away from the person who made the island. Thanks Nintendo! And so, that leaves my siblings and I in the queue for a refund, and a feeling of disappointment. Surely that can\u2019t be what the developers had wanted right? Well, that\u2019s what they created. This limitation can be interpreted in one of two ways: At worst, a greed-fueled effort led by Nintendo corporate executives to get consumers to buy more than one Switch, so that you can have more than one island, or at best, a way to bring players together locally so that they can learn what a leader and a follower is, and where player 2 fits into that equation. Goodbye Animal Crossing, my siblings and I wish we had the chance to enjoy your content, but you had other plans.","The game at its heart is fun, while also looking the best this series has ever been. Unfortunately this game doesn't offer anything new. Multiplayer is a sad excuse, if you visit an island of a friend and want to help build forget it. This game limits you interactions. Then there is 1 island per console. Saves are tied to that console. So if you damage or lose your switch your progress is gone. These factors way into this rating for a game that has the potential to be an 8/10.","**** greedy game design ruined my opinion of Nintendo and Animal Crossing. Needs more than one island per switch or AT LEAST an option to move characters and change primary. They patched a hack but left in game ruining bugs. A very fun game overall but not reccommended for families.","I got this game for my wife for her birthday and realized that there was a multiplayer. I'm sure more people than me realize this is a let down. The follower is just that and as such doesn't get to do much of anything fun. I also quickly realized that just being the second player to arrive on the island means you don't get to make any decisions. The primary player gets all of the good recipes and gets to advance the plot. Others do not. I had to even have her make me my own crafting station, as I did not get the recipe. The game is still fun for me, but it is a huge let down in what I'm able to do. It makes me feel like an npc that gets to idle around as the player does things.","One Island. One Island. One Island. One Island. One Island. One Island. One Island. One Island.Nintendo\u2019s greed at its best.","So... My super hot goth gf started playing this game before me, and now I can't play due to this dumb 1 island per switch limit. If I have to choose between my super hot gf and animal crossing, I mean of course I'm choosing animal crossing no doubt, but I shouldn't have to choose. Honestly Sakurai needs to fix his game.\rP.S Sakurai also add tom nook to smash.","Scummy practice limiting local multiplayer to one fun experience and then a second class experience for anyone else who wants to play on that console. Solid effort by Nintendo limiting a user's experience to try and force people to purchase an entirely new console just to play a a game they purchased in its full capacity. Won't work on me.","The limitation of one island per Switch is **** Nintendo should be ashamed of itself....","This game is fun...... if your the first person to play. If your the second or third or so on player than you are pretty much just a visitor that can do basically  much nothing that affects the island. I understand Nintendo that they want to sell more switches and make more money but you are ruining the game for lots of people. This is not ok.","1 snow white seven dwarfs (with no power). Ridiculous. Nintendo knows better than this.","One save limitation is so frustrating, I can't fully enjoy the game therefore I wasted my meny. Don't buy untill this is fixed.","The inability to have different islands in multiple save files fundamentally breaks what would otherwise be an amazing game. Absolutely terrible for families, a stupid marketing decision for such a family friendly game.","Even though it seems like a great game with many items and characters i am put of it by the fact that all people on one switch have to play the same island this makes the game less fun and is ea level of greediness","My wife set up the game so now I play the game on kid mode. Please add multiple save files.","I want to rate this game an 8 or a 9. Nintendo got so many things right. But they've completely ruined it. By not allowing proper couch coop (seriously, I can't be Best Friends with my WIFE, sitting NEXT to me, playing on the same console?) I guess I could get over that. But I can't even make my own island. They want us to buy a whole ass second Switch. Oh, and another copy of the game if we want to play together at the same time. Unacceptable. This game has made me truly furious. We were SO excited to play this and run around together and, you know, actually play the game. Compare our islands. Visit each other's islands. Play together on the same island. But we can't do ANY of that. Beyond frustrating. This is a cash grab worse than I've seen in a long time. Truly disappointing how Nintendo has completely ruined this game for so many people. They've lost a lifetime Nintendo fan. And I've had every console since the original NES. I will never again give them any of my money. Truly heartbreaking.","Animal Crossing has always been a charming, simple game designed to be a relaxing sandbox. New Horizons definitely checks all those boxes, even if it does very little to actually improve on the game's age old formula.\r One thing I see as a big step back (or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon's stubborn refusal to include same-gender relationships while indie games like Stardew Valley do it so well) is the island sharing mechanic. I see a lot of people complaining that anyone who complains about this just wants to be \u00a8boosted\u00a8, to stop whining and enjoy the game. The only logical reasoning is that those people are so entitled that they cannot imagine the game was not made for their sole enjoyment or so socially challenged that they cannot fathom how a family might want to share a console while still having a full gameplay experience for all players.\r While I will not rant on and on about how this is completely unacceptable, it does show that the developers either can't design a game that allows for separate and independent save files (a worrying prospect) or did not imagine that some people might like having their own, separate sandbox experience without either having to limit their own or other people's experience in order to do so, after multiple installments of a very family-friendly game (families usually have more than one people in them, and many will have more than one member interested in the game), which is brings me to believe that while Animal Crossing will always be able to deliver in charm, it will never grow to be better than what it is and will always be.\r This might be the last Animal Crossing game I will purchase, unless I see some effort on their part on actually creating an evolving experience with each game.\r TL,DR: Good and fun, buy if you have your own console, skip it if you have to share with someone else.","If anyone has multi people who want to play this game DO NOT BUY. You can only have one island per switch. First player has full access to the game anyone else is limited.","Let multiple islands happen on a single switch. Unacceptable busy strategy to try and force people to buy more consoles. Truly scum.","Nintendo lo ha vuelto a hacer, Animal Crossing New Horizons es de lo mejor que puedes encontrar en Switch.","Amazing game, gameplay, vibes, ALL OF IT. Don't listen to the whiners leaving 0 star reviews. Well worth the buy - the best AC game yet!","The one island thing is so bad for a family with  2 Kids and a Dad they will all have a alone island...","Great game. Slowly teaches you what to do and makes it more fun then a chore.","If you share your switch and was excited to both play this game, think again. Understandable that you share worlds but as a second player u cannot access the entire game, certain VITAL tools (think shovel and axe???) and upgrades are unavailable, u can't contribute to quests or even upgrade from a tent to a house ????? What the **** Nintendo. Give us the option of 2 islands or at least send DIY packs to the 2nd player so they can play a as well and upgrade their house ???? This is crap. Will have to buy a second switch so we can both play....Get ****ed.","Nintendo, come on. This is the most customizable, most personalize, most progression based animal crossing game ever made. Why why why would you lock everyone into the same island? Because the last games did it? This isn't the last games. It only worked then because the towns were immutable, and progress was tracked separately. You guys completely changed how the game is played, the saves should reflect that. Fix this glaring, obvious issue, and I'll pick up the game.","I hate this game for the local and online that you can play with 8 people together but they can't do anything, don't buy this for family members and think you can play together","Honestly im not sure why alot of people a blowing the fact that you can only have 1 island per switch, ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL","I can't believe the hype of this game. I have never been so bored of repetitive stone hitting, tree chopping, fishing and bug catching. Also the fact you can only have one island is beyond a joke, Nintendo should be ashamed to release this at full price. You should also not need Nintendo online to visit friends islands. This game was made for social interaction, something it tries it's hardest to steer you away from. One other thing is the washed up character on the shores who keeps coming back and making you collect his communicator parts. I have had to do this 7 times in a week. Why on earth could they not think of any other tasks. Everything is mundane and dull and I would seriously avoid. No idea how this got a 91. What a joke.","The greed of Nintendo , you can only make 1 island per console. This is absolutely ridiculous and no reason for it... well for Nintendo the reason is to sell more games and consoles.

Get your s*** together Nintendo and stop being worse than EA.... that is quite a feat to attain. Congrats","Amazing game for player 1, every other player gets the absolute shaft. They miss out on a ton of content because you can only have 1 island per switch, and whoever logs on first gets to make all of the decisions. Player 2 through 8 are basically glorified NPCs. Yeah, you can build a house and sell things.. But that's about it.  You're locked out of advancing the story, you can't build things for new residents, you don't get all of the achievements, it goes on like this. Absolute garbage that you can't get around this by using different profiles. In other versions all you needed was a second memory card. Now if you don't want to pay for an engines system, you don't get to experience the full game.","you can only have one island per switch witch ruins everything if you have a family. Nintendo is a greedy pile of crap for doing this. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!","0 out of 10 because I feel the game deserves a 0 out of 10, not because I'm trying to drag the user score down.\r Only one person can fully play the game per switch, even if multiple people buy their own digital copies. Forcing people to share an island sucks but forcing everyone else to be effectively NPCs in the game is the most blatantly anti-consumer thing I've ever seen in a video game. Out of every single offline game that has released on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, this is the only one that cannot be played by multiple people.","The one island per switch is way of an issue than I'd thought it would be. Others not being able to progress since I haven't played it enough makes it less fun for both them and me.","This game is AWFUL if you plan to share it. 2nd player is useless, they cannot progress the island, nor help build anything. It sucks. The reviewers never even tested this out, shoes how useless they truly are.","We were promised a game that let a family build an island together.  That's a giant load.  Truth is that only one player, and one player EVER is allowed to do anything on the island.  Everyone else gets to watch with the chore of following them around the island.  You can't build shops.  You can't build museums.  You can't build bridges.  You can't build houses for new villagers.\r You can't even help player 1 do any of those things.\r I didn't get the game I was promised.  Not even close.","Bought the game to play it with my BF, he started to play first and now i can't play as a normal character. What happened is that the fact that i play it after him made me a secondary player. This means that i cannot follow the main questline, that i cannot have some base items (such as axe, for example) and that i can't participate in any of the changes that could be made if this was my own island. So, every other games lets you have your own savegame, so every account has a personal game, this is not the case; in animal crossing, if you want to have your own game (in an home console such as it is) you have to buy another switch (250 bucks). Thank you nintendo for not letting me play the game as a normal player. You have to fix this asap because we can't have to talk of this ridicolous design choice in 2020.","Animal Crossing as a game is as wonderful as it ever has been. The new features IN THE GAMEPLAY are fun and welcome. However, I own two Nintendo Switches (OG and Lite) bought the game hoping for cloud saves, no dice. So I set up on the family OG switch, not knowing you may only have ONE ISLAND per console. This has locked my wife and son out of the game for pacing and my son who typically wakes up early to play consumes all the island resources. Ultimately I could just restart on the lite but that would lock me out of the TV side which I enjoy. So the solution would not be to buy another copy of the game it would be to buy a another full switch console. This makes my rating of the game go from a 9-10 to a 2. Another thing which I don't think many have addressed: If I (the first person to play) quits playing the island progression stops too for my son. So in effect I'm sticking with it for the child...","One island per Switch is an anti-consumerist decision made in an attempt to boost hardware sales. My girlfriend and I are forced to share the same island, which isn't terrible in and of itself. However, as the first person to start the game I am designated the \"Resident Representative\". As the second player, she cannot progress the tutorial. She cannot make any decisions that shape the island. This is a half-baked experience for anybody other than the first player on the island. If your Resident Representative isn't as active as you, or even decides to stop playing the game, good luck! You'll never, ever progress past wherever they left off.\r We are quite well off and could easily afford another Switch. We will never buy another Switch, because it is a CONSOLE and not a PERSONAL DEVICE like a cell phone.\r Change the game to allow each profile to have their own island.","What's wrong with people here? All this outrage for the 1 Switch = 1 Island is nonsense, first of all Nintendo was very clear about this so people acting surprised about it have only themself to blame, but also every single Animal Crossing before was like this, so how is possible the best one of the series is the one getting bombed? Ridiculous. If you are the secondary player you still get like 90% of the experience and you are supposed to talk with your family and organize yourselves to make the important choices and share the resources, how is this so hard? And how is people judging the gameplay experience so negatively after just 1-2 days of gameplay? This game is not designed to be fully enjoyed on a couple of days. Grow up, the game is fantastic so far.","I usually don't write reviews to fight other people's reviews but this is different.\r(If you want to find more useful information you should read other positive reviews. This is more like an answer to all those negative ones.)\rThis is not like Pok\u00e9mon where they removed content and features to sell it back and increased the base price for the games or something and where I could understand where people were coming from with their opinions.\rBut with Animal Crossing New Horizons people seem to like being angry about something that isn't new at all. Having only one island per console is something Nintendo has done for all previous Animal Crossing games in some form.\r AC for GC: *only 1 town per memory card*\rAC for DS: *only 1 town per game*\rAC for Wii: *only 1 town per system*\rAC for 3DS: *only 1 town per game/system*\rAC for Switch: *only 1 island per system*\r The only difference was the way that each device handled save files. So yes, it sometimes had some benefits to how it handled them but that isn't the point. The point is that Nintendo always wanted people to play together in one town. It has nothing to do with something like Nintendo forcing you to buy more consoles. People, please. Use your brain... You also couldn't move the save file from the Wii to an SD card. People never complained about those issues so obviously Nintendo didn't see the need to change it. So why is it now all of a sudden that surprising to everyone?\r And about the thing that only the founder of the island can make progression: That only applies to the \"story\" progression like building the museum etc. After the first week (if you do everything in that pace) everyone can do everything (more or less, I'm not that far yet so I cannot guarantee it, I just read it in a review. But nobody else, especially the people complaining, seem to have done some research before complaining about it, since I don't believe that you are that far in the game yet that you can even know that much about the game.\r Coop is completely knew to this game and in previous games if other players wanted to have a turn, they had to wait until the other person finished theirs. Now you can play together at the same time. Yes, I also would have liked to play in split screen so that's a negative point I would give. But 0 points for those things is just dumb.\r Don't get me wrong, I also would like for people to be able to have their own island if they choose to but the way people are acting here is just stupid. It's not greed, it's not Nintendo trying to force us buying more consoles. It's just Nintendo asking us to play together on one island, sharing and caring for each other. You can like it or dislike it. I understand going down with your personal score, yes. But going down to 0 is just pure hate from you being angry that devs don't make YOUR perfect game. That's not how reviews work.\r( I know I do the same but backwards that's why you should read the first sentence again :P )","There are no words to describe the flawlessly, gorgeous graphics and detail that have gone into creating this game. As an Animal Crossing fan that has played every game since gamecube, I am utterly amazed at how far the series has come. Does it have a little bit different feel? Yes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable than any of the other games I've played in the series. I have read all other people's reviews and the people giving it a bad review either new absolutely nothing about the series or did absolutely zero research before purchasing the game. I would give this game a solid 10/10 but I have to give it a 9 just because the game seems to start out more slowly than any of the others in the series and parts of the game feel a little more like work and more tedious than previous games. I would have liked the game to have started out with at least 3 villagers instead of 2 but all these things are very little complaints. Overall, the game is great and I look forward to playing it every day for the next several years to come!","Unable to create more than 1 island per switch and no option to even move game data to be able to get around this. A complete cash grab to force you to buy another switch and game to be able to enjoy the game to its fullest if multiple people want to play.","Nintendo is forcing people to buy two switches and two games. They put in blockers to make the second player feel frustrated. There is limited things the second player can do it is makes for a bad experience.\r Local multiplayer is terrible also.\r If you have two kids or want to the player with another profile then don't buy this game. This game was made for 1 player using only 1 profile. If multiple people will play this game then DON'T BUY IT!!!!","I have my own Switch, so I have nothing to complain about. The game is amazing and I absolutely love it. It was worth buying on day 1.\rEdit:\r Now after a while the charm of the game faded away a bit, but it surely paid itself out throughout 260 hours I have invested in it. It was a perfect companion during the pandemic times.","Pocas novedades respecto al anterior e incluso se echan en falta minijuegos. El apartado gr\u00e1fico es correcto, cumple y poco mas. Un juego casual para jugar tranquilamente y ver como van pasando las horas sin apenas enterarte.","This game is amazing.I'm a fan of animal crossing serise.When I heard new animal crossing in switch, I'm worried because previous game is very good.However, This game is really good.must play.","This game is completely awesome if you are the only one playing on a single switch. But having to share a switch and second players being degraded to a lesser status of not being able to progress the island completely ruins the two player experience on the same switch. Don\u2019t plan on two people playing equally on the same switch.","This entry into the franchise is clearly the best animal crossing experience to date. However, due to the role of Resident Representative the shared island design is robbed of cooperation and a sense of community essential to the game. A lack of option for multiple islands offers no work-around for this issue, making the game almost unplayable for the many families with multiple equal users on one Switch. Please fix these monumental issues., Nintendo.","Very limited for households with multiple players. No option to create your own island and being the 2nd player to start means you miss out on most of the story parts of the game, and you have to wait for the 1st player to progress things before you can really do anything. It's a bit ridiculous and comes across as a money grab from nintento, trying to get people to buy multiple switch consoles and games per house. Very disappointing","Doesn't let you play with multiple accounts like advertised. Let my boyfriend play for a bit before I got home because he was curious what the game was about only to find out I couldn't even then play the game I payed for! Absolutely disgracefully and deceitful.  Sent in a ticket and it was closed saying that is  how it is designed to be and to buy another console and game if we both want to play.... Game is not worth almost $300!!! I regret spending even $60 on it!","The game should be called Animal Crossing: New Horizons For Player One As Any Other Player Is Gated From Any Progress And The Game Becomes Absolutely Pointless For Him After Day One Oh And Also You Can Have Only One Island Per Console So Buy More Consoles And Give Us Your Money Sincerely Yours Nintendo (P.S. We Don't Give A **** About Your Experience) but that would not attract so many players I think.\r Yes, this is a review-bomb, because the whole point of the game was to play it with my girlfriend and the one thing the game prevents you from doing is to play it with other person (except local coop, but that's not what I'm looking for).\r Besides that - the game is cute and addictive but comparing it to Stardew Valley which I just saw my girlfriend playing this lacks the depth and content of SV. Might be wrong though, I'm only day 4.","Bought to ply with my girlfriend, we cannot have our own island, the first who starts play becomes the main character. Any other players that begins a new game will becom A SECONDARY CHARACTER, this means that he will gets a \"lite\" version of the game which don't let you to do the main questline, to build things, to have main recipes. Actually you can only catch bugs and fish. Any other game lets you have distinct save games for account (even Pokemon, and all of you know how this is strange), this is not the case of animal crossing that, if you want to play with your own island you have to BUY ANOTHER SWITCH.\rYou have to fix this as soon as possible.","Game is unplayable as a second account. Constant progress locks and zero say in island customization completely ruins the experience.

From the music to the visuals this game is just so cute and fun on so many levels and I cant wait to sink my teeth into more.Also to the whiny little **** review bombing maybe try following the directs and advertising as Nintendo never hid the fact it was one island per Switch. Please cry more. The true fans are too busy enjoying themselves to give a damn.10/10 not the best game ever but addictive and fun.","I'm going to be generous and give this game a 1. I have waited nearly TEN YEARS for a brand new Animal Crossing game and after all these years of developing and planning I find out that they decided NOT to give Isabelle a double barrel shot gun and include ZERO demons. Worst. Crossover. Ever. NintenDOOMED.","In addition to the absolutely ridiculous stunt Nintendo pulled by forcing you to have to buy AN ENTIRE NEW CONSOLE IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON WANTS TO PLAY THE GAME, the game is boring and not rewarding at all. It feels like a mobile game because you can barely do anything before running out of things to do. At least in mobile games they give you the option to pay money to progress. Harvest Moon: AWL is way better than this game and it came out over a decade ago. Animal Crossing has to be one of the most overrated games of all time.","Love this game! It has a lot more features than New Leaf, and really keeps you busy the whole time. Be warned that you can only have one island per Switch, and the first player account to play gets more tasks to do. I don\u2019t see this as an issue though because New Leaf only had one mayor per town... so it seems fine to me. People poorly reviewing the game are just mad that they would have to have multiple switches in order to have multiple islands.","Definitely the most expansive and fun Animal Crossing entry! All my expectations were surpassed.","10/10 si juegas te enganchas como nunca a otro juego. Mejorando AC NEW LEAF","Honestly the best game so far! Please stop review bombing just because of the cloud saves/one Island thing, it isn't fair to the rest of the game","Super cute, but as a second player I cannot do anything and there is no point to even playing the game. It is ludicrous that in order to create my own island and actually play the game I have to get a second switch. Really?  Solid money grab, Nintendo. BOO","I'm already addicted to the game.\rPros:\rThe graphics are gorgeous, the items keep me interested in collecting, but I don't feel the need to rush through everything in order to do so. I love the character interactions and the animations are very cute.\rCons:\rThe RNG could probably be more balanced? Some of the UI could have been more streamlined. I see why people are upset about the lack of content for a second islander, but to me, it feels the same as how New Leaf operated, one character making all the decisions while the others build up their own stuff. Though maybe I'm biased since I have no-one to share the island with except filler characters anyway. Definitely a bit short-sighted decision wise, but not as greedy as some other companies.","This game is amazing, people who rate it low are idiots, they should know what it's about and how it works, Nintendo were telling you how the one island per console works months ago! This game is great and the best animal crossing yet!","This is a wonderful game for old fans and new fans. You also have the choice to pick your villagers later on and where they stay so certain spots you like or have set up won\u2019t be ruined.To the people complaining about only having one island per system, this has literally been apart of animal crossing since it\u2019s first game it\u2019s not new and probably having multiple save files like some other games probably would not work with the actual clock it uses which is your game system\u2019s clock.","Fantastic in every way. Never played the any of the previous games and if they're a fraction as good as this, then I missed out!","While the one island per switch conundrum can be problematic to the game\u2019s family audience, the game itself is phenomenal and visually beautiful. The amount of love and effort put into this game causes the environment, soundtrack, and character to pop out of the screen. The ambience is breathtaking, and the writing is some of the best in the series thus far. While Nintendo has had many problems in the past, the amount of love put into New Horizons pays off in various ways. The previously-mentioned one island per switch conundrum is just that: a problem. The restriction is not, however, a game-ruining characteristic.","Have played every Animal Crossing game that's come out, and this one is absolutely the best. Looks great, lots of fun already, and with updates coming to add even more!","This game its minor flaws but the experience of playing AC has never been this great. Amazing game overall.","L'impossibilit\u00e0 di creare pi\u00f9 di un'isola per console rende sostanzialmente impossibile giocare al gioco a pi\u00f9 di una persona per console. E questo \u00e8 veramente grave per le famiglie, come la mia, all'interno delle quali la switch \u00e8 condivisa da pi\u00f9 persone. Siccome la switch viene pubblicizzata come console da famiglia trovo veramente assurda e poco professionale questa scelta e pretendo venga corretta il prima possibile con una patch. In quel caso provveder\u00f2 a correggere la mia recensione e a dare il giusto voto a questo gioco, che \u00e8 certamente pi\u00f9 che ottimo.","An amazing game as always Nintendo! Don\u2019t let the review bombers get to you, this is a must have for the Nintendo switch","One island per console, no matter how many copies of the game are purchased? The pinnacle of greed. You expect low income families with multiple kids to buy multiple Switch\u2019s? Get real.","For all those people complaining about one town per switch it must suck to suck. Jeez, if I had someone else in my household that wanted to play switch I'd get them their own regardless of if it was for animal crossing or another game. I like having my own save data and it's not like two switches aren't basically the same price as the other main consoles or anything?? Lol not denying that having multiple people on one switch, one island doesn't kinda suck compared to the rest of it there are just easy ways around the issue. Wouldn't you want your own personal switch? Playing coop is one thing but why share the console fully/directly?Game is 10/10","Best game so far this year, people need to stop review bombing games over something so small and petty!","These negative reviews are insane! This is easily one of the greatest games released for the switch to date. Playable hours will easily match and exceed games like BOTW.","I was so excited to get this game for me and my kids. We all have enjoyed the AC games for years now. Imagine my and my youngest child's disappointment when we realized that the game my oldest created was now the ONLY iteration of the game we can play on.\r The early Nintendo games packed tons of story and gameplay on tiny cartridges, but now with gigabytes of data available Nintendo made the decision to lock an entire console to one saved game. If they don't update the game to allow multiple saves--an easy fix with today's technology--I'll stop buying from them. The used cartridge market is alive and well if we really want a Switch game. Besides, there are tons of indie computer games available. I'm tired of supporting greedy gaming giants.","This game should be punished for ruining the multiplayer user experience in the name of increasing their console sales. This is not, and should not be acceptable to the current industry regardless of the quality of solo game. Consoles that have such heavily integrated user accounts and such profound multiplayer capability should not restrict users usage to one save per console.\rWake up consumers and set consumer boundaries!! Wake up Nintendo and stop abusing the system for your sales!! Show us you actually DO CARE and CHANGE THIS ONE SAVE PER CONSOLE ATROCITY!","So I payed around 300 for a brand new Switch console, 37 bucks or something for an annual online family plan, 64 bucks for the game, 75 bucks or something for a second controller, and you're telling me my wife and I can't access the same progression and island control features. That's about the greediest thing I've seen in a while. That's ridiculous Nintendo. Thank you. It's a shame because this game is beautiful, relaxing, and cute. But the limitations to the second player are completely experience killing.","If you plan on having multiple users playing this game, DONT BUY IT. For whatever reason the original creator of the island is only given access to progressing in the game. Every other user that plays is purely cosmetic and has no purpose in playing as they cannot progress. This ridiculous feature needs to be patched in a future update as it literally ruins the game for everyone except the registered users.","If you are the first person to boot up the game you basically are the only person that will have fun playing the game.If you are the second person you realize that what you get to do is extremely limited compared to the first person. Every profile should get their own island. If you are the second person to play you lose opportunities. Like building structures. Having a say in the towns name. And it's harder for you to get resources to build things. If it wasn't for these problems this game would be a easy 10/10I doubt that they will fix this problem because nintendo never does. So if you have a family that all want to play this game is a pass.","Game Seems solid EXCEPT FOR ONE INSURMOUNTABLE FLAW. there are 3 people in this house that want to play but only 1 switch console , the way the game has been designed to deliberately force them all on to the same island with no option for them to have their own games is making them all fight. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN AND ONLY ONE SWITCH. it has been designed to cause conflict. it is the opposite of what you want when your trapped in a house under quarantine and everyone is already getting on each others nerves.\r tl;dr\r DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN AND 1 CONSOLE.  IT WILL CAUSE FIGHTS","Don\u2019t listen to the whining pu-c\u2019s who didn\u2019t read up on the multiplayer before buying the game. It\u2019s not Nintendo\u2019s fault they are dumb. The core experience of this game is fun as can be. If you don\u2019t cheat it this game can last years and there is no \u201cend\u201d to it. If you never played any animal crossing games this is the best one to start with. Very easy to learn and tons to do if you enjoy it.","Charming production values and I can understand the overall appeal, but this game is marred by the most atrocious, backward, moronic UX I\u2019ve ever experienced in a video game. Each conversation with an NPC is the same excruciating exchange. It\u2019s like they designed the game to annoy you. Also, why would you want to buy a chore simulator such as this when the dishes need doing, the ironing needs ironing, and you haven\u2019t called your mother in 3 weeks.\r If you want to jump on the bandwagon, buy it for your little sister, let her build her island, watch her play a bit, and maybe visit with your own character. Then totally avoid it, because it really is like living inside a pre-adolescent girl\u2019s brain. They could have made this game so much better but I think they are hemmed in by their fan base. Don\u2019t reward the developers with your hard-earned cash. It will only encourage them further.","The one island per switch rule is terrible and a horrible money grabby thing to do. Please fix this!","The most cynical cash grab tactic I've ever seen in gaming. Only one island per console is purely there to drive console and game sales. Never buying Nintendo again","I came in as a new person to the franchise and I find myself having fun with it. The zen style of gameplay is a nice change from the usual, though I wish they put more thought into this games as the design of some aspects seem short sighted.\r Most jarringly at first I noticed was the 5am gates. Any time you progress the island a step, the game will lock any further progression behind a 5am tomorrow gate. Mind you this isn't real time, as it will unlock at 5am tomorrow regardless of when you hit the gate. This makes certain buildings a chore, most notably the museum. You get gated after 5 donations to Tom then  after 15 more donations to Blathers, which is then followed by a mandatory 24h construction period. This process takes 48 to 72 hours depending on when you made the first 5 donations, which feels annoying because you need to hold onto any discoveries you find for that time.\r Next is progression, which for the most part punishes you for doing so. A good example of this is buying from Timmy &amp; Tommy. At the start of the game you can buy &amp; sell from them freely until you get Nook's Cranny. When you do you can only buy &amp; sell normally until 10pm, you can sell using the box at any time with it only being 80% of normal selling price. This detail annoys me so much. If the shop hours was going to be a thing, why not have it always be like that? That way it doesn't feel like they are restricting features or selling for less because you are past the time-frame. The box could have been a positive feature by letting you sell past close time, but instead it's just presented in a way that punishes the player.\r The tool system isn't much different. Tools break and there are stronger versions available for the right material, but they never change the act of collecting and can actually be a downgrade if the player isn't careful. This can be seen with the iron axe, which doesn't increase the amount of wood dropped and instead will chop down a tree on the 3rd hit, preventing it from growing again and stopping you from collecting wood. There is no reason to use the iron axe over the stone one, which offers the same amount of drops without destroying the source and still offers a fair amount of hits. If you do want to move a tree, just use shovel + fruit which actually put it into your inventory to move/sell.\r There are other odd details that haven't impacted me much as a solo player being the only one on my switch, but having a single island per console is really not fun since if you want to try local multiplayer you need to place additional tents down on your island to do so. Multiplayer isn't that well explained by the game in general. Overall I do like the game, but the design clashes a lot with the zen game it's trying to be.\r Bunny Day Update: Oh boy I do like being able to progress even less because of eggs appearing instead of needed materials. This game already has too much rng.","Absolute turd game design. Why does only the first player get the full game experience? I don't mind 1 island per console, every Animal Crossing has done that. It makes the game more interesting to indirectly interact with the other people in your household playing the game. What's inexcusable is that only the first player can advance the game forward.","This is very addictive and colorful game with awfully slow dialogue system, horrible online multiplayer. Looks like developers haven't heard of internet existing. If 7 if your friends will visit your island be ready to spend about a half an hour just to arrival animation. In the end I love Animal Crossing but horrible online, unskippable dialogues, lack of cloud saves etc drive me MAD!\r Do not buy it!","I would have given the game an 8 except Nintendo thinks they're being slick by limiting one island per console.  I bought the game for my son and I cannot advance the game because ONLY the first person to play the game can propel the island level forward.  My son is prone to taking anything I leave outside my house; I can only imagine how that would go down with multiple kids playing on the same system.","Simplemente es un gran juego, mi esposa no deja de jugar, muchas de las quejas de juegos anteriores fueron escuchadas, es un juego infinito, no tiene limites ni fin, mi esposa simplemente amo el juego, eso si veo a muchos sonyers con su mala nota por que su Humo Stranding tiene menor calificaci\u00f3n, como sea AL es un vende consolas y es un juegazo","Love this game, so chill so nice. I will be sinking huge amounts of hours into this game.","I am one of those who were negatively affected by the whole resident representative thing; it is super inconvenient because it caught me off guard since I didn't know that this is going all \"New Leaf Mayor\" situation again. Though I am honestly really glad that I can share the island with my siblings, but that being said, it should be completely optional whether you want to share the island or not. Finally, I don't really get why everyone are assuming Nintendo's intentions behind this decision; this was a thing for as long as I remember in the Wii days (Probably even GameCube?) to share the island/neighborhood with local users, and obviously Nintendo's intentions weren't for you to go buy another Wii; it was purely a game design decision that has nothing to do with forcing people to buy another console, and no one really complained about this in the past as much as now and that's why they never considered adding the \"feature\" of having multiple islands per console since they assumed that what's not broken doesn't need fixing. The game is fantastic and we really love it, and I really don't think that a red color is needed for Nintendo to notice everyone's feedback.","I am new to the series, but find it very enjoyable. The more I play of it, the more I want to play. It is very addictive gameplay. Nintendo has another gem on the Switch!","Update Review:\rAfter buying this same since launch, I honestly thought the newest Animal Crossing game would be better than it's predecessors. However, New Horizons fails to impress after completing the various set of objectives. The updates may have addressed the issues we wanted but the one Island system still exists while we rarely see new things being added. These updates only added special temporary events which did not give me an incentive to go back. Unfortunately, this game is lacking variety compared to New Leaf and City Folk. I feel like this game isn't living up to the hype especially to people who have devoted their lives to the franchise. I hardly hate to say this but this game is honestly a bargain bin to me.","I love it.The progress is slow but that is normal for AC.... It is Relaxing and I found new friends","While I think the in home multi-player stuff is aittle borked, the game is GORGEOUS and so very very enjoyable otherwise.","One island per console? What were they thinking! My wife and I wasted $65 on a game that only one of us can enjoy completely. What an absolute ripoff.","The game is great! I love playing online with my friends and developing my town, so cute and gorgeous!","The perfect game has come out at the perfect time. The days are moving quick.","I love half of this game and hate of it. It feels like they've added in numerous extra steps to get to the fun parts. Honestly the crafting mechanic is a terrible addition. There was a real turning point while I was chopping my 20th tree that day; my axe broke and I saw that the requirements to make another axe meant I had to use the very wood I was collecting to make fun things. It actually just made me feel weary, I turned it off there and then and sold the game. Pretty disappointed","Nie mo\u017cna wi\u0119cej ni\u017c jeden wyspy stworzy\u0107Jebac chuji z nintendoOpis musi mie\u0107 75 znak\u00f3w","When I first heard about the Animal Crossing series, I had seen tid bits from some youtubers and talks about New Leaf and Pocket Camp. I got Pocket Camp on IOS and played it for a maximum of 20 minutes. It was simple and bland and turned me off the series while i still respected it. I thought it just wasn\u2019t for me. Boy was I wrong (And i should\u2019ve assumed that the mainline games were much better than the free mobile game). When Animal Crossing New Horizons was revealed, i thought it looked charming and was interested in giving it a go and i\u2019m so glad i did. So far this game has been a magical experience. Watching the deserted island grow into a thriving society is very satisfying. Gameplay is so calming but also engaging. The game starts slow and  progresses while you complete tasks, fish, catch bugs, pick weeds, and build houses for upcoming residents. If i could say one thing to new players: It\u2019s ok if you feel like you\u2019ve done everything you need to for the day and feel like you should put the game down. This game is all about patience which can sometimes be frustrating but also very rewarding. Some days, once you\u2019ve done your daily tasks like gather materials and talking to the villagers, there\u2019s not much else to do and you have to wait until the next day where more stuff will be available. This game is designed to be played over several months and years so don\u2019t rush it and take your time, building your town and getting everything the way you want it. This game is absolutely visually stunning Running at a gorgeous 1080p 30fps. That 30fps might seem like a bit of a bummer, but rest assured it stays at 30fps and never dips and still looks very smooth. The best thing about this game is it\u2019s charm. Talking to each character is such an enjoyable experience. Multi playing with friends is smooth with no lag and a good way to trade items. This game is very addicting and you\u2019ll most likely find yourself spending hours into the night. Keep in mind that the game will keep posing new quests and challenges weeks down the line. But a lot of this game is customisation and making your town look the way you want. I love this game so much, and if you are in the slightest bit interested, give it a try. I didn\u2019t think this sort of game was for me either, but that is because it\u2019s not enjoyable to watch someone else play the game but having your own journey is where the charm lies.","Players giving this game a zero and calling themselves Animal Crossing fans are a complete joke....even without the features they are all crying like babies about... it's still a solid 8..you guys should be ashamed of yourselves","Muy divertido , me encanta y si meten alguna actualizaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 un autentico juegazo.","was this review bombed? yeah it has it's flaws, but it's not a 0 out of 10. yall are crazy","I am shocked this game has 5 user score. I don't understand the reason. This game is the ideal sandbox life simulator. I haven't played an Animal Crossing game before but this one got me really into it. The idea of turning a deserted island into a fully equipped with everything town, just makes it even more interesting. And of course, there are TONS of things to do. There are some small things that are annoying though, like time consuming animations each time you do something etc but you get used to it. I fully recommend it, especially for fans of this genre.","Low rating this game I am actually thoroughly enjoying because once again, Nintendo is becoming increasingly greedy. I was upset when they flushed free Online play down the toilet even though they clearly can afford to leave it free. Now I'm hearing how Nintendo is ripping off its consumers with the new Animal Crossing game by basically eliminating any multiplayer functionality and essential forcing households with more than one player to buy a second Switch to enjoy all of the features of the game. I have fond memories 12 years ago of me, my sister, and even my mom (who pretty much never plays video games) playing the previous console based game, City Folk. I grieve for kids who are the age I was at this time who will not have those same memories of their entire family enjoying the game. Nintendo is becoming increasingly less family friendly and more greedy. Shame, Nintendo. Absolute shame. One of these days, Nintendo's greed will cost it it's fanbase: and that will be an unfortunate day if they do not improve their relationship with their consumers. This is completely unacceptable.","Que gran juego, llevo horas de vicio. es muy bueno se puede hacer de todo. nada mejor para pasar la pandemia","This game is saving the sanity of the human race. Brilliantly executed. Lol review bombers.","honestly don't listen to the bad reviews this game is amazing and if you can Get IT, its amazing and fixes so much About Animal Crossing","This game is made of crack, I enjoy long 100 hour JRPGs, and I've spent more time on this game in two months than I did half a year last year playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Dragon Quest XI combined. I really enjoy the freedom afforded to us in designing our islands, I terraformed mine pretty hard and ended up with a pretty sweet island. Visitors love it! The community at large is pretty sweet, so my online multiplayer experience has been pretty good so far, but it seems that you shouldn't share accounts on a same switch, which is definitely a glaring weakness. Overall I highly recommend. It's been likened to the Lego Duplo version of Minecraft, which I can't deny.","\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 3DS, \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435, \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0435.\r\u041b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435\r\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0443.","\u041c\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 Animal Crossing \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 New Leaf, \u043d\u0430 Nintendo 3DS, \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0430\u044e. \u0418 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0436\u0435, New Horizons \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u0414\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441 \u043d\u0443\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432.\u041d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0440 (\u0432 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430). \u0412 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b. \u042f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b. \u041d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0438\u0437 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0432. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c 9/10, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0430 6,2 (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430), \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443.","Money grubbing one island per switch feature demonstrates that the Nintendo of today is no different than the EAs of the world. Nintendo would rather give themselves the chance to move more Switch units than give their fans a proper game they can enjoy with their families during this time of panic and uncertainty. Do better Nintendo.","Awesome graphics and gameplay. The villagers are really cute! A gem! I really enjoy the series!","This is a good game but i cant play it because I have to wait for my GF who is casual to unlock things. This game is amazing for anyone who is playing SOLO i repeat playing SOLO. Do not get this if you share a console as only ONE person can play the FULL game.  I hope so much that Nintendo retracts this choice as it is not going to convince me to buy another console. The game is really good but not worth spending 200-300 more dollars just to be able to have 2 people play with FULL ACCESS. Many people already know that the first account on the switch to start the game is the \"Resident Representative\" of the Island and they are the only person who can advance the story, buildings, and citizens of the town. Any player/account who starts the game of the switch after that first player can only gather resources and upgrade there own house and characters appearance and size and can only get blueprints and items that the FIRST PLAYER has unlocked first. This was super disappointing to find out and I really hope they change this.","Get multiple islands per switch and I will change this review score to a 10","The best Animal Crossing game to date. It's even more immersive than the previous ones, and the multiplayer is well done. I can't put it down and neither can my friends.","This game is so calming and fun. People have been tanking the score because you can only have one island but tanking a score because of one little thing is petty. I greatly enjoyed the game and have no trouble sharing, since that's how the game is meant to be played.","Muy entretenido. Es verdad que tiene carencias, pero no son nada comparado a todo lo positivo.  Juego con mi esposa y nos divertimos por horas diariamente, y eso que es iniciando no me imagino en un par de semanas que tengamos todo desbloqueado","An amazing game from the graphics to the gameplay. Found myself addicted within a day.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is definitely the best in the series.  It takes everything up a notch.  The characters are as lovable as in Population Growing again, and the world is as huge as well.  Building the world how you want from New Leaf is completely ramped up, and the world is more full of fish and bugs than ever.  Crafting completely changes the game, allowing the player to enjoy the game at night or early morning, even though shops are closed.  This is truly a triumphant return for Animal Crossing, and the game will be even better when the dlc arrives.  If you enjoyed any Animal Crossing game, you'll love this one, and if you've never given Animal Crossing a shot, now's certainly the time.  Those new to Animal Crossing will love the game, and those who have played an AC game, or fans since the original (like me) will absolutely adore it.  - kkslider","Animal Crossing New Horizons, is by far the best game in the series. The game starts off differently from every other animal crossing.You start in a barren island with 2 other villagers and a very bare bones shop. You also can\u2019t reach the majority of the island yet. As you progress you gain new tools that help collect bugs, fish, and building supplies. You\u2019ll eventually see more shops move in as you also gain new tools like the pole vault and ladder to explore the rest of the island. It\u2019s extremely fun to see the island develop into a full on town. While the game does take days to get new things, you can easily skip that process by using time travel (I personally don\u2019t). My main complaint is the multiplayer. For at least where I am now, there\u2019s not much to do besides visit your friends island and not much more. But in end I do really enjoy my time playing the game and think it\u2019s an easy 10/10 game.","This game is a heap if fun for all animal crossing veterans and new players! The new crafting feature is really intuitive and it dowant feel like some crafting is put of reach like in other games. The game is rewarding and always gives you something to work on. I'm really glad I picked it up.","Es un juego fant\u00e1stico donde puedes hacer un mont\u00f3n de cosas s\u00faper interesantes","Polished and fun! Some features that other animal crossings start with are now behind a few long steps (Town Hall), but the new landscaping and online are amazing fun!","We love it! I would rate it 11.  Super customizable, fun and challenging, gender expansive, visit friends and share messages and items. And it is only getting better as we play.","THIS GAME GREAT! I've spent so much ours in this game and I am not going to stop there!","I am thoroughly disappointed at many different things about this game. Everything from only having one island per switch to the overarching theme of nintendo lately, which is to over monetize every single IP that they have.","Really love this game so far, think it's a very modern take on a game that could of aged badly, really easy to pick up and play and I look forward to what or who will show up the next day. looking forward to the future content and a living cycle of DLC.","I couldn't wait to play this game! I've been playing animal crossing since it first came out for the GameCube. That being said I'm really impressed with what this new game brings to the table. I absolutely love the single-player gameplay with New Horizon. It's just as relaxing as all of the previous games and it adds so much more to do. I also enjoyed inviting a close friend of mine to visit my island. It was very easy to do and we both enjoyed our time.  I would say the crappy part about it was having to type to each other to communicate. That was a pain to do but nevertheless we still enjoyed visiting each other. I have yet to try to play with family (We do have two switch systems, however, my son is too young to know how to play and my husband cares more for Smash bros than anything else lol), however, despite it not personally affecting me there should have still been a much better way this could have been implemented for those it does have an effect on. It's not fair that they have to go through so much (even as far as buying another system) just to play with one another when they shouldn't have to. If I remember correctly, in the first animal crossing game you could all live in the same location, so why make it different now? I will however still be fair with my rating. I don't think the game deserves a 0 because of that as it brings a lot to the table, but I cannot give it a 10 when multiplayer is not up to par.","Amazing game, best in the series so far! Multiplayer is best enjoyed when everyone has their own Switch and own copy of the game. I look forward to playing this one for years to come like I did with the first one on GameCube.","I love this game and i am very excited to have it. It makes you play it like you should, keeps you having to come back with a little bit every day. I personally do not mind only having one island, that is how the game was when the original came out. I love that i can organise my island and the crafting is interesting. Its the same as the old but made in a new refreshing way.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is a refreshing entry in the series by combining the best aspects of previous games and polishing them. As a whole New Horizons most resembles the GameCube entry from the early 2000s. With this resemblence comes a few features being cut but in exchange many have been added mostly in the way of customization from the freedom to place whatever you want on the island to the ability to change your characters physical appearance when a mirror is present. Overall NH is a fantastic entry.","The one island thing is indefensible, even if they told us up front. How many families have more than one child that would want to run their own island without their siblings interfering?\r But that isn't why I gave this a zero. The big reason to me is the absolutely clunky and slow menu controls, and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you're trying to enjoy the game.\r I get that it's supposed to be \"slow\" and \"charming\", but I think AC fans are too quick to defend the game's charm that they think any criticism on the game is unfounded. If AC fans actually told the devs things that were not great, the series might have progressed since it was created.\r This series was created on the GC when a lot of devs were still figuring out the do's and dont's of game development. Things like \"If you're going to make a game about crafting and customization, DON'T make the menu interface INSANELY SLOW, DON'T preface that menu with SLOW, crawling text that asks if you want to craft, DON'T only let us craft one item at a time, then DON'T make a five second craft and \"tadaa!\" animation that can be sped up by like, 5%, by jamming on the buttons, and then DON'T make us have to answer a slow, crawling question about going back into the menu, and doing it all over again. If I want to make a couple darkwood chairs, I have to slowly make each of them one at a (slow) time, then exit that menu and slowly enter the customization menu, and proceed to slowly customize them all, also one at a time.\r If I want to figure out how much items sell for, I have to SLOWLY sell each different item alone, because there is no other way to know (also, you have to deal with slow crawling intro text, and you get booted out of the whole thing to start over each time). You know what they could have done? 1) Made it quicker. 2) Made the shops show the sell price as you hover over them, 3) add the pricing somewhere in all that empty space on the critterpedia entries. So many options to have not done it it annoyingly, but they figured out how to avoid all of them.\r Don't tell me this is the \"charm\" of the game. The speed was charming back when there was barely anything to do in the game. For some asinine reason, they thought that clunky charm is equal no matter how it's utilized. But in a game that is now all about crafting and customizing at a scale it's never done before, SOMEONE on their team should have said \"uhh, this actually really sucks when all you're trying to do is build and customize a couple chairs and a table. Maybe we should change the crafting menu, at least.\" I'm hoping that at some point, the shop \"evolves\" and they're like \"haha, look at all these new features! Aren't you happy that it isn't so annoying anymore?\", but even if they did that, I'd still be upset that they chose to screw with us instead of just MAKING IT GOOD.\r It sucks, because the large majority of the game is good - but it's like someone gave you a delicious ice cream, but then slapped you in the back of your head every time you try to enjoy it.","I have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time and the newest entry is a worthy add on the the on going franchise. The new mechanics that were added were some that fans like myself have been asking for for a long time. And now that they have been added I could only dream of the things that could come in the future. The only complaint I have is the slow start, but that's fine. I don't mind taking my time with a game.","I think this might just be one of the best Animal Crossings yet. I know there is a lot of flack for the one island thing but I don't think that learning how to share and not be a jerk is a bad thing, Ultimately there is a lot to do and collect and the multiplayer functions are neat. I just wish you could go to random islands with friends. it would make the grinding a lot more fun, also the length of the in game chat message sometimes seems too short.","We spent $300 on a switch for the family. $50 for this game. However unlike every other game we own on the system (Breath of the Wild, Fire Emblem, Ring Fit, Astral Chain) only 1 player in our family can get the full experience in Animal Crossing. Everyone else get's a much more butchered experience and they have less ability to effect their own game world. This kind of system does not exist in the other games we have nor is it something you see in games on other systems. Nintendo this is absolutely ridiculous that if other members of our family want the full Animal Crossing New Horizons experience they need to buy a brand new Switch system for themselves. Please fix this issue! Until Nintendo fixes this with a patch I would recommend anyone who shares their Switch system to NOT buy this game.","I would love this game if it weren't for the multiplayer. Forcing two players to be on split screen is bad enough, but add in the fact that each Switch system can only have ONE island and you get a giant steaming pile of sh*t. This game could have been amazing but those things completely ruin everything it could have been. I won't be buying another AC title, if there ever is one. Hope they let the series die here instead of running it into the ground further.","The game is the BEST animal crossing so far, all the new features, such as crafting and choosing where do the villagers live allows you tu personalize your entire island. The felling of proud that watching the birth of your town that this game gives you has no comparison.\rIt's true that much of the features are limited to the first player, but it's the same situation that was in New Leaf, so i see it as a minor con.","Es una mierda , una isla por consola joder,Es una mierda , una isla por consola joder,","Multilayer connection takes a super long time, but it's fun and has a lot to do and that can be done. Custom patterns are intense.","If you've played Animal Crossing before then you know what to expect.  That's my only complaint.  If you've never played the series though, you NEED this game in your life!  I do love crossing animals though, so I'll continue to throw bells at Nintendo as long as they make this series (Who am I kidding?  I'll throw money at Nintendo as long as they're Nintendo!).","Just so polished, the soundscapes are as breathtaking as the visuals. The fish, the sky, and the local flora have all gotten massive updates to make the jump to HD impressive. The only qualm I have is with the multiplayer connection, and hopefully that will be patched in a future update","Everything I've ever wanted for animal crossing, started playing city folk back on the Wii. It is a dream to play, exactly what it is meant to be. 10/10","Giving this a 0 because it's totally unplayable. My wife started her island and when I went to play I got 0 introduction, tossed onto her island with no direction, and since she collected all the resources there was nothing there.I'll never buy another animal Crossing game again, or any game that has this \"one world per switch\" feature. Its a disgusting push to sell more consoles. You already got my money nintendo, let me enjoy what I paid for.","My wife and my son can\u2019t enjoy the game because I played first and the game doesn\u2019t allow separate games. Now I\u2019m the **** Thanks, Nintendo!","The first person to play the game becomes the mayor, and anyone else in your house who plays it is completely gimped as far as what they can do in the game. And you cant play on separate islands either unless you buy a second Nintendo Switch. So I play with both my kids and It just makes it really frustrating.Also, breakable tools and a crafting system, really?? Animal Crossing was such a great game before they tried to turn in into Minecraft","For all of the people who are upset about there being one island per switch, this has actually always the way animal crossing has been. It saddens me to see such a masterpiece be downrated all the way to zero just because new players don't understand the animal crossing franchise , or did no research before buying. Nintendo explained it would be one island per person a long time ago before release. With that out of the way, let me review the game as an experienced animal crossing player.. New Horizons","I'm not the kind of user to go down and rate-bomb titles, but this time I'm being honest, rating this game as a SECOND PLAYER ON CONSOLE. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one thinking that, given the second player experience is reduced, no effort was put into giving him any reason to keep playing.\rNothing worth doing except grinding instead of 1st player in order to get him to unlock stuff. You are literally on a master-slave kind of relation.\rHonestly, I've paid a full game, I've been paying 2 separate Nintendo Online subscription and that's not what I expected from ANY game.\rEmbarrassing to say the least.","So you get this game during the 2020 pandemic. You are most stuck inside your house. And even under those circumstances, where every distraction is welcome, the game is still immensely enjoyable. My personal recommendation is to play the game whatever way you want it. Don't get hung up on how other people are playing it. Just sit down, play it, do whatever you want and is possible. You want to turn it into work by working away at paying those house loans off? Go ahead! You want to just play a little bit each day and hang out with the villagers? Nobody is telling you not to! Want to make a little tropical paradise on the island? Enjoy yourself!","As a long time Animal Crossing player I wholeheartedly recommend this new title to fans of AC, it has all the upgrades I've been hoping for! The opening is a bit slow but the pacing picks up steadily. My roommates and I have been loving this game! It's worth noting we're all adults with our own consoles though. To new time player's wondering if this game is for them: my best advice is check out some gameplay video on YouTube, what you see is what you get. Put succinctly Animal Crossing is a charming city simulation game, it doesn't have a grand narrative.  Lastly, I don't understand why people are tearing down New Horizons for the island limit, Animal Crossing has always had this limit. It's not surprising. The appeal of multiplayer has always been playing together across multiple consoles, each player with their own screen and full range of controls, Nintendo released the Switch Lite in anticipation of this. The Switch is meant to be the successor of Nintendo's home and handheld consoles, it has the assets of both, tv play and on-the-go functionality. Animal Crossing New Horizons doesn't need to be docked to get the most out of the game, a Switch Lite is perfect for people who want to play this game without committing to a full ticket Switch.","same sh*t as always... nintendo style\r How is possible to sell the SAME videogame hundreds and hundreds of times and have all nintendo fanboys in your hand?\r also have 1 only island PER CONSOLE? omg","What a phenomenal game. The graphics are gorgeous, the characters are lovely, the scenery is charming and all around, it's a perfect game. It calms you down, lets you take a breather from the hellish world that is where we are currently, and envelops you in a beautiful, serene paradise where you have nothing to do and nowhere to go, except for making a few friends and maybe making some money along the way. Please purchase this game, it's so, so worth it.","Don't listen to the whiners. great game. it is exactly what it should be.  yes it's different. yes you are very bottle necked if you want two or more people getting the full game experience without buying multiple copies. to all you people who want free games because they owe us shut up. stop buying  games if you just whine every time. they limited us to one island to stop you all from cheating to get everything like every other game","Its hard to look at the game play for this one. If its fun, charming addictive, interesting or any other characteristic for a good is spoiled by the fact only one person can play a real game per Switch and copy of the game you own. Only one players can progress or make choices. I'm sure it was posted hidden on a description of the game somewhere but i didn't know it until I already bought the game. No other game i have ever owned has such a terrible \"feature\" I dont understand why they would put that in and its hard to get over.\r Do not buy this game if you plan for it to be shared with people in your household. Everything else in the game doesn't really matter how good it is if you only 50% or less of the people you planned to let play it can not.","This  game is great but the fact that it limits the full experience to one person is terrible. Please Nintendo fix your game.","This is a review from the point of view of a second player: the game sucks.","This game is absolutely charming! At first, I was saddened that my wife and I couldn't have our own island, but then I realized Animal Crossing has never set itself up this way- since the original! Then I realized it would be a wonderful challenge to develop this island together. Each day we compare the things that we've done, and help each other make wonderful little homes and neighbors on our \"Muffintown.\"This has been a wonderfully therapeutic relationship builder for the two of us. Thanks Nintendo!","Dont play if you want to have your own island as opposed to sharing an island with someone with the same console. Unbelievably stupid business decision. Unless people are stupid enough to buy another console. Wish I could return it but im the idiot who bought it digitally thru eshop","While yes, being limited to one island per switch is pretty stupid, it is certainly not enough to make it a 0/10 game. New horizons is the best game in the series in my opinion. Its looks gorgeous, it's fun and interactive, so relaxing and very polished. If you just want a layer back and chill experience, I highly recommend this game.","This game is great. Everyone complaining about the multiplayer can\u2019t read. The information has been there. Do a little research before you spend $60 on a game.","Is incredible! I exceed my expectations.And I'm not concerned that it's only one island per console.The game has always been like this forever.","As much as I love the feel of the game (being new to the Animal Crossing games in general), I can't rate this game higher than 0 due to the terrible decisions around multiplayer households playing together.I bought this game primarily for myself, whilst my boyfriend could play less when he wanted. Unfortunately due to timings he played first. Little did I know this sealed the deal for me poor game experience. The first player has access to The main story line and decision making roles. Any extra player is a glorified NPC who contributes nothing!!! As i payed for the game i expect to be able to get the same game experience, it is shocking decision by jintendo to limit people in this way and try and fve thmee to buy another switch. BEWARE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AS IT IS BOUND TO CAUSE ARGUMENTS.","Bought this for myself and my wife to play, but in Nintendo's infinite wisdom they have decided that only one of us will ever get to enjoy the full experience, locking out anyone but the first player from making critical game decisions. At least my wife gets to play properly I've already had to quit.","It's a lovely game that honors the series and improves on many things, but it is completely crippled by dishonest marketing of its multiplayer and local co-op. Only the first player to start the game will have a full experience of Animal Crossing. Any other players will live in a perpetually unfulfilling world. Tasks, villagers, tools, experience, etc will never be fully attainable as a second player. With a simple software update, this game could go from a broken co-op experience to being a beautiful, shared adventure in paradise. Please fix this Nintendo.","Even if you buy two seperate copies and such, you can only have one island PER SWITCH. ruined the experience up to the point that i\u2019m not gonna bother playing. Yeah its typical for AC but it\u2019s 2020, not 2012.","It's bogus. I can't have my own island and visit others on the console? I would get my credit back if I didn't buy a digital copy. Honestly won't play it now.","SCAM! Only one person can REALLY play per game. Second users have only limited access to the game. You basically need to buy two Nintendo switches and two copies of the game to play the game for two people - disgusting.","Alls i want is my own island it makes no sense to lock it to 1 island per console fix it","Game is really bad. All these crazy high scores from reviewers are straight up criminal. Practically always have long double confirmation with every transaction,  no goals, crazy checklistsIt's amidst like a much much worse version of minecraft","It's Animal Crossing! 'Nuff said! And to all the butt hurt players let me point out something;Locking each switch to one island makes sense. It's the exact same as when it came out on EVERY OTHER SYSTEM. When it came out on GameCube, the Memory card could only hold one town. If you wanted another you had to buy another memory card. The DS and 3DS Games only had enough storage for one Town. The Wii only only had one town per Wii. Most of you idiots must not be dedicated fans, otherwise you would know that. Think, or at least learn about the product,, before you wrongfully try to bash it Animal Crossing has been a favorite pastime of mine for 19 years and still going!","The decision to limit one island per switch is an embarrassingly horrible marketing decision to get people to buy another nentendo switch. Meaning that each save file of this game costs about three hundred and sixty dollars. I wonder why nentendo would do that? O yeah, money.\r Not only that, but second player on couch co-op is bafflingly aweful. all items picked up by the second player are sent to a box instead of the inventory for no conceivable reason.","this is a game that I was looking forward to for months, and while the game itself is beautiful, there is one thing I can't ignore. I hate that I have to share an island with my family. It really pulls away from the enjoyment of the game. I don't get the same sense of accomplishment when the museum fills up. I can't control the look and feel of my island. everything is way too cramped. I just wish the game would have given me the choice of sharing or not. the sad thing is, I wanted to like this game, but I'm not having fun sharing.\rIf you're the only one on your island, great, you'll have lots of fun. If not it stinks. and this isn't even a game limitation, it's a switch limitation. that makes it so much worse.\rthe only way you can enjoy this game is if you're the only one on your island.","So my wife never played Animal Crossing, I haven't played since the Gamecube version, I thought this would be great to play together.Iearn that we both have to be on the same island despite having different accounts. I'm a little disappointed since we can't work on our own thing, but okay at least we'll be able to work together cooperatively right?No. As the second player, I can't help contribute to quests. I couldn't help get bugs/fish to Nook, I couldn't help get materials to help build the shop, I can't help set up the new houses, I can't help build bridges, I can't help contribute anything to the game's story. I'm basically locked in progression behind her; I had to wait for her to get the axe before I could. I have to wait until she's able to build the shop until I can use it. Some of the little activities you can do for points are locked by story progression, so I'm stuck doing the same things over and over with no variety until she progresses the game. And that's so unbelievably frustrating to me since we can't have our own islands. I'm not even talking about simultaneous co-op. This is me playing as a second account.What is even the reason behind limiting the second player? This does nothing but break the experience for me, and now my wife feels bad. It's a terrible design decision and I really hope it gets reversed at some point because it's absolute nonsense. There's absolutely no reason why a second profile shouldn't be able to get the same experience as the first. Either give me the little brother mode with limitations but offer me the option to work on my own island with full control, or if there's only 1 island let me help work on our island together without these dumb limitations. I'm just floored at how bad this is.","Absolutely disappointed with this game. The gameplay is what you expect from the great Animal Crossing titles, however the multiplayer was heavily mismanaged. First resident is the only island member that can contribute to projects and design the island how they want. Every secondary character is basically submitted to being a resource slave for the first player. The game only allows one island per switch so the resources you gather daily can only be harvested by a single user each day. This severely limits the whole crafting gimmick of this game. I\u2019d be willing to buy a second game to have another island but it doesn\u2019t matter because the island is locked to the switch and not the game... :(","Apparently I need to wait till tomorrow to continue playing unless I just want to fish and gather weeds. Why tie progress to real time? This is a fictional universe and I'm looking to get away from quarantine boredom. I would not have paid money for this game knowing it would be another Farmville. Silly bottlenecks have me playing another game and regretting lost money.","Absolute great, I'm playing nonstop. The game chars are charming, the graphic is cute, this is honestly an awesome game.","Obviously those who score below 8 are bandwagons and pandemic players .\r Nintendo already announced that there is only one island per console before the game was released.\r Next time use your brain before you buy a new game oh and by the way Nintendo doesn't care about your ratings anyway the game was successful.","Game feels too linear for AC and just unfinished. The crafting mechanic feels added just to slow progress.   Daughter cant do anything without my assistance because Nook is closed for 2 days.  Feels like a mobile game youd play 1 hr a day.","Sehr gutes Spiel! Einziges Manko ,dass man blo\u00df eine Insel pro Switch haben kann.","I love the game so far, as I expected its the most worked out game in the franchise, I'll give it a 10, I was going to give it an 8 for online play but noticed that, its not the end of the world by that, like in 3ds wasnt like that already?","Soo good!!!!! Has Animals there is crossing. It's perfect what more could you want!","I have played the game for about 30 hours now and had a lot of fun. I see that a lot of people don't like the wait, but if you say that then why did you buy the game? And there is always the option of time travelling. I had a huge blast with the game so far and it came out at the perfect time for corona.","I made an account here just for the sake of reviewing this game.   Please for the love of god add some way of making two islands per switch.  Even if it mean having to buy multiple games.  I have a large family.  All of my kids, my wife, and myself would all like our own islands.  I already own 2 switch consoles and two copies of the game but that still leaves me 4 short.  It is unreal that in this day in age you console lock something like this.  Maybe if all profiles on one console could at least have the powers of the Island Representative it would work.  Anything other than this terrible excuse for co-op.  That is why it is a 1/10 for me.  Because currently, this game is completely unplayable for 4/6 members of my household.","Boo Nintendo! yet again u do these anti-consumer practices!I dont like this at all!","This game is locked behind the first person who plays the game and so others who start have to wait for that person for progression throughout the island. This game would be so much better if Nintendo let all players contribute equally to the games progression.","I think is a boring Game. And if you have brothers justo 1 can play fine. That is disgusting.","Honteux , je ne vais pas pouvoir y jou\u00e9 !!! Merci Nintendo ! Ma copine a sont \u00eeles mais moi je vais pas pouvoir jouer ! Honteux !!!!!!!! Dernier jeux Nintendo achet\u00e9","Ignore the haters. I bought the game for my partner and she's setting our rate of progress. I'm glad we can share our island and take time to explore it together. All of these tryhards are just butthurt because they can't get what they want immediately. Nintendo made the GOTY.","UPDATE BELOW.\rOk. The game seems fine. But if you are a family, several kids, multiple accounts on ONE switch. JUST DONT BUY IT. Every player but the main player is stuck after 30 minutes. You can't get the ability to create the basic axe. Why ?\r 1st of all, you can only create one island on one switch. Ok, why not ,the most active one should be the mayor. It's so sad but let day they have a reason for this (actually this is just a stupid restriction)\rThen you realize you can't create a basic tool because the menu to do it (a dialog with Tom nook) just doesn't exist for non-main players..... Whaaaat ?\rOk, you think \"ok the main player has to unlock this so others can use it.\" . Ahah. NO! You CANT.\r Either it's a bug (so basic ?) Either it's a \"feature\", a deliberate choice. Then the game is unusable and the marketing strategy is \" like this game ? Buy each kid a switch, each kid a game and shut up\". Errrrrrr\rAmazing.\rDon't buy it. Or prepare for a fight at home.\r Oh ,I almost forgot. The local multiplayer mode: useless, the 2nd player is just a pet following the other, farming for him, more slowly (stupid animation each time you pick up a piece of wood...). No split screen, no interest at all.\r I'll wait a bit to see if a patch comes out soon. Or then I'll throw this piece of nook away.\r'hope it helps\r UPDATE : it seems after 2 or 3 specific actions from the main player, a new key character comes in and all players can finally get all the tools and trigger key improvements even if they're not the main player. Still, one common island or many should be a choice one switch player profile should be able to make","I don't really care about the one island per switch thing, it doesn't affect me. But the simple fact I cannot craft multiple items at once is enough for a five. Spending the better part of about two minutes to craft a decent amount of fishing bait because it is one at a time is insane. For the love of god Nintendo, please allow me to craft all my fishing bait at once.","I had to create an account just to rate this game and hopefully leave a review people would read. This is easily the best entry in the animal crossing series! Incredibly customizable and just breathtaking. The negative reviews touch on pretty much only one singular thing; the lack of multiple islands on a single console. I understand this. It sucks that you cannot have more than one island on a console, however, leaving a zero review because of this factor is not genuine. A ton of people dislike one factor and rate it a zero. It isn\u2019t fair. I urge anyone reading this to look up footage of the game rather than reading these very weird reviews. It\u2019s a fantastic game, just know going into it that there is only one Island per console, which was explained in a Nintendo Direct prior to the release of the game, and covered by many gaming news companies.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is an amazing game and the perfect addition to my Switch library. Don't let the people review bombing this game, the game is amazing.","I loved this game and it was very fun. The only problem was the 1 island per switch restrictions and I would give and 8 but some are giving this game a zero just for one flaw alone.","I've played Nintendo since the NES console days and I can honestly say that this is one of the best games released to date. Do not believe the haters, I'm sure they are all addicted to the game like everyone else and playing it every day but they think its amusing to bring a games score down like the Warcraft fiasco (which deserved a negative rating). Nintendo have always been 10+ years behind everyone else when it comes to online functionality so I did not expect multiplayer to work seamlessly and the fact I cant save to the cloud is annoying because i cant transfer my save files to my switch lite. Other than that just play the game, get lost in it and try to switch off from the coronovirus fears","\u042f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b.\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e Nintendo!\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0436\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438,\u043d\u043e \u044f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0434","I very rarely give a game a 10/10, because there's almost always room for improvement. So that 's why I gave a 9/10. I was waiting for this game since the switch came out, after hearing and reading about the game while it was in development I made the descission to buy it, even with all the criticism out there... I was not dissapointed. It's a shame that there's only one island per switch, but it's another reason to buy a switch for my children so we can visit eachothers islands. It's not a reason to give this game a very bad review, because if the only thing that turns your 0 into a 9 or 10 is the one island per system thing maybe you shouldn't have bought it, because that was a feature everyone knew from the beginning... Do your research before you buy people... Otherwise just enjoy the game as is. I know I am. ;-)","Most reviews here that are low, are review bombs due to the fact that the game locks the Switch to one island per system. As well as the current lack of cloud saving. These are unjust and angry reviews that do not understand what the game is meant to be! Animal Crossing New Horizons is the latest entry in the Animal Crossing series, it is incredible, hosting many improvements, including a new random Island system whereby you can travel to a randomly generated island to gather resources, fish, and catch bugs. Not only this but nook Miles is a new system which allows constant progression for doing anything in the game (paying mortgage, fishing, talking to villagers, etc.). The restriction of one island per system is intended to make the game feel personal. As your island and all its progressive, is only on one system. It's truly the best animal crossing game to date and a must buy.","Unplayable if you happen to be sharing the Switch with a family member who just wanted to try it out and got bored after first day, whereas I played the game for DAYS before realizing that this situation is making it impossible to progress in the game.","I absolutely love Animal Crossing and have played every single game prior to this one. I was super excited to play this one. .... Except now I'm Player 2, and can't do anything in the game. My wife was excited and made her character first, but she's a casual player and I tend to play every day. She doesn't want to restart the island and we're in no position to buy another Switch and another copy of the game, so why limit us like this? I play Animal Crossing for the relaxing experience and am now left feeling frustrated beyond belief. I honestly feel like I'm just an NPC in her game. If Covid-19 hadn't have put us all on lockdown, I'd be returning this game. Please fix this, Nintendo!","I had so much fun for the first few days, until I realised that I can never progress this island solely because of the chance of who went first in my household.  My partner isn't interested in this game and won't progress the story. So unless I restart and erase all my progress, or play two games at once, I'm doomed to a lifetime of fishing and bug catching.  Extremely.disappointing.","As someone who joined into the series well after new leaf initially released, I can say that this game has far exceeded my expectations. The amount of people giving it zeroes is frankly ridiculous. Sure, it has some flaws- local multiplayer is limited, and one island per switch isn't ideal. Still, as someone who's been sharing the game with three younger siblings since day one, it hasn't actually been an issue for me. It's what we did in New Leaf, and it's working well here too. If this kind of game is one you enjoy- something slow paced and peaceful- you wouldn't find a better experience anywhere else.","My brother played the game first so now the game is essentially unplayable for me.","There's absolutely no excuse to not allowing for more than one island per console! It's a lovely game, but Nintendo's monkey paw strikes again.","I looked forward for almost a year to this game and I\u2019m honestly disappointed. There are a couple reasons beside the awful switch-share deal:1) the museum. I can\u2019t get information about the animals/bugs/Dino\u2019s, unless I talk to blathers with one in my hand. It ruins it because I want to know about dinosaurs and how am I supposed to just get another fossil from the exact one?2) the music. I lived the music up until the new center was built up from a tent to the building.the music is loud and I not calm, like I want it to be while I play, and there\u2019s no way to turn it off of even down. 3) villagers requests/missions. They barely give me any, if at all. I miss themOverall, this game let me down. I feel like I wasted my money buying it. Please, if anything fix the music.","The most soothing, relaxing game ever turns to garbage as soon as you try to cooperatively play with friends and family","I NEVER play games, I just have alot of other hobbies. My bf convinced me to buy it together since we could play together. Turns out since im the 2nd player that theres a whole lot of stuff I can't do as a 2nd player which makes it way less exciting to play.I hope they will fix it, because the game overall seems fun and I did put in half of the money! I think thats the case for a lot of people who bought this together.","The good is as most people say: the graphics and audio are amazing, some things are more convenient. I agree with all of it so I'm just going to focus on the bad.\r The bad:\r- There is WAY too little content for a $70 game. Half of the characters seem to have been axed (Brewster, Katrina, the dream suite, Leif, Gracie, the aplacas...). I kept thinking, 'Is this it? Is this all there is to the game?' when I realized that the last character to unlock was KK Slider.\r- Needing the Nintendo Switch Online paid subscription to: 1) online play, 2) use QR codes. This is just really unfair.\r- The increased number of tools. There are way too many tools. I'm of the opinion that a good game has one or two key dynamics and builds around that. But there are so many tools in ACNH that it becomes cumbersome when playing.\r- DIY CRAFTING OF TOOLS. I effing hate this. Every tool breaks, even golden tools. Then what is the benefit of getting a golden tool? In ACNL, each tool upgrade gave a benefit that made sense in the game. The gold bug net has an increased radius so you can catch rare bugs that startle when you get too close, the golden watering can waters more flowers... There isn't even a way to tell if the tool is close to breaking.\r- The constant grinding for materials. Because tools break, half my playtime is spent gathering materials. This has a few problems: 1) distracts from gameplay, 2) materials are almost as important as bells coz you need them to craft a variety of things, 3) at least 5-6 spaces in my inventory are wasted on holding materials, negating the increased inventory size\r- The mileage programme. Like above, it distracts from the game coz in essence you have a bunch of meaningless and repetitive side-quests to do just so you can grind for quite a meager amount of miles (e.g. selling 10 seashells for about 200 miles). Also hate that the island ticket is paid for by mileage\r- I really hate the new island mechanic. There are no tours, which makes it boring. When there is multiplayer, there's nothing to do. The islands also no longer reliably spawn sharks and rare bugs.\r- Very difficult to grind for bells now. In New Leaf, a reliable way of getting money was through the money rock/the ore rock and the island, or the Bell Boom town ordinance (where are the ordinances, by the way?). The money rock gives less money now, there is no ore rock, the island no longer spawns rare stuff. Most items also have inflated prices. Flower seeds used to be 80 bells, now it's 240 bells.\r- Paying bells to send letters. Seriously? Why on earth did someone think this was a good idea? Animal Crossing is about a sense of community that you create in the new island/town you move to. The letter system really gave a sense that you were writing to your villagers and they'd write back and send presents. Also, the villagers don't write back.\r- THE VILLAGERS. They have way blander personalities. They no longer ask you to change their catchphrase, ask you to run silly errands and run up to you and pester you for something in your inventory. Their dialogue options are incredibly repetitive, where each villager seems to repeat the same 2-3 lines. Even the cute little animations are very repetitive.\r- Having only 1 island per console. The local co-op system also is **** [link omitted per rules]\r- Why isn't there an icon on my map for other players who are here?\r- The merchants. Why is Kicks a wandering merchant instead of having an unlockable shop? Why is the furniture selection at T&amp;T so small, and why can it only be upgraded once? Why isn't there the option to VIEW the wallpaper and flooring I want to buy, in the shop itself, before I buy it?\r- Only being able to order 5 things from the catalogue. Why the ****\r TLDR: the game is very beautiful and instagrammable, with some convenient upgrades, but it is mainly incredibly lacking in content, it is repetitive and restrictive, resulting in quite a frustrating gameplay experience. I am still playing because I love decorating and customizing, but it is incredibly unsatisfying.","We bought this game as a flat and have just discovered that you have to share an island and all progression is tied to the main account. Pretty uncool for a console designed to be shared. Hoping that an update is released allowing us all to have our own island so that someone other than the primary player can fully enjoy it","while getting the aesthetic on point and being a gorgeous game, it really lacks things to do that actually stay fun.\r also, mUlTiPlAyEr :^)   welcome back in 2006, nothing is allowed in multiplayer and people still have to join one by one. great advertising with up to 8 players on an island to actually do nothing together!","I wish I knew I couldn't have my own file or I wouldn't have bought this garbage.

Vote with your wallets, boycott this trash, I'm returning mine, you should too.","It's ridiculous that the 2 player can't do anything at all ... try to fix it otherwise I'll make the return","This is my first time playing an Animal Crossing game. I watched some streams and videos of it, and got excited and intrigued enough that I wanted to try it out. I let my husband start it out first while I did some other things, only to realize that there is only one island allowed per Switch console. I could deal with that- we could have fun organizing an island together- but I can't progress the game or make any decisions about building on the island. It defeats the purpose of why I wanted the game to begin with. I'd even consider buying another copy of the game if I could get my own island, but that's not an option either.\r I'm really disappointed, and I guess I'm just not going to play it until my husband gets tired of it. I don't think I'll buy another Animal Crossing game at this point.","Local multiplayer is just a slap in the face. One island per switch is a sinful money grab on Nintendo\u2019s part. Do not get this game if you intend to share it with other members of your household!","My girlfriend and I are currently arguing over who's going to be responsible for ruining the other's experience by being the primary residence who slows down the other person's play. Dumbest multiplayer setup ever and I wish I'd known about it before I started as primary because now I want to reset the whole thing","Waste of money and such a scam from Nintendo.  As the 2nd player sharing an island, I\u2019m given the leftovers from the main player. The more I play the less time I spend on in. All I can do is catch bugs, fish and buy stuff for my character. Capitalists pigs who just want people to buy more switch consoles instead of actually caring about their customers","I was really looking forward to this game, however after I did the intro and gave the switch to my boyfriend to play, we found out that it is one island, and that island's resources (so since I had gone through the efforts of doing everything before switching off he had nothing to do) shared per switch. Made the game play really ineffective and if I could return it I would. I don't enjoy the game now as it is more of a \"who gets to play today\" rather than a fun thing we get to do.","Me parece muy fuerte que sea el juego Asin una isla por consola. Eso es una manera de abusar, en una casa como en mi caso que somos dos que jugamos a la Nintendo no podemos tener nuestra propia isla que tengamos que volver a comprar otra consola.Que manera de cargarte un juego que todo el mundo esperaba de esta forma  yo espero que esto se solucione y vuelva a meter una actualizaci\u00f3n arreglando est\u00e1 mierda. Porque si no es asin Nintendo perder\u00e1 gente. Muchas familias no tienen dinero para estar comprando Nintendo sin m\u00e1s  y este juego abuse de esta forma","Only one person in a household can effectively play the game. Ridiculous. We bought this game for our kids to be able to play with their friends online, but it's a non-starter with two kids in the household.","Whats the point of a family type game if you cant have your own islands. Cant even play the game properly because my brother started first. I wanted to play on my own user account but couldnt because part of the game was already there. I did not get to experience the beggining parts of the game and it is extremely frustrating i cant make my own progress without changing my brothers progress.","Nintendo's most agregious cash grab and violation of consumer trust to date.  For each player you need a separate game AND SWITCH console, otherwise the non primary resident (ie: literally second class citizens) are unable to participate in most of the content.You imagine I would still give the game some points for the game play the primary citizen can participate in, however the game was mainly purchased for the family, meaning those the game was intended for are unable to participate in any meaningful way, so..0 points Nintendo.. wow, how the mighty have fallen, and all in the name of bleeding gamers dry.","Non island representatives are people too, please fix it Nintendo. Incredibly lazy.","I bought this game to play with my GF, but as I started first the game, she can't advance in the history, is really annoying and I had no clue about this before start","We literally only bought a switch so we could play animal crossing. Now it turns out we just wasted 400 dollars to be screwed over yet again by Nintendo, a game company who solely thrives on ruining the experience of its users and completely controlling everything they can get there hands on. The fact that you can only have one island per console is absolutely ridiculous. I even called support to see if they were going to fix this issue and I was told to just buy another switch since the main issue with the game isn\u2019t going to be resolved. Thanks Nintendo for ruining another game, yet again. 0 stars.","This game is very fun almost to the point of being addicting. You might be confused by the 0 rating I am giving this, but it is only for one simple reason, which is that you are limited to one island per device. It\u2019s actually ridiculous that any account added after the original one is forced to be on the same island and follow behind the first player in the story. I mean, how difficult is it to just make separate saves for different accounts? I don\u2019t want to have to miss out on the entirety of the main story having to follow behind the main player. Now each player has to compete for resources, land area, everything. The multiplayer option is god awful as well. One player, being the \u2018leader\u2019 can play the game normally while the other player is completely helpless. Having a simple fix of a split screen option would fix this so easily. Like please Nintendo, it really doesn\u2019t seem like that hard of an update to fix the atrocious single island and multiplayer design you came up with. I mean whose idea was this anyway? It\u2019s simply the worst multi player system I have seen in literally any game. Every other game on the Switch allows you to have multiple game saves, but this one just sucks the fun out of the whole game just because of this design! Please please please please please please fix your horrific  system and allow for multiple game saves (multiple islands) and fix the garbage multiplayer system to make it a split screen, or just remove the feature all together. It really doesn\u2019t seem like that hard of a fix that would benefit the thousands of other players who are complaining about the same issues. Again, the game is really fun, but all that fun goes out the door because of these simple little designs.","This should be advertised as a single- player game. Multiplayer is pointless. You can open your emote options as the second player but not your tool options? Nintendo what were you thinking?? I wanted to play this with my wife but we have to just take turns because it's no fun to be the second player. You just follow the leader around... I am extremely disappointed with the ant antiquated feel of the multiplayer system and even the online system. I why can't I be in multiplayer mode and have my wife and I both go visit another person? It's 2020 and if Nintendo wants to charge me for online they need to give me features that are worth paying for. I love the game, but have to review it poorly because of the crap job they did with the multiplayer. Seems to me that they wanted everyone to go out and buy more switches and extra animal crossing games in order to truly play multiplayer. Shame on you Nintendo!","Wow what a total complete scam. I am beyond angry. I spent days playing this game so confused why our island wasn\u2019t advancing. Then my boyfriend, who created his character before mine, signs on after days of not playing and gets all the opportunities to progress the island along with free diy recipes. Nintendo was NOT upfront about this one true player per game console. I feel scammed out of my time and money. Nintendo needs to fix this.","Animal Crossing be like:One to rule them all, with up to 7 slaves who can't progress on their own!","Was super excited to play this game, but there is only ONE save file per switch. For a console designed for families this sucks, you can have up to 8 characters for one island but only ONE island and unless you're the mayor you don't get to make meaningful decisions and if one person collects all of the resources for the day, you'll have to wait until tomorrow to get your own.\r I'm super disappointed in Nintendo for such a massive flaw in what would've been a great game. Was bought for the family, but can't be used for the family. Get it if you are the only person planning on playing, otherwise don't.","Such a shame. Thanks for tethering progression and such to one person. Maybe there'll be a patch but I wont be holding my breath.","Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this game is. It  was hyped to oblivion, and I bought it at it's full, ludicrous $60 price tag, and the game is nothing. You gather and you sell so you can place and gather. That's it. That's literally the entire game summarized in one sentence. This is a $30 game at best. I'm so unfathomably disappointed, I thought this was going to be an amazing experience, and it's nothing. Don't get me started on the multiplayer, easily the most antiquated thing I've seen in any modern game, or the fact that you can only have one island. Waste of time and money completely.","I don\u2019t expect there to be different islands per player but the fact that essentially one character gets the story line while the others do nothing is horrible! What a waste of money for everyone to not be able to truly enjoy the game. Animal crossing should remove the resident representative role completely or AT LEAST make it transferable. This needs to be patched quickly or I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying another animal crossing game. It\u2019s not as family friendly as it promotes itself to be","Love most of the mechanics in the game and I love seeing the community for this game grow but I have one major problem. You can\u2019t have separate islands per switch. Ruins the experience for me and the other people in the house since they can\u2019t progress without me playing.","Only one island per Switch across all accounts. Instant 0 score. No brainer.","Doesn't deserve 5.4. Why are people rating it 0 for one problem? bruh bruh bruh","I haven\u2019t even bought the game and I was about to but I heard there is one island per CONSOLE. Cmon Nintendo????!!!! There are many families that can not afford multiple switches for their kids. There are couples who share switches and now you are taking away the ability to have multiple islands on a single console. I get it if you don\u2019t want to have multiple islands on ONE ACCOUNT but having one island per account just makes more sense. Don\u2019t be greedy guys... you are the company that brings kids together and you are taking away that experience. Do you know how many parents will have to disappoint their kids that they all cannot play the game? People aren\u2019t  rich....... please change this. I just want to understand why Nintendo would want to do this. Is there cheating involved in multiple accounts on a switch? If there is then so what??? People skip days to get bells in the game! To some people that is cheating but you won\u2019t take that away!!! ( I don\u2019t think it really is cheating) Let multiple people play the game on one system. It just makes sense.....please change this quick so more people can buy the game. It was never marketed like this!!!!","Animal Crossing New Horizons is the greatest game in the series. First off, having one island per switch isn\u2019t too big of a deal. If you feel that this is a major problem. You are sorely mistaken. This game has so many improvements that make it impossible for me to go back to an older version. The biggest of the improvements are as follows: Terraforming, full control over placement of buildings, character customization, local play, even more custom designs and placement of said designs. First, Terraforming gives so much freedom to make your island really yours. And placing the buildings wherever you please just adds to this freedom. Character customization makes your character really feel like you, and allows a whole lot of expression. Local play is new to the series and is decent. Probably the worst new component to the game just because of how it is implemented. And finally custom designs. Custom designs makes it really easy for anyone to create amazing looking clothing and pictures. And you can place them anywhere. Overall, an amazing game. And the pros out weigh the cons by an exponential amount. Really, you should buy this game.","Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can\u2019t contribute and can only really gather resources. I hope Nintendo fixes this.","The entire point of the game is to create a community on one shared island.... And you can NEVER do that because only the first player created in the game can actually be a part of it. Even if you play 1 player at a time. I can't help my girlfriend, because only her can make the story go on. It's just like I'm living here as a weird hermit who doesn't want to be a part of the community. Huge disappointment!\rI recommend you don't buy this game unless you want to play it solo and not with your family on the same Switch.\rThis being said, the game suffers many other inconviniences even when you play solo :\rLack of mass craft or mass buy (you have to craft things one by one. Hello clams. I hate you!), for example...","There are 4 of us.Second citizens how very strict limitation in terms of gameplay (can't donate bug, don't participate in island big decisions...).\rI can't even create my own island... This limitation is not disclosed beforehand, and that is the worst part. I play several hours before realizing it, now I have only the following choices:\r- Stay second class citizen\r- wait for a patch\r- bug another swith + game...\rAll suck...\rI don't recommend this game for a household. Or make sure to select the right person as main citizen.","The game doesn\u2019t deserve a zero, however, there is a MAJOR flaw with the way multiplayer is handled. I don\u2019t speak for everyone but Nintendo must see that the majority of us have the same complaint. Why must we resort to purchasing a separate Nintendo switch or switch lite just to have an individual untainted island to experience on our own.Yes, the game is based around playing with friends but it can cause more harm than good when no one gets to do what they want on the game, everyone keeps getting popped to the leader while they are running their own errands, and all of the resources are hogged by the early bird. This is completely absurd and needs to be fixed. I can\u2019t imagine that it is too hard to allow individual save files of this game.... come on Nintendo.","Watched my sister play this all week while working from home only to find out I can\u2019t enjoy the game anywhere near as much as she is. Main reasons being that I can\u2019t have my own island, make any major infrastructure decisions, or even get the same special missions just because we both use the same switch. This was a terrible idea masked as being a \u201cfeature\u201d.","Would be 10. If I was the only one in my home that wanted to play it would be. But the single save file blows major ass.","Fabulous game, but the blatant attempt to get people to buy more consoles with the one island per system is disturbing, especially when the switch is all about how \"shareable\" and \"multiplayer\" it is.  When you take time to think about reasons why it could ONLY be this way (1 island per), there's none besides to boost sales.  There's no way they don't have the capability to make it more than one island.  I'm just glad i haven't heard an excuse like \"It's to encourage family bonding\" or something.  They purposefully downgraded this game.","Give us multiple islands per switch I want to play the game too second player just feels like a meaningless grind. Very unhappy with this game.","The game only allows one island per console, not account, and thus I have to play as a glorified npc on my partner's island. Not cool Nintendo.","Wonderful game, except that same-console multiplayer is really broken. I wanted to build an island together with my wife, but only the first player can meaningfully contribute to and progress through the island development. The second player doesn't get the storyline recipes, quests, or really anything to do on their own regarding the growth of the island. Very disappointing.","Game is decent but you can only have one island per console which limits others that wanna play on another account.","Animal crossing wild world is probably the game I've put the most hours into of all games. I was definitely thrilled for this game, however it's really disappointing that not all players get to have the full experience. Hoping Nintendo patches this, or at the very least, doesn't do this again for the next AC game. This was a huge disappointment that ruins what had the potential to be a great family game.","Inconsiderate game design for families while specially being designed on a console for families. This game is nearly unplayable as a second player. I share my game with my brother who rarely plays which haunts all progression, and he can\u2019t manage deleting his character. I am the one who owns the switch which makes this even harder, as I can\u2019t even buy a new game or a new account for this game.","Having to share an Island between two players was fine. I've just found out only player 1 could progress the save and get the museum built... The second player cannot progress the game. This ruins the game for me as the second player... I would have happy if both players could progress the game but clearly the second player was a second thought... Very disappointing..","El segundo jugador en modo local, no tiene las mismas opciones de juego que el principal, est\u00e1 muy limitado el juego","Really disappointed to discover we can't have an island each, even if we bought two copies of the game.  My sister bought a copy on my switch and now I can't play the game properly.  Please fix this.","Back in the days, you were able to buy multiple games so you had multiple cities. Why the senseless limitations? Well, I guess I know already: Greed. Really sad to see Nintendo use methods like that to incentivize switch purchases.","Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a nice time if you\u2019re player is the first one on the island. But I was the second, and I\u2019m done with the game, as it\u2019s a pretty lame experience. Take that into consideration if you\u2019re looking to buy knowing that two or more in the household want to play - it can cause a lot of tension and arguments, and that\u2019s not something to introduce to the family when it should be something that brings happiness.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be buying another Nintendo console. I can see this game was designed to push console sales, and it\u2019s a bit disappointing and offensive, really. They\u2019re making some money now, but likely at the expense of potential later profits.","This is the most important game of all time. You must play it dont look at ratings just trust me.","I played the original AC to death on my Gamecube back in the day, so I should be the ideal player for this game. But while I've grown this game's shallow formula sure hasn't.\r The co-op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion. But my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012's New Leaf and in fact seems like a step back in places (tool durability? Really, Reggie?). Animal Crossing is a game that has a small amount of quality content parceled out each day, much like a mobile game, which then quickly tapers off to painful grinding. That was okay when I was playing New Leaf on my 3DS on the train or wherever, because I had a few minutes to do meaningful content each day while waiting on other stuff, but as a sit-down console game it's just a waste of time and attention.\r Even worse in my eyes is how awfully stingy the game is and how strictly it dictates the fun you are allowed to have and when you're allowed to have it. It's like playing a boardgame with a spoiled child who wants to tell you what to do on your own turns. You're constantly being told where to go, which NPC to listen to, what to look at, what your goals should be (regardless of whether you care at all), and then when you're finally let loose it's with a monumental financial yoke around your neck.\r Honestly this game feels like a huge load. If you've managed to resist the hype please do give it a pass unless Nintendo eventually does some kind of update to fix things (though don't expect the slog to change, that's here to stay). I'm giving it two points because they certainly made an Animal Crossing game, and this would've been hot **** in 2001, but I don't think I'll pick it up again. Which is too bad, because as the Island Dictator, my absentee character will absolutely kneecap the progress my roommate is allowed to make. Great stuff, Nintendo.","The fact that only one player per console can have their own island or any kind of control over the progression of the island is absolutely ridiculous. I am absolutely boggling that any company thought that would be acceptable to players. If I thought I stood a chance at getting a refund for a $60 game that only one of us can play, I would try.","One island per console makes this game unplayable for anyone but me (the first person who happened to play it) in my household.Fun otherwise.","http://chng.it/DtcNzMgrk5\rHere is a petition to make the multiple changes much discussed here and elsewhere.\rPlease spread this link around. Thank you.","I was spinning my wheels upgrading my house and waiting for the main story elements like upgrading island. Eventually i learned that the band developers block  all except the main switch account from making progress in the game.  I bought ghf game and basically it completely sucks and has no story backbone because the creators decided to block 2ndary accounts.","It pains me to score this game so low, I've actually really enjoyed the first two weeks of gameplay and have been waiting for its release since it was announced.\rIt retains all the likeable features of the older games in the series and adds a variety of new mechanics and experiences that makes it feel so refreshing to play; easily a 10/10 in that regard.\rHOWEVER!\rMyself and, as evident from the User Score Distribution above, 50% of the player base were the unlucky ones. How? Let me braked down why this game failed so many people:\r 1. Shared Console, Shared Island\rNow I personally don't mind sharing my Animal Crossing world with my brother. Creating an aesthetic together and foraging really harks back to our childhood. The option to play simultaneously on the one screen is also a great, much needed addition to the series, but why isn't it optional??\rNintendo decided that each Switch console will be limited to ONE ISLAND per system. That means if you and whoever you may share your console with want to play this game, you will be forced to live together on the island indefinitely. All island data is stored locally on the console, so no amount of $$$ spent on separate game cartridges will ever solve this, so if you want a different island, you'll need another console AND another copy of the game.\rThe Switch is the most powerful and innovative Nintendo system to date, with a default storage of 32GB. Animal Crossing New Horizons is 6.4GB before any save data is stored, and after a combined playtime of 60hrs between myself and my brother, the game now takes up 6.5GB of our total storage! An additional 100MB for two accounts and a whole island?! That's it?! Surely each account could have the option to share an island or have one to themselves?! This is so disheartening as this is such a primitive move by Nintendo... but it's not even the worst.\r First in, First Served\rNow the whole appeal of this new game was the fact that you were no longer limited to only decorating the interior of your home. Placing buildings wherever you want, inviting residents to your town, starting construction on bridges and ramps, the ability to carve rivers into the landscape ... if you were the first user to play the game on your shared console.\rAny person who decides to join your island after you will be almost indefinitely restricted to shaking trees, fishing, and popping balloons. Yes of course there are a few more features to play with and enjoy, but how long will these last before they become tedious for player 2?\rUnfortunately i was the second user to join a New Horizons island and as I approach my 50th hour of gameplay, I'm beginning to feel ripped off. For any progression to happen to our island requires my brother (player 1) to play the game as much as i do so that he gets the prompt to upgrade the shop, or place a new building, or build a new bridge. And what happens when my bother loses interest in the game? Will I have to consistently log him in and out to progress? Will I have to restart our island? There is a sense of pride and individuality that you hold for your unique villager. Swapping to my brother's villager to receive building privileges would allow me to build the things i want, but deep down I feel I'm being stripped of achievement and that my villager is basically useless.\r With these setbacks I believe the game only deserves a 2/10, but I'm holding onto a hope that in a future update Nintendo will fix these issues for their otherwise perfect game.","Forcing you to buy a second console if a 2nd player wants to play is a huge scumbag move and should not be tolerated! Do not buy this game if there 2 players in your household","This is falsely advertised as a local multiplayer game. Party Mode is just singleplayer with the others only allowed to walk around. The Resident Representative mechanic locks all the other players out of making any progression in the game.This is a very good game for one player, but I refuse to give it a single point because I am disgusted with what Nintendo can get away with.","As if being quarantined in real life wasn\u2019t enough, the creators thought it was appropriate to quarantine you with your household in the game as well. And it gets worse, they implemented dictator rules so only the first person to play actually gets to enjoy the game fully like making choices and advancing in the game while everyone else at most is a supporting character by force. They don\u2019t even get a tutorial on how to play. Absolutely the most anti family friendly move from a family friendly console. Trash game.","Seen ea oops sorry nintendo wanting us to buy more switches in tha family is dissapointing... Especially for those of us who are supporting the company and its games till day 1","Rip off. In a time when real life resources are scarce due to record shattering global unemployment numbers, the greedy suits at Nintendo expect their loyal fans to shell out hundreds (thousands, depending on household size) of dollars in order for everyone in your household to have the same full game experience. One switch? One game copy? To bad, peasants! Only one member of your house can have the full game experience while everyone else is left chopping wood, clacking stone, and sneaking into their 6 year old's game account at night to see any game progress at all because said 6 year old is a do-nothing Island Rep who only wants to chase butterflies all day. For the uninitiated,  the Island Rep is the only player who can trigger missions and game progress. They are the only one who can place structures, complete \"story\" missions, and have access to certain DIY recipes and mission rewards.You'll never see what's on the other side of that river unless you have a vaulting pole. You'll never have a vaulting pole unless you bring Blathers to the island. And, you'll never bring Blathers to the island unless you have a clandestine play session on your child's account after they fall asleep. Worst yet, you're left explaining to your child why their precious \"common butterlfy\" is no longer in their inventory while your Nintendo overlords greedily lap up the tears of your 6 year old as retribution for your insolence in not shelling out the small fortune to buy 4 Switches and 4 game copies.","I don't get what this obsession is with New Horizons.

Probably the most annoying thing for a solo player would be Island Designer's slow progression.\r As I played by myself, obviously I did not have the problems with additional players; however, that is really frustrating that people would have to deal with that issue by purchasing another console.","ACNH be like log on, check which NPC is on the island (it\u2019s probably Sahara), find a duplicate DYI on the beach, check the shops, find a cute accessory for a table you don\u2019t have, show fossils to blathers (nothing new, ever), jock type says you look ripped today, close switch.\r Villagers start getting passive aggressive when i talk to them more than one time in a day, I miss when they would ask me for a specific favors, or a fruit to get them, or schedule a time to come hang out at our houses.\r If I have to abandon the game every two weeks until the next update it\u2019s not an engaging game.\r The fact that the jock villagers ONLY talk about working out gets old soooo quickly. Villager dialogue is so lame and repetitive that I barely talk to my villagers anymore. I just talk to the first 3 I see to get the nook miles and then carry on. Wasted potential, honestly.\r Older games had much more dialogue and more personable. Booted up New Leaf the other day and Purrl randomly asked if I believed in UFOs or not. I miss that stuff.\r Congratulations, $60 ACNH as achieved mobile f2p game engagement levels...\r What\u2019s sad is this game is being drip fed content; in New leaf by this time many could have a cafe be out hunting for gyroids, still seeing new furniture sets, out enjoying island mini games or diving around for water things..\r New horizons feels lacking compared to new leaf...","I never loved animal crossing but all my friend had fun playing this game so i've already buy it for my girl friend and i think i will do my island but i was on my girl island and i think its a bug so i go on internet and see you can only have one island per switch i always loved nintendo but now they drop for me","With 1 Switch console in my household, my brother is island representative. My character can do practically nothing except tend to my own home, and cannot actually progress the island (in other words, have bought half a game)","one island for one NS is unacceptable! And the multi-player experience is TERRIBLE! Basicly 2p 3p and 4p is watching 1p playing all the time. They can do very limited things. This is a game for single player!","I really enjoy this game. It's super charming and wholesome. It's the perfect game for the times we're going through right now. The game only has one major problem and that's the island system and clunky inventory controls. The game desperately needs some quality of life changes. other than that, it's great. highly recommend","For the price of the game having a issue like the Resident Representative locking system is not acceptable. Being forced to switch account to play, doesn't make any sense.","I now you can create one Island but is very very good game.\rAnimal Crossing series haven't a fantastic life but this game is the best of the best when we are in homes (because COVID19).\r10/10","I wanted this game so bad, and bought three copies, one for me and the others for my best friends.I started to play and two weeks later my girlfriend wanted to play too.We discover that she could do nothing without me in \"our island\".I asked my friends to borrow me their copies of the game, to discover that even with other cartridge, was the Same **** I regret every penny spend in that game. I changed my animal crossing por a xone control.","I wanted to love this game but i just can't when the game has the insane restriction of only 1 island per switch. meaning that if you are one of the many people that share a switch with multiple people TOO BAD! You're gonna have to share an island with the first person that boots up the game. And if that wasn't bad enough you can hardly do anything on the island without the permission of the island owner. This restriction was not done because of technical limitations but because Nintendo was greedy and wanted to reach their slimy disgusting hands into your wallet to take even more money from you. So thanks Nintendo. Thanks for putting unnecessary restrictions on your game that prevent certain people from enjoying a product that they paid for.","It\u2019s such a boring game! Features are coming slowly and lately, swimming supposed to be in the game anyway. Also, can\u2019t transfer data to other console and can\u2019t even use cloud system for backup. This game doesn\u2019t deserve $60","Unfortunately I have to rate this game twice lower. For a single player this is game is nice but it\u2019s totally not recommended for a household with one console. You can only have ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH and only the first user to start the game - the founder - gets full experience. The rest can get no quests, no proper interactions with NPCs and are limited in many other ways, such as the progress of the founder. You also have to share all the resources. I don\u2019t see anything relaxing or social in this, only disappointment.\rI hope Nintendo will fix this and do it ASAP. It\u2019s totally inappropriate and inhuman to make people buy an extra console and I think no one in the right mind is going to do so.","Cannot progress when you're not first player who starts up the game. Useless. Want money back","Absolutely charming and relaxing game for all ages. The game is made primarily with single player in mind, but can be enjoyed with friends. The game is meant to be played in short bursts and is wonderful for sharing with the whole family. Daily and seasonal changes are sure to keep players coming back to see what's new. The changes to the franchise give more control than ever before to let the denizens of an animal crossing village customize to their heart's content. Finally the DIY system has completely overhauled the game allowing for crafting a multitude of useful new items. This is a must buy for fans of the series and a strong recommend for anyone looking to enjoy casual bouts of exploration into the once again fresh world of animal crossing.","A bad joke, just one island per Switch really playable. If you are a family with one switch, you will be pissedOff. Nintendo, shame on you. Once again you give a **** on happy customers.","1 island per console it's like being in the 90's.\r Nintendo ruined this game","It's a solid 7/10 cute little game for killing time on a chill island, but only one person per console gets to fully experience the game.  It's designed to push you to buy a second switch.","Going to Join the down train here. I returned my copy of AC:NH due to the single island per switch issue. Oh, you want me to go buy ANOTHER console and ANOTHER copy of the game if I want my own island that I can maintain and my girlfriend wants the same? Seriously Nintendo? If this **** gets fix I may get the game again.","In line with other reviews, i just discovered that the first player obtains MAJOR benefits over the second/third players etc. While i do love the idea of building an island together with other players, what options do second players get to build? They don't get invited to:\r - get new DIY recipes for welcoming new villagers;\r- help upgrade the island;\r- participate in new projects.\r Understandably, everybody but the first player is losing interest. All they can do is mine resources, after all.. Can this be fixed? I would love for other players to:\r - Receive the same DIY recipes for new villagers;\r- Actually being able to contribute to setting up housing for these new villagers.","They only allow one island per console. Allowing one only was a big mistake, would not recommend if you share a console.","This is a great entry for the Animal Crossing Franchise. The single player experience is just fantastic. I can\u2019t wait to see what other players will do with their islands. I\u2019m loving it, it\u2019s fun, quirky and most of all very relaxing. To answer all the criticism coming from those who gave the game ZERO as a score: true, the one island per console is a very weird choice but it was said soooo many times and it\u2019s written on the box as well. Read a review, a faq, watch a video on YouTube before you buy! You have no one else to blame but yourself if you bought something without gathering the (readily available) and necessary information.","This game is absolutely amazing as a constant side game for one's day. It a great game to relax with.","Annoying, repetitive, a tedious hassle, way too simple on tutorials while also not giving gameplay tips/important guidal info. Could have been really good if made by someone else. Could have had a good co-op for those that aren't rich. Dragged out. Not recommended for kids, or adults unless you enjoy a simple yet complicated game.","Best relaxing game! Must buy! And go to ... ... haters for 0 rating, your point make people not interest in game.","One Island per console? Is it a joke? This is an instant 0/10. It's absolutely ridiculous. Please don't support the developers, don't buy this game.","Terrible decision here by Nintendo to force users to buy multiple Switches and games just to be able to fully play the game when there may be multiple players in a household. As it stands, only the first person that logs in on the same switch gets the full version of the game.","Only the first person to create a character can play the full game. All subsequent characters are inhabitants of the first person's island, and they cannot do anything progress related. My partner and I are both gamers and are very angry that only one of us can have the full experience, without shelling out $200 on another console. It is like the rest of the family is stuck shadowing while one person actually plays the game. Big let down - I was hoping this would be something cute and fun to entertain the family, but it is stressing everyone out.","I don't like leaving bad reviews like this, but it's the only option for me as a consumer. The 1 island restriction is trash and far worse than previous games. The second player has an overall worse experience with many features locked out from them, and unlike previous games this is not solved by simply buying a new memory card or a second game cart. This is not consumer friendly and forces players in the same household to buy multiple Switches if they want the full experience. At least in New Leaf you can transfer your house as the second player if you wanted to be the mayor of your own town, such a feature is not possible here. To add insult to injury the lack of real Cloud Saves is a joke, especially when it's a service we pay extra for. A first party service like Cloud Saves should be compatible with all first party games.","You can only have one island per console, welcome to 2000 Nintendo. **** YOU","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game. Honestly, it's very good so far.\r However, I'm giving this game a bad score because of the mangled couch co-op / multiple profile experience. The first profile to start the game becomes the Resident Representative. This is the only player who is able to further progress the story / quests. The second player is merely a glorified island resident. Why did Nintendo decide to not let me, the second player, place homes, help with tasks or even get the same recipes as the first player?\r Here's a list of what I'm not able to do:\r- I do not get the same DIY recipes (this includes things like the axe, shovel, etc. Essential tools!)\r- I am not asked to help upgrade the island\r- I am not invited to participate in new projects\r- I cannot help my girlfriend with her own island projects\r- I am not even allowed to check in-progress projects to see what resources are needed.\r Tom Nook literally tells me to ask my girlfriend what she needs.\r The multiple profile experience has been absolutely horrid so far and managed to seriously impact how my girlfriend and I play this game together. We were very excited about this game and were ultimately let down. Thanks, Nintendo.","This game is really disappointing, we waited nearly 8 Whole years hoping for a much better game than this! Even Happy Home Designer was a much better game than New Horizons!\rLike why is there is no dating option? Let me marry my favorites Marshal and Isabelle already, even Stardew Valley got it right!\rAnd what's with the mexican stuff in this game? This is supposed to be a game for the AC fans, not SJWs, it just makes no sense why they would include that trash in an AC game.\rAnd lastly let us have multiple island on one console! I can't just use one island for my Tumblr posts, I need multiple!\rThis really won't be tolerated Nintendo, you treated Smash and Pokemon much better but still push the AC community aside. Would Not Recommend!","I made this account just to say how horrifically greedy Nintendo are for making users share a game save across the console. I don't know if any other game that force you to do this.The game pace is set my the initial character. You share the same destination and  cannot progress past the initial players position. If you have multiple kids or anyone wanting to play this seperately, too bad. You don't just have to buy a seperate game cartridge you need a WHOLE NEW CONSOLE meaning if you want your own saved game, you have to pay literally HUNDREDS just for the pleasure of doing so. Nintendo can take their console, lube it up with the tears of their disappointed customers and shove it up their money hungry nook hole.We've been waiting 7 years and this is what you do. Thanks I'm SO glad I waited for this game.","I had such high hopes for this game, and I was immensely let down. Only being able to have one island is ridiculous. We have to have two separate NSO accounts, but can't have two saves? Nintendo, you are showing your EA colors.","Player one being the only player that can actually access the entire game, in its full is one of the worse gaming mechanics I've ever come across. The fact that the game doesn't even allude to this is what makes it even suck even more. Instant 0 from me for this as it completely ruins the experience for any other player other than the \"Island representative\". cheap, greedy move. Don't even get me started on the pathetic attempt at \"local multiplayer\". classic Nintendo","This Animal Crossing is amazing... As the one account that can actually play the game! Only one account can experience what the game has to offer. All other accounts get to build a home and collect. There is a story to be told and progression in this game that is not shared like the island is. The DIY is VERY limited as well for all other accounts the only way to get what the first resident  has is to buy a completely other switch. This is a modern game, no reason should there be restrictions like this on a game.","So let me start with saying that Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the music is calming, the graphics are cute and the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp. If you are the sole owner of a Nintendo switch, do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer.However there is a MAJOR ISSUE with this game and that lies within sharing the game with other profiles on one console. It's a massive shame that greed has taken hold of Nintendo here and has resulted in some extremely anti-consumer practices. Honestly, I expected more from Nintendo. Basically the first profile on the switch to play this game has the full experience (which again, is great), then the following profiles that play have a watered down version of the game, it's almost as if Nintendo are punishing those who don't own their own console. This practice is very old school and Nintendo are obviously way behind in this area. This is almost EA standard of ant-consumerism and they have bucked up their ideas in recent times. I seriously hope Nintendo sort this issue out, mostly because their greed and anti-consumerism is tarnishing and destroying the reputation of a very good game. For the reasons above I have to give this game a 0/10, such practices shouldn't be happening these days and especially from a company that is so family focused. Thanks for reading.","I hope that Nintendo eventually adds multi-island support. The game is fun until you start to run into roadblocks that ruin the fun for you if you're not the first person to start the game. The fact that you can't play the game in full unless you are the primary player is insane.","As everyone else has said, it just ridiculous to only allow one island account per console, clearly a money move. Didn\u2019t think Nintendo would stoop to being so disrespectful to their fan base and a beloved game.","Probably the best Animal Crossing has ever been, and to fans of the series it does enough to update the core gameplay loop to keep it fresh and interesting.The negative reviews all seem to be people who have never played Animal Crossing before. The one island setup is intentional and has been a thing forever.","For those saying we don't understand animal crossing was always 1 island, THAT IS NOT THE POINT. I fully support the idea of having 1 island, the point is that player 2 is extremely limited (I can't even get an axe as player 2), and cannot progress without player 1 finishing everything. Player 2 can't craft certain items, can't build, can't make decisions, need I say more? All I'm doing as player 2 is paying off my debt to tom nook. Don't know if Nintendo did this on purpose to buy another console, or if they actually dropped the ball on this one.\r Only buy this game if you play alone, or plan on buying multiple consoles and games.","Single player seems more of the same as previous game. Couch co-op don't buy. 1 island per switch coop partner has limited stuff they can do and just follows main player around. We gave up as bought for coop. Should have done more research first. Money wasted","An amazing game and the best AC yet! If you don\u2019t understand there is only one town per system sorry you don\u2019t get AC.","It's ridiculous how only one person can enjoy the game per console, my partner tried to start it after me and couldn't do anything in the island... Only gather resources. It's ridiculous that Nintendo goes this far to push for multiple consoles per household","One island per console, very \"family friendly\". How unbelievably greedy by Nintendo.","Me and my girlfriend bought this. Turns out you can only have one island per CONSOLE, not even per user. The second user basically can\u2019t do anything... can\u2019t trade, can\u2019t place buildings, can\u2019t even get recipes unless they have been unlocked by the first person who played the game. Literally the only work around for this is to buy another Switch. It makes loot boxes look moral. So I have to give it zero because guess what, until my girlfriend is bored of it... I can\u2019t even play it. Thanks, Nintendo.","Bought a Switch and this game for 2 kids who will be spending a lot of time at home for the foreseeable future.  Can only have 1 island???  Very disappointed.","Remove the one island per console restriction! It completely ruins the experience for separate profiles on a shared Switch. This is a home console that gets shared, not JUST a handheld.\r POS game","I am absolutely in love with Animal Crossing: New Horizons! This game could not have come at a better time. What a fun, chill, play at your own pace game. The graphics are wonderful, the jokes are funny. I can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Nintendo for giving us this when we needed it most.","The game is amazing. Ignore the whiney little babies crying about islands and rating it \"0\". Sure, it would be nice to be able to have multiple islands, but this doesn't make an amazing game \"0/10\". They are idiots. The game is great.","Never played AC before this one and I was worried about whether I would like it, but I absolutely adore it. So much fun and just a lovely experience. Couldn't recommend it more.","What's not to love. Would three islands appease you? Me, I'm okay with my one , lah.","Step in and stop review bombing, Metacritic! It\u2019s unfair for developers and gamers.","Greedy tactic from Nintendo of 1 island per switch..! Completely ruined the game for me. Every other game ever made knows not to do this. Shocking.","Pretty fun game. Relaxing, adorable, and simple. I dont see why people are coming in a review bombing it with 0's metacritic should do somthing about this because its really becoming a problem.","Nintendo thinks people like to share an village and t-pose in an empty space with nothing to do other than chat, Since one player get to do all the chores","Animal crossing new horizons is an excellent game is a game that I cannot stop playing it. the day it launched to today, I didn't play any other game, and the online is good there isn't lag, and it's fun, and you gonna have some good laughs","Me and my little sister were so excited to play the new animal crossing. It's our first animal crossing game, so we couldn't wait to play it. When the game arrived I let her play first, but when I started to play on my Switch account I realized that there were some things off. It appears that you can only have 1 island per Console. That's absolutely ridiculous. There is a reason to have multiple Switch accounts and merging the accounts into 1 game is just wrong. It forces us to buy a new Nintendo Switch so that we both can enjoy the FULL experience. She can play the game normally, but I cannot do certain things like: pick an island, naming the island, build bridges, make houses for visitors, can't have DIY recipies and a lot of other things. I basically can only contribute to my sister's island. It's so annoying and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. My excitement went from 100 to 0 real quick. I wasn't really following the news before the release, but apparently they mentioned it in a Three Houses demo live stream. I didn't watched the livestream so I didn't know. All the websites where they sell the game also didn't mention it and the website where I bought the game also said nothing about a 1 island per Console thing. Even the trailers didn't mention it. I'm just so mad about this, I've spend 60 euros and I can't even play the full game. I really want to love this game. It looks Hella fun, but as someone who started the game secondly: it feels more like a slave game. I really hope that they update this whole situation. Let the player choose if they want to share the island or build their own island.","Fun, adorable, relaxing, beautiful design, and in the knick of time. Couldn't ask for more!","This game is fantastic and beautiful. The only thing I would change is incorporating the ability for multiple users on the console to find materials needed for larger projects and drop them off at the project which was a feature in new leaf. You can access everything the main account can by looking in the second page of Tommy and Timmy's store. This game is great.\r These games have always only had one island per console.","My literal only complaint is that I can\u2019t craft in batches. This is a beautiful and amazing game for those of us who have played since the original. I understand frustrations for those who are playing this as their first Animal Crossing. I feel like most of the low reviews come from a lack of understanding of where the game comes from.","This is a beautiful, immersive game with so much to do. The graphics are gorgeous and the range of options and activities you have available to you is incredible. I love sharing an island with my family members. It's something we have done in every other installment in the series and is always a lot of fun!","I created an account to mention how great the game is, and also I paid attention to the fact that as soon as Nintendo talked about multiplayer they talked about one island per console. So I did not just run out to buy this not knowing what I was getting. The game is beautiful, and all the additions made to the game are fantastic, the crafting is great, the fact that you can modify the island is great, now that you are building everything yourself it feels like there is way more to do than the previous games, 10/10","One island per system? Really? This is like owning a car and only one person can set the seats or radio.Also the cloud backup system is, well, it isn't there. So when you do play with a household on switch and something happens to it, everyone loses everything.","Ok we're addicted to this game. The low average is from users putting in zeroes for it not allowing more than one island per switch. Which granted, sucks, but none the less this game is nearly perfect!","This game is most likely the best game I\u2019ve ever played. The amount of things to do is so amazing. However, I can see it not appealing to certain people. This game is a game with basically no action, so if you don\u2019t like relaxing games without the rush a fighting/shooter game would give you, don\u2019t play this. Anyways, 10/10","The game is good. Those butthurt people need to calm down with their reviews. I mean nintendo already announced the save thing before they released the game. No one forced you to buy it...","As has been mentioned many times here already, I do not agree that Nintendo should mandate the \"one user per system\" restriction they have made by allowing the creation of only one island. This game doesn't deserve positive reviews until this is remedied.","Created an account just to review this game. It's great if your 1 player per console but otherwise it's just a demo of the game for everyone but the first person to start. Critical milestones are locked behind progress that only the person who opened the game first can make (the Island Representative).\r A petty marketing gimmick to sell more consoles. Between this and the scummy mobile game, Nintendo is on track to become the next EA.","Need another switch to play with my girlfriend?!? Didnt think multiplayer through at all Nintendo just want you to buy more Switch consoles","Tossing my review in with the rest. I don't mind the sharing the island aspect. A crap idea to be sure, but if that's how the creative minds want to play it then fine I'll play.\r What I find despicable is the 2nd, 3rd, etc players not being to experience a real game. You are in fact a villager that the main player allows the ability to do what they want. I don't know who in Nintendo decided that was a good idea, but imagine living in a household where only one person matters and everyone else is subservient to that one person. Kind of goes against the idea of building social ties, sharing and having fun. Sharing in my mind isn't only sharing space, but also in sharing responsibility and choice.\r The dictatorial feel of the single console multiplayer of this game destroys its value for me as I'm now subservient to player one. I can't do anything other than farm and wait for player one to plan the city out and progress the story. Imagine save locking a pc so only one player can get to play a game. How ridiculous is that? Well welcome to Animal Crossing New Horizons. Want to play the real game like player one? Go buy a new switch.","Would be good, but only allows one island per console. Even if I could tolerate that, having multiple people on the island is also broken. No other accounts on the console can progress until the first account to play the game does. Fix this Nintendo.","Can't have my own island. Can't even progress the game or help villagers setup their house because I'm player 2. Literally walking around waiting for player 1 to do something. Glad I paid $80AUD for one and a half slices of pizza, when they advertised the whole pie. Nintendo hates it's fans, but they don't let their hate for you known until you've already bought their game. Disgusting.","I love the game. But my only issue with it is the necessity to have Nintendo Switch Online to play with friends at all, except for locally which is difficult in this time.","My girlfriend and I were looking forward to playing together using the couch multiplayer mode. It's not much fun as only one player can make progress and the other just has to walk around and pick things up (slowly). I don't even mind that there is only one island like other people are saying (I think it should be a choice). But both players should progress together, or be able to progress at their own pace with the same features and golas, perhaps as co-","The limitation of one island per Switch ?only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters.","The game is essentially for a single user per switch.  All others do not get anywhere close to the full experience.","Great game! The gf and I are sharing the workload and designing the island together... couldnt be happier and it just looks so good on the switch!","Another great installment in the Animal Crossing series.  Keeps the old staples of the series while adding a new but of flavor.  Plenty of customization both inside and outside of your home.","you already know why Im upset it\u2019s a good game but Nintendo needs to add what we\u2019ve been asking for.","My family and I (mom and two daughters) were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise. We were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother, but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game AT ALL. Older installations would share the players in the same town, much like this game, but they DO NOT stop normal progress to secondary players. The most secondary players would have to endure is dealing with whatever name the first player gave the town and sharing a house that could be altered by all of the players on the game. Now, players can\u2019t do so much as chop down a tree or purchase a haircut without going onto the primary account.    Usually these problems would be circumvented by buying another game cartridge to create a separate town, but Nintendo has decided to make the game CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE. Not cartridge exclusive which already has a hefty price of $60, but there is a required additional fee of $200 dollars minimum for a switch lite, which has very limited capabilities, or $300 dollars if you want a competent console. Us players will expect to have to pay an additional $240 to $340 dollars should ONE person get their own chance at actually playing the game within a reasonable capacity that the advertisements and previous expectations Nintendo has lead its audience to believe.   Maybe this could have been avoided because by simply not purchasing the game, but how should avid fans of the Animal Crossing expect this kind of product to come out as non multiplayer friendly? Others could argue that with the last main game, New Leaf, was single player and that New Horizon is technically multiplayer because there are multiple players existing on the same island. Keyword: existing, not playing. The game should be justifiably playable like, y\u2019know, a game. No less a $60 game. New Leaf was advertised as your own experience and your own town because you are the mayor. This experience is uniquely yours and was advertised as so.   Maybe we are expecting too much. Maybe it\u2019s too much to ask for autonomous gameplay for all of the players, despite that capability being apparent in other games on the switch such as Pok\u00e9mon and on older AC games on inferior consoles, despite the switch being capable of running beautifully rendered and complex games such as Zelda BOTW, it must be too much for the game. Sadly, we were advertised, very strongly might I add, that the game would be capable of multiplayer in its many advertisements. We were told many players can participate in Nintendo\u2019s \u201cIsland Paradise\u201d when the reality is that only one player with a sizable sum of money can experience this \u201cIsland Paradise\u201d while the secondary players are basically forced to watch as this \u201cParadise\u201d taunts them for not paying the $300 gateway fee.   I hope that future purchasers of the game take all of these points into account and choose to buy this game if they are buying for a single person because this game is by no means suitable for a family or even a pair of friends as turbulence can arise from there being only one person allowed to play the game. My family certainly experienced turbulence and I wish this game has never graced our home. Furthermore, families with multiple switch consoles should wait until the price of the game drops dramatically because other games at a similar price offer so much more.  Tldr don\u2019t buy Animal Crossing New Horizons if more than one person will play it.","Obviously a cash grab from Nintendo.   Anyone who played animal crossing before shouldn\u2019t expect the same experience with this.One island per switch and you have to pay to get more ? What happened providing a game where everyone in the household can play they own game ? Seriously disappointed. Skip","i'm having fun so far but there are so many downsides to this game.... we essentially got an unfinished game that will be upgraded and fixed with future downloadable updates..","This game is fantastic. Relaxing, a lot to do and achieve, it doesn't get boring that easily!\r Now what's dumb is how people cry about the fact that there's only one island per console. The game is more open than the other entries into the series. Cmon, get over yourself and deal with it for now. It isn't even a valid reason for you to rate it with 0 just because of this.","ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE\r I am forced to rate this game very low because of the egregious pricing caused by a limitation put on this game. The limitation of only being able to have ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE. Every other game i have i can share with others in my household.

On top of this there is no cloud save functionality.\r I would happily rate this game a 9 if this wasn't the case but as it stands family's with multiple children are forced to not buy the game or buy multiple switches so each person has the option to play the same game, a requirement that does not exist for any other game I am aware of on any home console.\r If these two issues are rectified I will update the review score to a 9","I play by sharing the console with my girlfriend, I am the second profile, it's a joke, I have access to no projects, no decisions. I'm just decorating the island and giving resources to player 1.\rI have never seen a game so tightly held, it's a shame. So that we have a great concept game, addictive but which very quickly frustratating the the player 2.","My issues with the game are the lack of any sort of meaningful options menu, the tight unforgiving timing requirements for fishing and certain bug catching, and the shear amount of busywork that the game requires you to do in order to progress. The best ways of making money require a good sense of timing, or those activities can easily take twice as long or longer. I admit, I have a bad sense of timing, but i don't play rhythm games, so why are those types of mechanics showing up in a 'relaxing island getaway.'\rI feel that the game has zero respect for player time, i.e. the crafting menu is atrocious, and trying to craft multiple things at once is a nightmare, and players are forced to sit through slow (unchangeable) dialog for most actions they take. Also, the arguably biggest achievement (golden tools) are now mostly useless as they only have about 3x the durability of the previous tools. That's right, the things that take almost a YEAR to unlock are not much better than the middle tier of tools.","Super disappointed. It looks like fun. My girlfriend never plays video games and in the midst of COVID-19 thought something to keep her occupied was a good idea. And she has been enjoying it while I've been working from home. And I was very excited to play it but when I started it put me on her island. I checked the internet and then the box and in fine print it says you can only have one island on one switch. I'm sorry I didn't check first but why would anybody expect that or expect Nintendo to have fine print. I never played animal crossing before so I didn't know that was the standard for these games. Just expected this to be another great game for the switch and now I'm just disappointed Nintendo would screw users like this. Thanks for wasting my time and money. Never been so disappointed in a Nintendo product. Glad I haven't bought Mario Party and let my friends suffer the lack of care Nintendo had providing awful online multiplayer and 4 boards.","The game lacks the feature of Cloud Saving or, at least, transferring progress between consoles. As someone who is going to be playing this game a lot and wishes to upgrade to a better, more expensive console, this is horrible. People will refuse to upgrade consoles just because of the progress on their islands.","I have played Animal Crossing New Horizons and New Leaf, and while New Horizons is a decent game for simple improvements to the ways of game mechanics, it remains imperfect in the aspect that you still have to grind through dialogue to do quality-of-life things like crafting fish bait. However, as I said, it still is better in that aspect over previous installments as your materials automatically stack. Aside from that simple gameplay adjustment, I honestly believe New Leaf, which was on the Nintendo 3DS is better than this Nintendo Switch title. My reasons?New Leaf put you in a role where you have an entire city at the mercy of your ordinances and it truly felt like you were making a difference in not just your mayor chair, but in the virtual lives of your villagers, whom will occasionally ask you to run errands or generally ask your opinion on something. Sure, New Horizons has the later of that statement, but you can play the entire game and not care about whether a villager leaves because it is very apparent that they are no different than interacting with AOL back in the day. I have told Nintendo these recommendations, but they have yet to listen. I told them that they should re-add the island fruit/tortimer Island/minigames back into the series, considering you are on an island and the multiplayer aspect of it is only really good if your friend needs one of your cherries, as there is no activities for you to do with them and when they visit, perhaps you could play hide and seek since you cannot see them, special npcs, or even your own villagers wondering on the map. It is bad when Pocket Camp, a game that is on the phone, has triple the content of this new installment. Yes, I understand Nintendo said they will update it for up to three years, but it makes a customer like myself believe that Nintendo just released an incomplete product and is trying to intrigue someone with that status for future updates when they cut so much content from the series. You are on an island, cannot dive or swim, cannot find island fruit on island tours, cannot find the DIY recipes you want unless you use third-party sites like Nookazon, and even then, you may not want to deal with someone asking 13 million bells for just 1 cherry.The bottom line is this game is missing SO MUCH content and I feel a need to play New Leaf because this game is incomplete, lacks anything truly fun, and when Nintendo talks about three years of updates to such a stale game, they basically are telling every customer that bought it that their game, that they pay $60 to have and $20 to play online with, will not be truly complete until three years. You know, part of the fun I have had in New Leaf was time travelling to holidays when I would get bored, but you cannot do that because they are so afraid that people will spoil a holiday that tells people to collect stamps or take a few wedding photos for characters that should have already been in the game for furniture customization. This is the worst animal crossing game I EVER played and maybe after three years it would be the best, but who wants to wait three years to enjoy a game at full experience?FYI, all these positive reviews on here seem to be made by someone who was paid to say those things because how can they be okay with a secondary player feeling left out in their experience? How could they defend this trash of a game that should have not been released till evidently three years later when it would be complete? I am not saying it isn't an enjoyable game, but try New Leaf before you leave your review; I bet your opinion will change because compared to New Leaf, this is a skeleton in the series, waiting for meat and skin to be truly whole.","DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you have more than one person who wants to play this on the same Switch.\r Animal Crossing (AC) continues with it's tried and tested formula of grind materials to make things to sell in the grind for bells (Capitalism at it's best).  In the words of Tod Howard, it just works.  And that's fine, this game has and will always be, a grind.  MMOs thrive off this and so does AC.  And for Player 1, AC ties in some thin story to help make the grind feel like an achievement.  For ANY other player, you're stuck in an endless loop of grind WITHOUT any story.\r For additional Players (do remember that Nintendo have a ONE ISLAND per Switch policy), there is no story and so no achievement reward for improving the island and so you're forced into essentially a glorified Fishing Simulator.  Craftable items that are locked to the story, yeah, Player 1 will have to craft them and give them to the additional players (some of these do appear in the shop once unlocked, but not all).\r It screams cash grab from Nintendo, forcing parents to purchase multiple Switch devices for the warring kids over who should be Player 1 and get the full AC experience or be relegated to a Player controllable NPC.  For the price of another Switch plus the game, I can see why Nintendo would be rather slow to patch this as the longer it goes, the more devices they'll likely sell.\r My suggestion is, as the first line says, NintenDON'T buy this game if you share your Switch.  If you're a lone Switch Wielding Warrior, then I can recommend this to a point.  As others have said, there should be two scores for this title, as 2 is a bit low for the single player experience.  However, it is advertised as a Multiplayer game, which it clearly is not.\r Still looking for a time consuming build up your own unique world?  I can fully recommend Stardew Valley as Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has really gone up and above with this title and won't leave anyone feeling left out, relegated to generic tasks.","One island per console. Obvious ploy to encourage households to purchase more than one switch. It\u2019s ludicrously greedy and immoral.","I was really wanting to get this game. But after talking with friends it seems like a waste. I intended to be able to share the console with other members of my family who were also interested in this game. But the one island per console system has made that an impossibility. It is ridiculous to suggest that multi person families should shell out $200-300 per console plus a frankly overpriced $60 per game copy as well. This is greedy and a poor move on Nintendos part. At this point I probably wont even buy a switch, because I dont like supporting money grubbing companies like this one. I dont know who along the development line thought this was a reasonable decision, but it seems like they've caused a huge loss in potential sales as a lot of people seem to have decided against the game/console due to this greedy tactic. Considering the console itself is already overpriced for what it is, I'm not sure Nintendo  products are worth investing in anymore.","Fix the local multiplayer already. Only one person really gets to experience the full game while everyone else is limited in what they can build and do. There\u2019s been enough public outcry that Nintendo should be addressing this.","An absolutely awesome addition to the franchise. Everything about this game has been tailor made for longtime fans of the series. There's a ridiculous amount of quality of life upgrades to the game, any fan of the series will adore the game!","If you're planning to play with more than one person the second player is really more of an afterthought. They get their own house and items but they can't progress the story and actually miss out on some of the interactions. The game seems really fun but it is incredibly greedy to not allow both players to have a full experience without owning additional switches.","Leaving it at 0 until nintendo fixes their 60 dollar game. This game is no fun if your a second profile onto the game. The 1st to log on has more privileges and fun than anyone else in the game","I am an hour and a half into the game before i realize that I'm playing on my wife's island. Nintendo made a terrible decision to not have an option to have your own island on a separate profile. This is obviously a ploy to force your clientele to purchase another copy. Shame, I've been looking forward to this game for a while. Needless to say i will not be buying another copy and not reccomend this game to anyone who has a friend or family  who wants to play","I am not the kind of person to throw a big fit when I can't get my way. I understand some games are just not my style, and that's fine. My problem here, however, is that this *is* my kind of game, but I can't play it because I had the audacity to give it to my daughter for her birthday.\r Oh, don't get me wrong, she loves it. But she gets to do anything she wants on it, doesn't she? I don't. I had the unfortunate luck to be the **** that is player 2, and for some reason unknown to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence, Nintendo decided to gate EVERYTHING behind player one's progress.\r I can't even get an axe right now. And I am not going to yell at my 10-year old to hurry up. She discovering the game and loving it. I don't want to ruin it for her. If I had the chance to ruin the day/week/life of the developers that thought this was a good idea, I'd take it in a heartbeat, though.\r If you want to play an amazing game, live by yourself, or have no worries of completely screwing over everyone else in your house that might want to play this game, go for it. If you have multiple people, make sure you buy multiple copies of the game. Oh, yeah. but multiple switch consoles (one for each person that wants to play) because it is one save per game per console.\r Absolutely freaking infuriating, Nintendo. Five games in my house that want to play this - myself, my husband, two of my sons, and my daughter. I already bought the family online account that you force to be a year in length. I've already replaced the freaking POS joycons that are prone to stick drift, and then sent both sets in to get repaired. The console has lost sound from anything but plugging into the dock for HDMI. The left hand rail won't connect to the controller. All of that, and you still have to bend me over and penetrate me with this decision on Animal Crossing.\r I would ask for lube with how much you have bent us over, but I am not sure my daughter has unlocked it yet.","Very disappointed with how they are limiting multiplayer. My wife and I are managing to share but this is not going to be good in a household with children. Changing my rating as the game is wonderful. But it is so hard not to be upset with how they could employ a few things to fix this.","this game is great and similar to other life sim games. It\u2019s unfair to rate this a 0/10 because Nintendo doesn\u2019t cater to your 10 person family. However, I do think that you should\u2019ve be able to buy more than one copy per console. But the idiots out there who think that you should let 10 people start their own island per copy is kinda dumb. Overall, the games has some heavily needed QOL updates and for that I can only rate it 8/10.","Honest answer, my wife plays the game almost exclusively but i have enjoyed as well. Personally i disagree with the single island issue but comparing it to EA's egregious Lootboxes and scummy tactics i think is serious hyperbole. Its a genuinely fun sandbox game with a few flaws, it is not meant to have a deep complex narrative other than the one you make for yourselves. Please stop overreacting this is almost as bad and cringe as the astral chain and fire emblem review bombings. Lets discuss the issues like mature adults and try to get Nintendo to respond in kind, not scorched earth tactics we're better than this.","It's more entertaining and intuitive than New Leaf. The menus are easier to navigate. There's more stuff to do. It's also very pretty despite the simple character models. But I'd prefer this style as opposed to a realistic art style, PS fanboys. New Horizons is a treat.","Parental warning: this game contains LGBT agenda driven content.The game has been altered for the western version, gender selection has been removed by the Japanese developer for the west (according to them, due to pressure by agenda pushers from Nintendo of America). It also contains a lesbian reference through an altered dialogue (meaning, the dialogue is different in the Japanese version) between the player and a non-player cat where she mentions that her favorite romantic comedy is between two princesses. Parents be cautious these days and read more about the games you purchase for your children.","Didn\u2019t plan on making a review but am doing my part to protect this masterpiece from review bombing. This game is wonderful, have played for around 25 hours over the last few days and collecting resources to upgrade the island and design your house is great. If you wanted multiplayer then I\u2019m sorry but Animal Crossing has always been mostly single player, not sure what you were expecting. Buy it, I beg you.","The game reminds me of the much-needed escapism Captain America provided to children and soldiers alike during WWII. The game is perfect other than the fact that Nintendo is making me share my island with my family. I wish island sharing was optional. If this is changed in future updates, I will change my ranking to 10. I don't understand why Nintendo is so anti-fun and has to backtrack on anything good they do. The sharing has gotten so bad, that my sister removed me from our island on this game Nintendo charged $60 for and I can't play it anymore.","i'm sure ACNH is amazing for player 1 but player 2 is gimped to all hell and has barely any say in what goes on. there is no way to play 2 islands on one switch and i refuse to buy a second switch to play it.","This game is honestly so great, with everything going on in the world right now it's nice to have a peaceful escape, some users are leaving bad reviews about limitations of multiple people living on one island but fail to realize new leaf also limited non mayor's of what they can do. Besides how calming the game is, it looks great, there were a couple things in the beginning of the game, like donating a single item at a time to blathers, but if you progress it'll get better","It is my first animal crossing and i am enjowing it a lot, I am doing every single thing i can do and that's a lot of thinks also the collect of all bugs, fishes and fossils is one of my favourite entertiments.I can understand why people are annoyed by the fact that is only one island per switch, but is a nice coop too, for people who share island, to build it together, i am doing it with my little brother and we talk about what happens to one or another in the island. Althrough only I am the founder of the island, he can do the same things than me, so is the same gameplay for us both.The art, as music, graphics and gameplay looks good, it just feels the way it must, I think, but there are things that could be better, for example at buying many things, i would like to buy 31 thibgs for examole, instead of doing it in packs of 5, or individually.In general i am enjoying this game a lot, but it's not perfect, so almost 10 for me.","The text can be lengthy and slow at times but it makes sense. Only one island per console is also a bummer but not worth dropping it that far down. It's an overall fun experience with cute characters, fun multiplayer, and cool options of what you can do in the game.","This game is fantastic. Hate having one island? Buy another switch.","Multiplayer is broken. There is several issues with the multiplayer for non-representative resident players. They are severely limited in progressing the game: The non-RR player is:-Unable to unlock the DIY recipes acquired through progressing game -Lacks access to purchasing items from the catalog that the representative player has bought/unlocked-Cannot use or unlock emotes -Cannot increase relationship with villagers-The non-RR is unable to progress in the game beyond what the representative player has made that day. And often, not even that and is unable to progress at all-The second player serves almost no purpose. If you share an island and are the non-RR character, the game is rendered essentially pointless. It desperately needs to be patched","An absolutely wonderful game. I've played every Animal Crossing to date and this is the most polished so far, great mechanics. However, the game completely halts progress for second and subsequent players. Despite having a great time with what I have already played, I'm not going to go back to it because I can't really do much except customize my house and pay my debt, which is beginning to get repetitive. I will update this with a better rating if Nintendo either allows the second player to progress the same as the first player or lets us create multiple islands (which would be preferable). Until then, especially if you want to play this with your family, don't bother.","Ignore the negative ratings. Solid game and a lot of fun.","I haven't stopped playing this since it came out.. I'm surprised I'm not writing this in Animalese.","Best game in the series, people complain about the multiplayer, they clearly never played ac before.","While it is indeed sad you're limited to one islsnd per console, i think it's weird that people are rating this game 0/10. Really? Are you guys so sad that because a game doesn't have a popular feature, it deserves to be review-bombed? In any case, that just proves it's success. A mediocre game wouldn't get review-bombed.Anyway,This game is very fun, very family friendly, and deserves all the praise it gets!","Online multiplayer is painful with more than 2 player. The constant loading when player join and left leave you locked to loading screen. No online backup at launch is simply bad planning.","The game is nice, if you are the first player and therefore the 'owner' of the island. If you are second player, you are tied to the progress of the first, which is really annoying and takes away from the game. Basically only the first player has some kind of story, all others just don't, therefore it is just plain boring.\rSharing the island in itself is no problem for me at all, but not being able to do all things I want to do, without switching character, is.\rOtherwise it is quite relaxing, as animal crossing always was. The tools breaking can be annoying at times, too, but you learn to work around it. The graphics are super cute, and being able to create the clothing I want is great, too.","I was looking forward to playing this game, but the inability for different users to have their own islands makes it so I literally cannot play this game. My girlfriend started an Island, and she wants to play her Island her way. I want to play my own Island, but I can't. My only option (fun as it may be) is to play on my girlfriend's island, unable to make decisions and unable to move around freely. The game is great, I just wish I could play it. I have no choice but to give it a 0 since I'm not even allowed to play! Nintendo, please reverse this decision and let me play your game!!","My sister bought this game not knowing that we couldn\u2019t have separate islands. This was a problem because I was the first one in my family to play the game, and I even got pretty far. The fact that I had progressed up to the construction of the museum ended up being a problem because as my sister found out she could not register new creatures with Tom Nook and so she was stuck using a flimsy rod and net on half of the island. This mad my sister very upset seeing as she had just payed $90 to play this game and now she was stuck on 2% of it. After searching many websites I found that there was no way for her to get a new island or even tools so I made the decision to delete the file I had spent hours on so that my sister could play. Come on Nintendo stop being petty and forcing people to buy a new switch just make it so people can have multiple islands on your family console.","Nintendo, this is greedy! The only reason to limit one island per console is to force your gamers to buy more switch console. Please listen to your gamers. I'm a long time fan of the series and is really disappointed to see this happening on switch console. The purpose of having different gaming account on your console is for your gamers to enjoy their gamers independently.","Nintendo: Hey! Listen.!\r Yes, like Navi... the fairy.\r Your one Switch rule is more much annoying than Navi. The multiplayer restrictions are -- nearly -- equally annoying. Exploiting your passionate fan base erodes the brand.  It makes me sad. You aren't supposed to be like the other guys!","You need to pay at least 200 dollars (for a switch lite) just to have an individual island between people, unacceptable.","I think people are misunderstanding, most players aren't angry over the single island per system; but the fact that players 2-8 have literally 0 impact on the island.\r On new leaf, pretty much all the mayor can do is add buildings or ordinances. that's it. this game excludes a large chunk out of it for the other players. i.e: terraformation.\r If you're playing single player, then good for you! but stop taking other people words and distorting them.","I\u2019ve been a fan since the original GameCube version and this reminded me of why I loved Animal Crossing so much. It was so much fun to build up my own island from scratch, have everything exactly where I want and I feel like there\u2019s endless things for me to do. It had me wanting to explore and try everything and it was so visually beautiful to look at. I can see being lost in this for the next long while. Zero regrets purchasing and blew my expectations out of the water!","Not only is the game limited to one island per console, but no player other than the person who started the game first is able to progress the game at all. They can't contribute resources to building, they don't unlock things naturally as the game progresses, and they have no accomplishments they can achieve.\r Many people giving positive reviews argue that it's fine because \"its always been this way\" and that really isn't true. No AC game before this one has limited you to one town per console. If I could buy a second copy of the game and get the option to enjoy it as much as my wife is, then I might be okay with it. But the only option would be to spend hundreds of dollars and buy a second console, if I could even find one in stock right now.","I hate to say it but this is ridiculous: being unable to progress in the game if you're not the Resident Representative is frankly unacceptable for a game that so strongly encourages sharing and mutual enjoyment. On top of the restrictions this puts on households with only 1 copy of the game, you're also restricted to 1 island *per console*.\r If you're playing alone and are the sole user of your console, go nuts! 10/10. If you're planning on sharing? Wait and see...\rI will gladly change or remove my review if this issue is ever resolved.","Just like every other recent reviewer giving it a negative score... Nintendo made a selfish call locking only one user to be in Control of the only island. This is unacceptable of a family oriented platform. So for Evey family that has multiple kids or users, each one would have to own their own switch in order to have their own island and gather their own resources. What a scam. Before writing this review I gave Nintendo a 1/10 but now I'm all fired up thinking of how much a of a cash grab this is it gets a big 0/10. Good job Nintendo.","Got the game for my partner and I to enjoy in quarantine and am heartbroken over the restrictions placed on the second player. Sharing one island is fine and cool but additional players not following the same progression and not having access to all the game\u2019s mechanics is TERRIBLE.This has to be fixed.","I have 4 young kids and they are very good about sharing the switch we have, and they were excited about animal crossing coming out.. I like the switch's ability to have separate saves per account so that each kid can go through the games on their own..\rWe pre-ordered animal crossing and were excited about its release.. Well, come to find out, you can only have a single island *per switch*!! The island is shared by all the accounts! And further more, only the creator of the island can advance the plot or do any major stuff!\rThe kids are majorly disappointed, and it's not like i can buy 4 more switches for all 5 of us just for one game! This just ruins the entire game from the start, and there is no good reason not to have an island per account instead of per switch.. Even if we hypothetically bought 5 copies of the game, it would still only let you play one single island.. The only solution would be for me to buy 4 more switches, which is insane.. Please fix this nintendo!!","Only one island per console??? My mum and I used to play Animal Crossing new leaf when I was a kid both having our seperate worlds where we could do what we want. But now my mum is delegated to a secondary role because I'm player 1. That so unfair! We both want to play our own worlds! Why is it so hard to make seperate islands for each account????? Nintendo did this purposefully. I hope their greedy cash-snatching arses are happy and content with their choice to do this. DO THEY NOT KNOW that most familes can't afford to buy another expensive switch????? Far out, they sit in their ivory towers not knowing what it's like to be a normal goddamn family trying to make ends meet. Such a simple design choice to make when making animal crossing NH, yet this simple decision causes so much goddamn suffering. Gonna go REFUND this stupid game, I don't want to be part of this PARASITIC CORPORATE BEHAVIOUR","I\u2019ll update this score if they allow multiple people on the same console to have equal responsibilities. I am giving it a low score because of the same issues that other reviewers  have mentioned (lack of multiple islands per console, lack of co-op controls, restrictions of \u201cplayer 2\u201d abilities.) these are unnecessary gameplay issues that could be fixed. Despite the potential of this game, I want to see change. Nintendo please listen to the users this time, I would love to have a better at home experience with this game with my partner.","Only one player per console can truly experience this game. If you\u2019re thinking of buying it as a couple to run an island together, don\u2019t. Only one of you will get to make the decisions. While you can always communicate this outside the game, you can\u2019t even help contribute in game. If you aren\u2019t the \u201cisland representative\u201d you are treated no differently to other NPCs.","Il gioco \u00e8 fantastico, ma se condividete la consolle con qualcun'altro diventa terribile! Solo il primo giocatore potr\u00e0 godersi il gioco, tutti gli altri saranno costretti a dipendere da lui: non si pu\u00f2 costruire, gli strumenti non si possono sbloccare e tante altre limitazioni assurde! Non si capisce perch\u00e9 Nintendo non abbia volute dare la possibilit\u00e0 di creare diverse isole su una consolle. E attenzione, \u00e8 inutile comprare pi\u00f9 di un gioco, il salvataggio sar\u00e0 sempre lo stesso. Quindi se volete godervi una buona esperienza dovete comprare tante consolle!","I was super excited for this game... and then find out it\u2019s a single shared island for everyone on the switch. My husband has pretty bad anxiety, and wouldn\u2019t touch anything because he was afraid to mess something up. Definitely a no from me.","Can\u2019t have more than one island on the console? Great when my girlfriend and me both want separate islands. Literally unplayable for one of us.","Exactly what I expected from an animal crossing game. Great atmosphere and gameplay. The controls are intuitive and the game just works.","Wonderful game, my first Animal Crossing. Nintedo Switch graphics are stunning. A lot like Stardew Valley, but more Nook! However, please let me pick up multiple items at once!","I absolutely love this game; however, both me and my brother would like to have our own islands but this is not possible without the purchase of another switch. This is extremely disappointing as Nintendo intentionally did this; they could have just done the save files similar to games like BOTW or SMO, but they didn't. So, despite this being one of my favorite games this year; I feel Nintendo made a poor decision in forcing players to buy multiple switches to have multiple islands.","This game feels like it's trying to force homes to buy multiple Switches rather than letting separate accounts use one Switch to experience separate game play. No other game is set up like this. It also restricts content so rather than letting a person binge play, it encourages you to frequently check in on a regular basis.","Coming from Animal Crossing New Leaf, a portable wonder of its time, this sequel excuse is pretty sloppy for the platform it's coming out on.\rEmpty in content and in-game activities are very repetitive and mundane.\rInstead, the only redeemable are the different ways to customize your character, but nothing else.\r If it had come out in 3DS it would not bother me as much, but as a game of 60 dollars it is a total scam.","One island per console ruined the weekend for my family. wife and son are upset that they are not full-fledged players.why for a full gaming experience, I need to buy a console + game for each member of the family. Is it family frendly?","Just like others have mentioned on how Trashtendo wants you to buy more than one system. Its sick how greedy and how they've became as a company they are the worst. And people keeps supporting and buying their expensive garbage? WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?\r I remember when I never understood how they could get away with selling Handheld systems without a charger and I still cant understand how that was possible and people were OK with it. Also their discounts are the worse their games are so expensive. They sell you a 6years old game for 50-60$ in the Shop. They think their games are something from heaven. PLEASE Trashtendo go to hell.","Devastating. I bought this for my boys, and our family of 5 was excited to play! Guess what? 1 island per Switch. BROKEN. I went to give artifacts to the owl and I couldnt hear the delightful descriptions because one of my boys had already completed all the requests for unique objects. Nintendo needs to fix this. Requiring 1 switch per player is BROKEN. I don't think I have ever been this angry with a company before. I am willing to buy 5 copies of Animal Crossing, but not 5 Switches. What a horrible launch experience for a game that we have been dreaming about for years.","Best AC game ever. It combines all i\u00b4ve loved of previous games and added new features that makes this game so much enjoyable.","I honestly think this game was incredibly well made and was excited to delve further into it. Unfortunately, I live in a household with multiple people and only one Switch and the game only allows 1 island per Switch console. Furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards (naming the town, doing initial town building quests). Additionally the game does not account for multiple people being on the island and always generates the same amount of resources per day, meaning anyone that plays after someone else is liable to not find any wood, stone or fruit until the next literal day of the week. All of this combines to make the local multiplayer experience terrible. All other games on the switch allow for different user profiles to create new save files, why is this not the case for Animal Crossing? On Gamecube I was able to buy another memory card to create another town, for New Horizons I would have to buy a completely new Switch and copy of the game to have another island. Do not buy this game if you have brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, dogs or grandparents interested in playing it, unless of course you're somehow not affected by the global pandemic and can drop another 500 dollars so you can both play happily.","As a \"player 2\", Nintendo has essentially told me that I can't ever play properly on the game that I share. In theory, sharing an island works, and many games have succeeded in this. The resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do, the fact that it doesn't literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share a switch because one player will perform all of the activities, filling their NookMiles, leaving nothing left for anyone else to do. Sharing an island at all should be a choice, and the game itself should be designed around sharing, with safeguards allowing every player to fully enjoy the game. At present this is far from the case and it leaves an extremely poor play experience for \"player 2's\" and even Players 1's to a certain extent. Unless this is changed, the game is worthless to me and many others, therefore I can't give any score other than 0.\r And to anyone saying that people giving negative reviews over a single, \"minor\" feature/complaint, and are trying to counterbalance the score to \"drown out the whiners\", remember that the people reviewing these low scores literally cannot experience the game that you are giving 10's for because of this problem.","This is easily without a doubt the best game in the series! It adds so many small features and the music is super chill.","Two people on one Switch? Only one of you gets to make big decisions and actually experience the whole game because you can only have one island per system! Want to play co-op, because playing individually and not getting the full experience would suck? Nope! The followers barely have any functionality. So now no one in my house wants to play and take it away from each other, and I can't refund it because of the Nintendo Eshop policy. I would be happy to update my review if changes are made","Terrible value for $360. Why $360 and not $60? Because the game is effectively good for one person per console, so if you expect to get the full experience of the game (which I'm sure you do), you'll need to buy one Switch per player. Yup, one Switch per player. For some god awful reason, Nintendo decided it was reasonable to ship the game in a state where only user per Switch gets to play the full game.\r Don't want to shell out $300 for another Switch per player? Then you can look forward to being constantly gated by the primary player's progress at every turn, having zero role in building out your island and its residents, missing all the major story moments (unless you use the equally awful local coop mode, more on that below), and having to buy all the tools and recipes the primary player gets for free.\r Planning on only playing together using local coop? That helps with not missing out on the story beats, but expect all but the \"leader\" player to be little more than a glorified spectator. \"Follower\" players cannot talk to villagers, access their inventory, pick things up without a long animation for each item, choose where to go, enter/exit buildings, use the tool belt, and worst of all: only the leader will receive any of the quest rewards or world drops.\r The game still gets a two star from as I'm sure playing as the primary or sole player is still very fun. To anyone like me who was looking forward to playing this on a shared console: Be warned, you're getting a fraction of the content.","Sharing the game I am basically *shadowing* player 1, I am only a guest in someone's island and this is ridiculous because I also paid for this game!\rI cannot trigger any events no matter how many hours I play it, I will never go beyond what is achieved by the player 1; and I have to pay for everything that player 1 gets for free!\rNO ONE told us about this before buying this game ! we only knew that we have to share an island, which I thought is weird but manageable if you are smart about using the resources. And according to Nintendo it is supposed to be \"up to 8 persons multiplayer game\". Well it is not!! and i want a refund.","More of the same great, relaxing, easy going progression that we\u2019ve come to expect from the series. I do wish we had the ability to create more than one island per switch but it\u2019s FAR from the tragic scenario that other reviewers are making it out to be.Update:  After playing through quite a few more hours, the family is thoroughly irritated at the fact that our 6 year old is the kid with the dominant profile which is limiting all of our progression. Nintendo, this has to be patched so we can populate different islands with multiple profiles using a single Switch.","Honestly the game is amazing, while i understand that the one island per console might bother some people, if you play couch coop can be a blast, there's also tons of trolls review-bombing the game instead of doing fair criticism also, but is hard to deny that it is the best Animal Crossing by far.","Incredible game. It's definitely a must buy for anyone who enjoys creativity, relaxation, and just carefree fun. It's definitely slow and low-stakes, so if you lack patience and an imagination, go play some looter shooter or something. If you put time and work into this game, it will pay off, and the feeling of accomplishment you have when you end up with a beautiful island is amazing. 10/10","The trolls who would try and bomb this game's rating can go back to Fortnite and continue to offer nothing of value to the world. The game holds true to the series, requires a little extra effort to get the game up to speed than previous titles but it goes well with the current quarantine.","I've been playing animal crossing since the GameCube and this is the best one, NO QUESTION.","Really a fun game.  The people posting 0/10 because they can't have their own island are just pitching a hissyfit.","The game looks good.\rToo bad I can't actually play it: only the first player logging in gets the full experience. As player 2 you are stuck behind player 1 progression and do not get to do as much as him.\rA pity and a shame for Nintendo.\rReally frustrated and disappointed.","Would be great if nintendo actually put effort into online multilayer they really dropped the ball","It's pretty fun. The multiplayer is lack luster but otherwise is an amazing game so far.","this game is a solid 8 or 9, the one island per console thing does suck, but so does **** review bombing so it gets a 10 from me to help offset the angry basement dwellers","Its my 1st AC...maybe im too old for this...but...its a great waste of my time...millions will love playin it...its a highly polished nintendo IP...let the haters be haters...doesnt change the fact that every honest reviewer has to give atleast a 8/10...i will have fun with AC for a long time","Addictive and fun but a serious drawback is the 1 island limit, just disappointing to see at this point.","El juego est\u00e1 bien, pero lo que me molest\u00f3 bastante es que solo sea una isla por persona. Esto limita mucho la cantidad de cosas que podes hacer antes de que se renueve el ciclo.","If you\u2019re not the primary profile the game is stripped-down \u201clite\u201d version of itself.","Fix the game Nintendo. I bought it for me and my wife to enjoy i started the game first only to find out we have to share a single island. Annoying but no big deal. However, I then discovered that my wife cannot make any progress in the game on her own and make and executive decisions. I was cheated out of $60 and I am pissed. Fix it","A great addition to the Animal Crossing game franchise. It\u2019s very upsetting to see people give the game a zero because you can\u2019t have your own island when sharing a switch. While I get this frustration I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ploy for Nintendo to sell more switches. They\u2019ve sold many already and previous animal crossing games have had this format. I don\u2019t like it much either, but I\u2019m the only one that uses my switch so I\u2019m not affected. Also, seeing people say that this game has no direct story line....have you never played an animal crossing game? ","Some of you have never played an Animal Crossing game and it shows. This game is great. It improves upon almost every aspect of the game. So sad that some of you feel the need to throw an online tantrum because you didn\u2019t research the game before buying. To everyone else, buy this game! You\u2019ll have loads of fun!","The games fantastic! To all the people complaining about the 1 island per switch, if you were paying at least .1% of attention you would have known that, cause that was told to us multiple times i repeat multiple times! Also maybe do some research before buying the game maybe? You certainly have time to write a trash review!","Perfect game for the weird times we are in. Beautiful, and filled to the brim with what AC fans would want.","An excellent addition to the series! New Horizons expands on the tried and true formula of laid back task management and town expansion by adding a simple yet deep crafting component, and then allowing players to apply this to the island as a whole!For those new to the game, yes it revolves around you paying off your debt to a capitalist raccoon, but the tasks you undertake to reach that frankly easy goal are fishing, catching bugs and more, things that play well into the concept of something relaxing.While the restriction of one island to console is interesting, I believe it was a choice made to tie it into the other games which have had the same gesture to allow for people to work together on the same island and grow it as a group, while also limiting play time so that one can experience other things. While that may not be everyone's cup of tea, the game was designed by someone who enjoyed these game activities in real life, so perhaps one should take a page out of the creator's book and try them in real life!","I'm sure if I was the 1st person on the island my review would be better, but as the second one all of my ability to progress is gated by my girlfriend.  Unless you're the first profile to log in, the game is pretty busted and quite boring.\r Unless you live alone, I'd strongly recommend sitting this one out until they fix this issue in a patch, if at all.","Now the whole cant make a second town is weird but thats how the gamecube one was and ds one but you could buy memory cards on gcn for cheeper my problem is I cant change the time of day im a secupond shifter and I cant use nooks and crannies ever for full pricw or buy shot becuase my job keeps me to late  at first you could sell to tommy in the tent all  ight but once you upgrade say bye bye to doing anything at night","What is your problem gamers? It's not supposed to be a game of criticism but a game of coming together. If you dont like how one person decorates your island you work on a compromise. It is a mighty fine game with excellent music that proves that if it isnt broken dont break it. It's the players that need to get their act straight","Fantastic,  I can't stop playing. It gives hours of pure fun. So much activities, infinity islands to explore, this game is so much worth it.","Tiempos de carga son lentisimos para un juego con graficas inferiores a los de hoy en dia en juegos en un smarphone, lo compre y lo jugue 3 dias ahora quedara tirado por buen rato mucho hype pesima compra","Completely unacceptable to restrict the multiplayer to one island per switch and only allow the main resident to progress the game. How can Nintendo market itself as the \u201cfamily\u201d gaming console and make a decision that is such a slap in the face to families? Do you know frustrating it is for parents with multiple kids? I could MAYBE excuse the money grab if you had to purchase additional islands as an add on but this is just a disgusting attempt to sell more switch lites. So angry and disappointed.","The island save state situation is un acceptable. The game also is really slow at the start even for an animal crossing.","A decent addition to the franchise marred by unfortunate and needless limitations in order to sell more Switch consoles. This will backfire on Nintendo, probably cost nintendo more money in the long run as will the mediocre pokemon games.\r I cannot see Nintendo continuing to sell mediocre or flawed products moving forward, especially when better options exist. (TamTam, StarDew Valley)","Its a lovely single player game with great writing however the multiplayer aspect is just a mess. Absolute mess. It is poorly explained what you can and cant do as a non-primary resident or visitor and you cant do a lot!\r So Single player only give it an 8.","For extremely anti-consumer and immoral practices this company should be sued for huge billions of dollars.","GET RID OF THE BUNNY EVENT!\r Seriously this stupid event was for fun for an hour but now I can't catch fish and the sky is constantly full of useless eggs so I have to ignore the ballons and miss the ones that actually give you useful loot or I have to pull my slingshot out every 2 seconds to figure out if it's a useless balloon or one I actually want to go for. I can't get enough wood or stone items because half to 2/3 of them turn into those stupid flipping eggs. I can't get enough fossils for the same reason\r This event has ruined my favourite parts of animal crossing.\r I am no longer enjoying myself","I purchased this game for me and my wife to share. I was hoping we could each have our own islands, but apparently we're forced to share one. What's worst, since she played first she gets all the crafting recipes and storyline choices, and I've been demoted to a second class citizen. I really wanted to enjoy this animal crossing game but we both can't have our own game on one console and now I can't get crafting recipes for certain things like bridges, NPC buildings, or contribute in any way to our town other than collecting resources and giving them to her.\r Nintendo has given this game a massive design flaw and I'm honestly really disappointed with how it turned out.","Another money-grubbing time-wasting game from Nintendo. I'm sure the brain dead fans will still enjoy it somehow.","These negative reviews are insane. This is easily one of the greatest games released for the switch to date. Playable hours will easily match and exceed games like BOTW","Nunca me hab\u00eda comprado alg\u00fan animal crossing y ahora con este que me cost\u00f3 encontrarlo f\u00edsico por el virus en Coronado XD. Me a gusta bastante, es hora del s\u00faper farmeo, bien tranquilo y ya me voy porqu\u00e9 seguir\u00e9 con este juego","The game is beautiful and very charming, but the fact that you can only have one single island per console is totally ruining the experience for us at home. The three of us (kid, wife and me) were so looking forward to this game, only to be terribly disappointed to find that only the creator of the island can progress through the story of the game.\r Worst of all, a new copy of the game won't fix this problem, only buying another Nintendo Switch console (two new consoles in our case to be precise) would do, this is absolutely crazy in 2020. Please Nintendo fix this nonsense.","I was going to rate this a solid 8 but people are being fat basement nerd ragers and review bombing a game for no real reason again (I certainly don't see any microtransactions at least) people need to stop review bombing every tiny insignificant little thing otherwise no one is going to pay attention to them anymoreIt's a great animal crossing game. If you enjoy the previous games than this is better.","This is a game for people who love doing chores. In addition to crafting your own tools that break after 20 uses you also have to craft all the stores and the other villagers houses as well.","Seems like people are hating on a Nintendo exclusive game again. This is the perfect game of you just want to vibe. Sure, you have to put in a little time before you can fully experience the game, but I think that adds to the experience. I love this game. Not only that, but it came at the perfect time.","Un juego excelente,lleno de detalles,de cosas por hacer,algo sumamente adictivo por el cual a veces juegas horas y horas sin parar,sin duda uno de los mejores juegos de la decada,un excelente trabajo de Nintendo,me encant\u00f2.","This is an exceedingly polished, fun, soothing, creative, and deep game. It gives much of the satisfaction from growing and harvesting and collecting I got from Stardew Valley, but with a much lower challenge level, cuter graphics, and none of the anxiety. (I love Stardew Valley, so that's definitely not a knock on it)There are some convoluted and annoying issues with the multiplayer, but nothing game-breaking, and it just came out so there's potential for them to be ironed out. Text communication is clunky and slow, it's not intuitive how to visit or be visited by friends, and I don't know why I can't place items when someone is visiting my island. But again, this is a great game, and these are minor quibbles.","Although the game is fun and relaxing, I bought it purely for the multiplayer couch coop with my wife... where the game excels in single player gameplay it falls flat on its face with couch coop multiplayer... it\u2019s so painful to play together we Have resorted to taking turns playing single player... wish AC would\u2019ve gotten this right...maybe an update in the future will make it more enjoyable for families to play together...","The game is absolutely great, the only reason it has a lowish score is because the multiplayer is a little bad, but if one thing is wrong with a beautiful game it doesn't  mean it deserves a score of 0.","If you like animal crossing, get it. if you think you might like it, you will","This game is honestly the best Animal Crossing game ever made and I've been playing since the Gamecube. Yes the multiplayer is a little lackluster but you all should just be glad it's even there! As far as I know all the other Animal Crossing games were single player. If you are a big Animal Crossing fan you'll love this game.","This game is so good it got my wife excited to play it. I had to go buy her a switch but hey, I\u2019ve wanted her to have her own for a while.","10/10 the BEST Animal Crossing game so far. Even with the one island per switch, there's so much to do and it is so gorgeous, it doesn't matter! The crafting gives you more to do in a day, the graphics are literally jaw-dropping, the music is soothing, the chill is palpable. Thank you Nintendo. This is the Animal Crossing we've been waiting for.","New Horizons did just that, opened up new horizons for the Animal Crossing series. The new crafting aspect was something I originally wasn't sure I was going to like but I have taken to and really enjoy. Previous titles would just have you doing tasks for your villagers and just catching bugs and fish all day long. New Leaf turned a new leaf making you the mayor of a town and setting up a beautiful location. Now you've got the full reign of the island to make it whatever you want. Having the ability to place villager homes so they don't ruin your flower garden or paths? YES PLEASE! Being able to terraform the land/water scape to make it flow however you want and fill in weird gaps of the map? I'll take it! There's so much to this game that is absolutely amazing and a labor of love from Nintendo.\r Socially it does require Nintendo Online to visit your friends. That's pretty common at this point for most game titles for any platform. I find having one island per switch to be amazing. You can share your game cartridge and not worry about someone destroying your hard work when you get it back.\r My boyfriend and I do have our own switches so it makes playing easy but I would want to get another game so I don't have to wait for him when I think of a new task for myself. Overall, this is a much needed island vacation!","I'm a newbie to animal crossing. This is the first one I've ever played. I had a few close friends recommend the series to me and oh boy! I'm regretting not getting it sooner! I find it so relaxing and addictive. If you need to escape from things for a bit, then this game is definitely for you.","#EpicWin This game is everything we love about the franchise and much more.","I'm a long time fan of the Animal Crossing series and this is by far my favorite! The crafting system is awesome and the ability to have 8 players on a single island is awesome. It seems a lot of people don't get the community aspect of this series, and want to complain about the single island per console deal. I can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save without loosing your original, but to complain that you and your wife cant have seperate islands, really misses the point of this long standing series. Why wouldnt you want to share an island with your wife or kids ...thats the point. Everyone gets to participate together, to create an awesome island that can be built over, literally, years. My wife and I work together to create a happy and healthy community. You can terraform the terrain, craft new items, work together to populate the museum, and more! This is a community building game. The only improvment I would have liked is for everyone in a multiplayer session to have imidiate access to their items without having to switch leaders. The fact you can only have one Island per system isnt a deal breaker, at all. People want to think that Nintendo did this solely for the purposes of selling more Switches, but the way I see it, this is more of a system built to prevent exploiting the game. As I recall, the only game that didnt limit the number of islands per console was the original, and that worked cuz the online capabilitiesof the game cube were very limited. Even the Ds games worked like this. And sure, it would have been cool if they could have solved this in a different way...but the switch doesnt save to the game cartridge, they are read only memory cards. So your island MUST be tied to your internal storage of the Switch. If everyone could make multiple islands, then the game would be very exploitable. I wish that Nintendo could have solved this problem while still allowing multiple islands, or at least one Island per account, but then anyone could make multiple accounts and create. But in New Leaf, i didnt see nearly as much hate for the fact that you had to buy the game twice to make a new file. And like I said, Switch carts are read only, so the game save has to be tied to the console. They could have done cloud storage, but that would mean any user without a subscription is locked out of the game. If Ni te di really wanted to milk their customers, they would ha e provided all the tools and recipies and exclusive tools and recipes, for purchase online. But no. You get the whole game and never have to pay another cent to enjoy it.","A near perfect implementation of a classic series! This is an early review but so far the game has everything you've come to love in the series with new features added to help keep you engaged in the game.Quality of life improvements were implemented such as icons notifying you if an item has been donated to the museum already though I do wish that feature was extended to all items in general to make it easier to determine what you already have in your catalog. One common complaint I hear echoed is the fact that you can only have one island per system/cartridge but that is only a minor issue, especially with the lower cost of a Switch Lite. One wouldn't expect to share one cartridge and one 3ds and have multiple towns with New Leaf, so this expectation for the Nintendo Switch is pretty entitled. My wife and I as well as our two children play happily on our own consoles and enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game, though I do hope to be surprised eventually to find minigames like Tortimer Island had.","Love this game. It is pretty different from the previous titles but I think it is quite refreshing.","My girlfriend and I place this together and it is awesome!! You have 1 island but as long as you play on different profiles, multiple ppl can live on the same island and there is no reason you can't progress and build on each profile. We can even play together at the same time! But usually one of us will play at a time and progress and build our homes into bigger houses.\r This game was worth every penny and for true animal crossing fans, it's everything you missed and wanted from the original!\r I've been playing this for hrs since I got it and it is not slowing down. We are constantly trying to build our houses,get better furniture and such,get new items and tools, catch different kinds of fish and bugs etc., build our island too look better and build a better shop. And I still haven't gotten to the 2nd half of the island! Able to visit friends islands, visit random default islands, customize your character, transfer items from pocket camp! Worth it! My girlfriend is playing right now!","Y'all obviously Never played animal crossing it's always been one village per island..now you have an option to go to other islands to get supplies... this is one of the most polished of the series ...if every person got their way animal crossing would be like every other farming game...good job Nintendo ! Suck it y'all spoiled haters","Animal Crossing is a fun and Relaxing game. My wife and I have enjoyed playinh it together and apart. It's always fun to meet quirky neighbors or to  go and explore the world.","This game is fantastic, and the memory limitations don't even mater that much.","If you have multiple people in your household you need more than one switch to play as it's 1 world per system....","I had never played AC before and got it for my girlfriend so she could play it on our Switch because she loved playing New Leaf. After she stopped playing for the day I was gonna hop on and create my own island but that's when I learned that it was not possible. There is only one island per Switch console, not per user profile. Even if you do go ahead and use the same island you are completely gutted of what you can do as the second player. I could've been an Animal Crossing fan but instead I've been alienated. I wanted to have my own island and have my own experience. A pretty disappointing flaw that only seems like a cash grab from Nintendo.","I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. I'm not too fussed about the one island per switch thing. It keeps the game true to it's original. I remember when you could only have one house per game, and only four players.  Such an improvement; now we can have 8 players and 8 houses? Awesome!  Looking forward to the seasonal events and setting up my little village","First time playing animal crossing.  Loving every minute locked inside the house, 10 out of 10 no mistake. No issues with multi player","The product shipped broken. Starting the game with a different family member will load the save file of the person who started the game for the first time. This problem doesn't exist with other games on my Switch. I don't believe this issue will be fixed any faster than the Mario Maker's multiplayer problem (which still exist). I will update this review if things improve.If the game worked, it would be a fantastic game to get the family during this whole quarentine event.","I tried to play a game as a second play on the Switch and I realized that nothing left to do for me. My gf shook every trees, collected every rocks, built everything, and after 10 minutes, I couldn't do anything. I just roaming around without an axe or any other tool. What can I say, excellent experience...","Llevo jugando a Animal Crossing desde Gamecube y \u00e9ste seguramente sea el mejor de la saga.

Brav\u00edsimo.","This may be one of the cutest and most light hearted games I ever played... Or to be precise: I ever tried to play, because I was only the second person on my Switch to start the game. I've never played AC before and through: \"Well... This is quite boring.\" Until I learned no, its not, its only because my Girlfriend started it first. If there is more than one person who wanrs to play this game: DO NOT BUY IT!","This game is excellent, lots of these bad reviews are not accurate. Multi player is amazingly fun, but yes does require a second switch. (Not unlike how gameboys have always been....) the game doesnt box you in with \"quests\", help build up your own island community, decorate where ever you want! Ignore the bad reviews.","I created a metacritic account just so I could rant about this game...the island sharing is stupid. I play a lot faster than my sister and so she isn't getting to do as much of the stuff as I am and she is angry about it. Will Nintendo fix it? I kinda doubt it... And anyways the damage is already done.","Love the game! People should stop whining about one island per switch and learn to share and team play instead. While there are some minor minuses (loading time when travel or no split screen in multiplayer), this game is still an amazing update and makes it the best game in the series!","Effort was definitely made on this game. I can tell that there are different types of things to do in game. However I almost guarantee that I will never get there. For now, I really like the game. For now. Multiplayer is awful, I bought it so my wife and I could enjoy something fun and it turns out that second player is just one person as the leader and the other follows them around pretty much unable to do anything but pick stuff up. Pointless and not worth setting up in the first place. As far as online goes I won't even bother trying it. Having 8 people able to draw off of my already dismal material sources at anytime just isn't feasible. Iron nuggets are hyper rare at best. I get one on average for every two days I play. I think the idea behind this is to encourage online play.\r At first I was super excited, this is a new and unique concept to me. I don't predict I am going to care enough about it to play more than a week or so. I have a situation in which I need a tiny number of iron nuggets and at the pace I'm going I'll have flat gotten tired of trying. You can spend certain currency to go to vacant islands and take supplies, but you will only get so much of that currency so if you don't think before you spend you will find yourself in short supply and only able to get a bit every day.\r The whole game appears to be geared towards tiny amounts of play time. At an hour every day I have ran all but the most common resources out. Even weeds no longer spawn on the parts of the island I can reach. If I have two inventories of high value items to sell, the second inventory (And so on) always seems to sell for substantially less which means it becomes annoying trying to grind for money.\r Tools that last require resources that I can't afford to spare if I want to progress the game, so I am currently unable to craft them. This was a terrible oversight at best. I've resorted to making cheap tools over and over again and have ultimately found they are more cost efficient in the long run.\r I can't recommend this game. I will continue to hang in there and update my review for as long as I can hold my attention on the game but again I doubt I'll even still keep it downloaded on my switch past a week or two.\r Don't buy it.","Only 1 island per switch.I've never seen something so greedy from a company. This even beats EA. I'm so disappointed. Nintendo sucks!","One island per Switch is an incomprehensibly bad decision. Zeros stars for what would otherwise have been an enjoyable game.","$60 is a lot of money to spend for only one person to be able to have a well-rounded experience on a video game. I have two sisters who also were excited to play the game, but despite them BOTH having their own Nintendo accounts and online accounts too, they were booted up onto my island with not much to do. I considered even buying them their own copies of the game, but upon further investigation that isn\u2019t enough to allow them to play their own game. So if we all wanted to have our own islands, we would each need to buy our own Switch and copies of the game. This is so ridiculous, it seriously ruined the experience of the game for me (and obviously my sisters too). Not about to drop $600+ just for us to play a game together, I can\u2019t believe Nintendo set it up like this. Isn\u2019t it enough to have bought one system (already $300, a decent chunk of money), each of us to be paying for our own Online subscriptions, and to have gotten the $60 game disc? They need to fix this ASAP.I do like the game, but like I said, it\u2019s hard to enjoy when I live with two other people who also wanted to be able to play.","Hey, first time Reviewer. I know that's gonna auto-discount my review in some eyes, but I've just never been insulted by a game enough that I felt the need to actually make an account and warn people.

You can even live there with your whole family!* (If you don't mind anyone besides the first resident being treated like glorified visitors with a house.)\r Oh but only one island per switch guys because... we want everyone to buy their own switch. (in a global recession because the average family has tons of excess money right now, and definitely aren't all living way below the poverty line. Greetings from America!)\r Here is what they don't tell you:\r1. Only the first resident can advance the main plot points, and unlock those features they lured you in with. If you aren't first resident, you won't even be able to see the recipe's for the objects/furniture you'll be forced to craft, in order to advance the plot.\r2. You have to build everything on this island for everyone one. Don't invite people to live there cause it's gonna be you grinding all day e'ery day for the resources. Not really the Island vacation package it was sold as.\r3. there is Inconvenience baked into the game. Half of the upgrades just get rid of some annoying inconvenience that you were just putting up with. Advance the plot (if you are first resident) to have a slightly less miserable time. I think that's a really lazy and corrupt form of game progression, used only by those that lack the imagination necessary to offer genuinely fulfilling progression rewards. I'ts like hide and seek but you get to remove your blindfold after thirty games (or something.)\r Also ignore any excuse that these annoyances are in the game to ensure fairness, because there are already many money exploits in the game. So in the end it's kinda like the Games for Windows Live disaster of yore. You know, that time when Microsoft thought it was cool to sabotage the stability and enjoyment of their games in the hopes of preventing piracy, which happened anyways.  Hamstringing your product to preserve \"fairness\" is a fools errand. you might as well ask the sun not to rise.\r So the main issue is, if you buy this game you are telling Nintendo that this is an okay business model. \"Naw it's cool, us consumers are total suckers. Hey if another Zelda game comes out make sure that only the first person on the console to play the game can advance the plot. so you can force us to buy more switches.\"\r Other than all that total BS, it had some pretty enjoyable aspects. For one, you don't need to take a freaking personality test to change your hair color. (These developers are asinine.) And everything was pretty much 24/7 until we made progress. (then it went back to their traditional stance of, **** night owls.\") But as soon as I found out the game was just gonna treat me like a chump indefinitely, like unpaid labor, it kinda drained any aspect of \"working for fun\" from the game.","Hugely disappointed. We were super excited for this to come out. My husband downloaded it so he was the first to play. I got on later and I had to be on his island. Bummer... Well now I can't do the quests he's able to do. He works third shift so he doesn't play as much as I do. Please fix this!!","Absolute **** I wouldnt buy this game ever. It is trash and anyone who buys it is trash","Apparently a problem that was already here in New leaf is such a big deal that people are giving one-star reviews, imagine that... While it's true that having only one island is kind of disappointing, the whole game experience, combined with how far these series have come, make this game an absolute pleasure to play. Nintendo has really gone out of its way to develop new mechanics and make it an original and new exciting experience.\rI swear to god sometimes crybaby fanboys are the absolute worst.","C\u2019est un jeu complet, relaxant, et beau... une version bien finie bref un tr\u00e8s bon jeu ","It's the best entry in the series so far! I've been looking forward to it since it got announced, and it really exceeded my expectations.","I love this game, it's so relaxing and distracting which is great, especially in times like these.","I love the game so far, it's a great experience and nice to have to relax to and just calm down after (in my case) really dumb homework. I'm the only one who uses my switch so I dont mind the crappy online, nintendo always has awful online/co op","I\u2019m a huge fan of AC. This game is no exception. That being said, my biggest fault with this game is that I\u2019m the 2nd player. I can not do anything unless player 1 progresses in the game or I just fork out $300 for another switch and I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not buying a 2nd switch just to be able to progress in the game. Not happening! I believe if they allow individual players to have their own island, this would solve most negative reviews. You could allow all players to make choices, but then you run the risk of players unable to enjoy the full experience of the game as players would start arguing when someone places something in an area they didn\u2019t want it to go. I get that this would open up the possibility for people to cheat and create multiple accounts and have multiple islands, which seems to be the likeliest of reasons when I searched why this wasn\u2019t a feature already. The only issue with that is, people always find ways to cheat and if they do than that hinders their experience and it\u2019s their choice so why alter our experience to keep them from doing something they are probably already doing anyway? Please fix this issue, I\u2019d really like to enjoy all this game has to offer as I did so in the past with all your other games!!!!","Nos lo compremos mi pareja y yo y nos decepcionamos al ver que no podemos crear una isla cada uno ni que el segundo personaje pueda hacer misiones.","As somebody who actually plays the game with 2 players on one console instead of just complaining about it. I actually like this feature, it gives us a lot more interaction with each other. After reading some of the reviews I've seen a lot of misinformation about the 1 island rule. My point is don't trust these 1 or 0 ratings who haven't even given the game a chance or even touched the game.","The game is lovely. It is adorable when it can be, and frustrating when it has to be (I'm looking at you, fishes). Some game improvements make the experience much better than the games before it and some fixes need to be made like crafting items in stacks and buying multiple items at once in some sort of catalogue type of system like in Dragons Dogma.\r However, there is one major issue that will result in a protest rating of 1 until it gets resolved and that is the 1-island-per-switch rule. The irony that a family console with a game about family is tearing families apart because of the restriction is baffling. The greed that Nintendo has shown recently is making it so that their image is heavily tarnished. You have YouTubers calling it out, you have review sites calling it out, you have gamers on Metacritic calling it out. There is no winning out of this and if they would like to see the rating of the game that is deserving of an 8 or higher they need to address the issue and either release a patch that makes it so separate accounts can have different islands, or succumb to the fall of the rating of the game they worked hard on.\r Make your choice, Nintendo. There is only one way you can win this and ignoring it will ensure that you lose.","Really Nintendo? You have allowed the switch to hold several accounts. You promoted switch as a family console, and you decide to restrict one island per switch? Just like how a new save file can happen in pokemon per account...Why could you not do that for animal crossing? This is corporate greed....","I'll chance my rating if they ever fix the one island/player 2 issues Nintendo should be ashamed of what they pulled here","This is my first user review of any game on MC.I specifically created an account to rate this thinly-veiled, cash grabbing, steaming pile of feces a big fat 0 for the sole reason of one island per switch.It is absolutely ludicrous that you cannot create an island per profile and expect us to fork out for another 2,3,4? Consoles if you live in a household where more than one person wants their own experience.What an absolutely piss poor design by Nintendo.","I bought this game for my daughter and I to play. I've been a long time Animal Crossing player, and I got her started on the franchise as soon as she was old enough to play. We had both been anticipating the game for months. I let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before I logged into my switch profile and started my game. I was extremely disappointed to see that it put me on my daughter's island, and I can participate as a glorified visitor. I cannot progress the game in any way. If she collects all the fruit before me for the day, I cannot gather any. As a secondary player, you can basically decorate a house, and interact with the environment, but nothing further. I understand that even if you buy another came card, you cannot have your own island. The only way to do that is to spend $200-$300 for an additional Switch console. And another $60 for a second game copy if you want to play together or at the same time. Seems like a big money grab from Nintendo to sell more Switch consoles. Extremely disappointed!","Only one island per switch AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","Bought this game for me and my girlfriend to both play. The 'one island per switch' rule is dumbfounding. For a series that's supposed to be all about creativity and exploration, this unnecessary decision completely undermines that as we are both limited to one tiny island.However what's really annoying is that my girlfriend is the primary resident so she gets to do all the fun stuff whereas all I can do is harvest resources. None of the NPCs really care about me at all, I have nothing to do to progress anything, my progress actually is hindered, and the experience generally sucks ass. Not really a \u00a350 experience in my opinion.I'm not going to buy a 2nd switch just to have my own experience. That's totally ridiclous. I'm disappointed in you nintendo as you were the last gaming company catering for families and multiplayer but this decision is stupid and just comes across as greed. There is no reason for this. I get you may be worried about resource harvesting manipulation but this is animal crossing so who cares?Cant see this having a long shelf life in my collection tbh because after the initial novelty I've realised im just left with an empty shell of a game while primary resident player 1 gets the full experience.This is fixable. Patch it and allow multiple islands per switch. I know why you didn't want to do this, but in limiting all users to one island, you limit all fun to one player and resource gathering is torturous.","I'm going to be completely honest, the game actually looks great. The graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i can tell.\r However we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all, is in fact the one island per console limit. What this means is that if you have a family household Nintendo Switch, You ALL have to share 1 island, and if you want another, you have to pay another 350$ bucks. So essentially what happens is if you have switch being shared with multiple people, new islands are behind a 350$ paywall. This is clearly Nintendo's way of stealing money out of pure greed. Please do not fall for this trap, and save your dignity.\r Now although the problem is still there, it could still be semi-fixed with a co-op run island. However this is not the case. The account who created the island practically dictates all the major decisions. Everyone else is a \"resident\" or more properly called the working class who literally does nothing other than doing what the person who created island has already completed.\r And to top it all off of this crap cake is the fact that you can't back up cloud saves, which means if something happens, that's too bad!\r If you are one person who owns the console, then congrats and feel blessed. If you're a family then do not buy this game, as it's a scam.","Bought this game for my wife's birthday to play together and I am very disappointed we can't enjoy the game as equals. I was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together. However, as the second person to join I cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location. When playing local co-op the controls for both players is reduced, upgrades like item wheel cannot be used, opening your inventory interrupts the other player's actions, like pulling out their fishing line for no reason! The secondary player is trapped in a \"little-brother mode\" where they can't even pick up items or leave the view of the leader player. Shaking the controller to swap leaders is helpful but doesn't make up for how limited this mode is.\r The game is very fun but as the second player I cannot enjoy the game fully. I hope that Nintendo will either improve local co-op by giving all switch users full island access, improving co-op controls and  adding true split screen, or worst case scrapping one island all together and giving all users their own save file.\r Expecting couples to pay at minimum $560 (2 Switches, 2 game copies, 2 online subscriptions), and even more for larger families, for each person to fully be able to experience Animal Crossing and play together is just absolutely unacceptable and needs to be fixed.","This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It dose have it's flaws but everything does so it isn't worth giving a bad rating just to try to prove something.","No s\u00e9 puede usar con varios usuarios en la misma consola, esto afecta mucho el querer compartir con alguien el juego.","Me and my sister bought this game so we could play on different islands and compare each other\u2019s islands, and obviously I was upset when I found out I couldn\u2019t have a separate island from her.Just wanted to add my voice to the crowd","Absolutely infuriating. You put out a solid game and give it GARBAGE RESTRICTIONS!!!! One island per CONSOLE? How GREEDY ARE YOU?? As if your popular system and popular game aren\u2019t enough?! You need FORCE people who want their own island in a household to have their own system? What kind of COMMUNISM IS THIS?! Trash. Upset that I purchased and already opened it.","AC would be such a perfect game if it was developed by anyone with decent brain. Calming and almost perfect single player is absolutely ruined by horrible, tragic and absolutely disgusting multiplayer made by retarded hamster. I dont even care about the fact that you cant play 2 islands on one switch but even when we bought 2 switches for me and my gf .Online is so horrible we rarely play together. If you want encourage ppl to buy one switch per person atleast make that option solve all problems.","Don't believe the haters this is a great game band me and my partner are having a great time on our shared island nearly 200 hours in","I'm a newcomer to the Animal Crossing franchise. I wanted to get into it during New Leaf but I never forced myself to buy it. After I got my Switch and saw the new one coming out I figured I'd pick it up.So far, the game is very relaxing to play. I appreciate the slow pace and happy cutesy design of the characters. I find myself wanting to build the perfect island for my friends, the characters I like and me. The major holdup I have is the confusion that comes with trying to do all of that.Some of the requirements to accomplish certain goals are obscure and hidden. Making money feels like a grind. Villagers only visit my campsite so few and far between that I wonder how long it will take me to find the perfect characters for my island. I don't know how to gain new DIY recipes to keep making my island beautiful!I won't stop playing the game for a while, but I will not be playing for hours on end like I did when I first bought it.I'll probably just start time travelling my island into the future to get things done faster. I feel like that isn't the proper way to play, but that's the way to progress when you first start anyways.","A useless game that doesn\u2019t work if you want to h e fun with your partner or family member. One island per console limits play to such a degree that it is no longer playable. Co-op is a joke and the limits they place on players they might as well just get rid of the option and just call it a single player game.","A very decent game, i don't know what the complaint of having one island per switch is all about?\r No such thing as free lunch in this world and definitely there is no such thing as buying one ticket for the whole family whenever you enter places like Disneyland. You can share the game just fine, you don't need two islands. You can share a car but remember when you pay for the car you only get one when you have only got money for the price of one.","Both me and my girlfriend wanted this game. But we would very much like an island each. Unfortunatly you can only have one island per switch! \"Hurr durr thats how it always worked\".Yeah that doesnt mean it good, and also in previous installments you just had to buy another copy of the game. Not an entirely new console.I'll refrain from using my money on this until its fixed so that each profile has its own island.","Just a great game! Hundreds of hours pass unnoticed in it! You can live in this game! Nice music, very funny humor! exciting activities...\r Unfortunately, there are also disadvantages, these are terribly outdated and inconvenient mechanics, unjustified restrictions and complications where it is not necessary...\r The most disgusting thing is that I have to pay for a subscription because only in this case my saves will be restored if the console is broken or lost...","Fantastic game to chill to, and perfect for our current worldwide situation. People are complaining about a lack of cloud saves, and their complaints are warranted, but I don\u2019t think it warrants such negative scores. The game is the best the series has ever been, and with a constantly changing game like this vs its predecessors makes for a more long lasting game. The ability to change the landscape at a whim, the ability to jump over to someone else\u2019s island with ease, and the crafting system makes this the most intricate Animal Crossing released. Is it a perfect game? No, but it\u2019s definitely better than the current user ratings let on.","So this was my first introduction into animal crossing and I gotta say that I'm not all that impressed with the game. It is a very repetitive life sim game that loses interest after so many days of playing. Everyday I do the same thing. Wake up, find my daily bell tree, plant another bell tree, check turnip prices (which always suck for me), check the hot item, and then scavenge for the resources and fossils (or anything donatable to the museum) on my island. That's what I do everyday and it is kind of driving me crazy.\r The villagers don't feel like they have a purpose to be there but to be there. There are plenty of games that do the life sim thing better and add a bit more content than this series.\r It's not an awful game but it doesn't grab me like other games. Also it is kind of messed up Nintendo made it 1 island per switch instead of per profile. It's 2020 guys, there should be no excuse for such a thing.","It is absolutely everything an Animal Crossing game should be... and way more. If you're a fan of past games on the series, add all of the joy those games brought you together and double it. That's just how amazing and addictive it is.","I've spent hundreds of hours, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time. I like customizing clothing, and my island. I love filling up my museum. The animal neighbors are cool. This isn't my first time playing an Animal Crossing game, and this one is the best.","This game is a farming game, but every farming feature is lame, nothing is made to help the player, you perpetually asking you to switch your items, you don't know if your stuff is broken, you can't split a stack of items with the size you want. You can't really play at the same time on the same console...","never knew what the fuss was about with this game, it's pretty much a \"life\" simulator is the best way to describe it, it's alright but not my type of game. Bought to see what it was all about.","This is one of the few honest reviews of Animal Crossing New Horizons you'll see. It's not amazing, it's not terrible. It has its moments and is certainly a different type of game than you might be used to. Very little in the way of an objective, very relaxing, very annoying in terms of repeated dialogue and some awkward controls.\r It's relaxing in a kind of 'do nothing' way and it's all innocent and charming and a nice non-threatening world to dip into now and again. But it's not exactly thrill-filled or the kind of challenge you'll get from a typical game.\r I couldn't care less about multiple players because I'm the only one who plays on my Switch, but if you share your console, your mileage might vary. Doesn't deserve a 10, certainly doesn't deserve a 0. Solid 7/10 game.","Absolutely do not understand the negativity on Metacritic around this game. People went completely mad in the process, as with the Last of Us 2. In Animal Crossing, you want to come back again and again. And you can't play much in one sitting. But that's the point. The desire and ultimate goal in the game is the same-to collect all the items, which are simply unthinkable huge number. And how you will achieve this and how quickly you will get bored is everyone's business. But this game must be played by everyone who has a Switch. Good graphics, nice character style, nice music (the first 30 hours, then the sound turns off:)), interesting opportunities to rebuild your own island, a lot of events, which are also linked to the online, the change of seasons and of course the time that corresponds to the real. Fishing, catching insects, mining, growing trees, settling residents in the form of various animals, collecting shells on the beach, swimming. It seems to be simple things, but how well it is organized. Separately, I would also like to mention online trading with real people. The same items accumulate a lot over time and they need to be put somewhere. Some things are a pity to throw away, so they can be safely sold, for an adequate amount of course. Go to Nookazon and everything will be. In General, even after 490 hours that have already been spent in the game, there is something to do. It is impossible to describe why this game is played, just try it.","I don\u2019t think the game deserves the hate it is given. That\u2019s the reason I give a 10, but I will review it at 9.\rThe experience being just me in my console (no second players) is great. The game actually helps me disappear from life a little bit each day.\r I understand the deal-breaker of the sharing system and just 1 island per Switch. That may be a huge deal-breaker for a lot of folks.","I would give a 10, but this game definitely needs some fine tuning, which Nintendo will probably not listen to. Let us not forget who are we talking about after all.\rThe main reason is the stupid progress being restricted to the first player who boots the game and you can only have a single island per console. The player 1 is the island representative who can makes the progress, everyone who enters the island is unable to make any such progress. For this person the score might be 10.\rOverall, AC is a game where you create a bond with all your villagers and town. You get this change of pace from our fast IRL and see your little village growing into a teeming town, very slowly if you don't change your in-game time and to me, it's that feature that really makes the AC unique.\rSome quality of life tweaks are very needed to make the game more enjoyable IMHO. Such as, bulk crafting, shopping cart in the clothes store and many more. However, that this isn't an enjoyable game overall, the feeling of progress with some new features to the series made the game a nice pick.","Animal Crossing:New Horizons is a fresh and improved title for this lovely and cute franchise. After almost 400 hours of playing it I don't have anything bad to say about it. It's new gameplay mechanics like the terraforming and the crafting are big values to make the gameplay the richest ever. The game has also a lot of updates and the 4 seasons are really great to maximize your experience and make it the most unique amongst other players.\rTo finish, this newest entry in one of the most beloved Nintendo's franchises is a must-have to every Nintendo Switch owner because it's a game that let\u00b4s your creativity flow in the best way possible in building you island at your own way, with your own habitants.","Simple, relajante. Un escape a la tendencia actual donde lo \u00fanico que importa es la calidad de los gr\u00e1ficos. F\u00e1cilmente pasas cientos de horas equipando tu isla (y cambiando todo una y otra vez). Recomendado para todos los que quieren pasar un momento de calma.","Can't share Animal Crossing to family members to create their own island. Rather, they're treated as your employees and the only purpose is to gather and provide resources. So you have to buy a second switch and switch online to make playing animal crossing with family members possible. Almost as bad sellout as Sony indefinitely postponing Last of Us 2 because of the pandemic. It's almost like digital games never event existed! Also, Animal Crossing is super boring. All you do is collect fishes and bugs, I actually thought it was like Farmville where you plant and harvest crops/veges under certain time periods to grow your island. Can't even get a refund cause EB Games is closed till the pandemic is over!","Best game 2020? actually i don't have nintendo switch but i have played it in my friend's. and I'll put 10/10","Only one island per console?!! Why? If there are several people in the family, then you have to play on the same island. Nintendo I'm disappointed.","Excelente juego para relajarte y disfrutar de la isla y lo que propone. Muy recomendable","Los of unassuming relaxed fun, perfect for quarantine season. The visuals are also very cute. And it's obviously very kids friendly","El juego es maravilloso y que bien esta jugarlo en estos tiempos de cuarentena","Fantastic game. 10/10. Screw the haters. This is the fourth or fifth best game on the entire platform.","Fantastic game, i have played 220 hours now and can't put the game down, it's one of the best games on the switch","Come on Nintendo, worst decision ever that a second player is just a glorified NPC. Not gonna fork out for another switch just so my family members can play the game.","One island per switch. I have to let my little sister play and i have to stay \"player 2\"","Great game!!  A lot of fun.  Many new and old elements.  Highly recommended !!!","First of all, I want to say to all players who have given a bad review to this game, due to the creation of only one island per nintendo switch, that this has been this way ALWAYS. If you have played before the AC for Gamecube, City folk, Wild World and New Leaf, ALL OF THEM, only allowed the creation of one city, town, or whatever. All of the other games didnt recieve a negative rating due to this, so please, if you are new in AC, I suggest that you should inform yourself before buying the game.\r Now, putting all that anger aside.... Animal Crossing New Horizons it's been the best game of the series.\r*DIY recipes: A whole new feature that makes you work hard to get specific items and even trade recipes with other players\r*Event and new features updates: Allowing you to have more special visitors, more DIY recipes, more festival events, new building upgrades, etc.\r*Clothing: A huge amount of clothing, costumes and more. All of the clothing with vivid colors and an excellent design.\r*New villagers and new ways to get them: New flashy and adorable villagers like Raymond, Judy, Shreb, etc. And also the new feature: campsite, where you can get a random new villager. You can now help/avoid villagers to leave your island and they cannot move out without your concern. Additionally, if a villager moves out you can invite friends or other people to come and pick up villagers to move to their islands.\r*Nookmiles program: Doing specific activities will allow  you to redeem Nook miles, which can be used for Nook Mileage Items or for Dodo Mystery tours. These activities vary from completing one time only objectives, to random daily chores.\r*Dodo Mystery tours: Allowing you to go to randon small islands where you can not only get more resources but even find a new villager\r*Enhanced online mode: Even though it sometimes crashes, this mode is way better than in the other games. Allowing you to trade, explore, fish, catch bugs, get new DIY, talk with special guests and more.\r In short, if you are looking ofr a life simulation game and love animals, designing and even interacting with other people online, this game is definitely for you. Highly recommended :)!\r PS: Prepare to invest a HUGE amount of your time in designing and decorating your island haha","Boring, gf wanted me to play it with her but progression is hampered by the limited island.","When cloud saves are added this will turn into a 10,if my switch breaks everything is gone and that is garbage","Nintendo is a great videogame company, but with this treatment so bad that it have given us, almost forcing us to buy another Switch if we want to play with someone, it is something that I cannot tolerate","One town per Switch.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","Amazing game, true to the classics and beautiful to boot. I feel like this game was made for the Lite, an on the go world that you can check for a few minutes at a time on your commute (or play for hours while at home). The regular updates have been so good as well!","Amazing animal crossing game. much more customization than before as well as crafting and technical improvements make it the best one in my opinion.","While the one island per console concept is lame, and I understand why people don't like it, I am the only user on my Switch, nobody else plays it or even wants to. I will not judge a game based on a situation I am not in. I WILL however, judge a game based on my experience.\rIt is a fun game, very addicting. I've never been able to get into animal crossing until now. There's something about turning an empty island into a bustling city that appeals to me. Despite the overwhelming amount of games available to me at the moment, I have played animal crossing for at least 250 hours, which is not something I can say of many games.\rYou start off on an empty island in a tent and then work your way up to better housing through loans from the resident loan shark (with no interest, oddly enough). Little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village. You can pull weeds, catch bugs, fish, dig for fossils, design clothes, flags and a great many other things. It does get a bit repetitive, but is fun for me nonetheless. If you are the only person on your switch and you enjoy that kind of gameplay loop, this might be the game for you.","The physical edition is hard to find because everyone is buying it. Thanks a lot Xbox10/10","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game, but I would be amiss to discuss the issues. The game has received a lot of hate for it and that's why the User score is so poor. So how do I feel about this game?\r Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a fun game that you can spend over a hundred of hours in the game. There's so much variety and there's a lot to do. There are a lot of items to collect and a lot to customize your island. There's a huge cast of characters each with their own personality. It's also nice to visit a bunch of other islands. There's so many insects, fish, fossils, and paintings to collect and it's a nice and calm game to play.\r The problems? The game is very slow (I'll explain) and plagued by a lot of bizarre problems that is dumbfounding that Nintendo refuses to fix. So let's discuss each one.\r 1. The local multiplayer. It's effectively useless. You'll need to create a new profile on another user on the Switch. Once you got the other player... they can't do anything useful. You'll essentially just follow the designated leader and you can use tools. How fun.\r 2. The game is \"slow\". No text speed options and every time you talk with someone, there is a lot of repeated and useless text. It results in button mashing to skip the same dialogue. It's a time waster. This is true for a lot of things in this game... it's not a game breaker.. but it's certainly a bit annoying.\r 3. One island per switch. The first player to open the game will become the main account. If you share a switch and have multiple playing the same game, stay away from this game. The main account is the only account that will allow the game to progress in a meaningful way.  If you want to switch who is the main account, you'll have to reset the game and clear all data. Seriously? But why?\r All negative things aside, it's a nice game. If you're a true gamer, I don't see this necessarily being a game for you. It's a family friendly game perfect for kids, girlfriends, non-gamers, and adults that aren't big on games. If you want to share the game with someone, don't.... You'll need a switch per person and a copy of the game per person. AC:NW is a nice game. They are updating the game with free updates and I still have a bit of fun playing it a 1-2 hours per day. It's far from perfect, but the game offers a bit of fun.","A mobile idle game hidden behind a cute Animal vaneer - fun for a few hours until you get bored doing the same thing for no reward.","First Things first: The one Island per console thing is nothing new for the series, and isn't really a problem imo. The problem is the lack of progression for the players outside of  the Citizen Representative. With that out of the way, I can get to gushing: This game is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, and all the additions feel like a true step forward for the series. The ability to place furniture outside is HUGE, and all the creativity that results from Terraforming has basically resulted In an Animal Crossing Renaissance. The same-switch co-op is cool and a nice addition, but Isn't something you'll use much outside of the first few days.  The game does fall short in a couple areas: An (initial) lack of content, a lack of online modes(Like Tortimer Club), and a VERY slow start.\r This game feels like if the series skipped New Leaf and built off of City Folk, but kept the characters from New Leaf.","\u270583%\rMy first Animal Crossing game and will most likely be my last too. A lot of fun though.","I really thought I would hate this game when I got it. A friend of mine kept recommending it and I cracked, I didn't even boot it up for the first two days. Then I started playing and wooow, I love the experience, I've clocked 160 hours so far and while there are a few QOL changes I would recommend, I honestly love it, I'm so addicted, it's so relaxing and so much fun.\r I'm a solo player though, so I don't have the issues the others have.","could have been a awesome game if it wouldn't restrict the second player so extremely.","Extraordinary! Its truly a must have switch titlle! I always get excited every mroning when I wake up to discover and explore the world of New Horizons :) 10/10","This game can be easily categorized as the best Animal Crossing game that Nintendo has put out. The only inconvenience is the fact that there cant be more than one island per console, but personally I and my sister have found it to be a nice bonding experience. The aspects of growth and expertise are noticeable throughout your walkthrough, and rewards the player for building that community to its taste. An incredible game and a must-play for sure.","I feel like this game is either getting hailed as one of the greatest or hated on for its flawed local multiplayer aspect. As I'm the only one playing on my Switch, that does not bother me and nothing is stopping me from joining the ones praising this game greatly.\rHowever, I feel like the game is just... good. I get that it's not designed to take hours of your time daily, but I felt on the first day that it was just extremely empty and it was quite off-putting. Then I began questioning my decision to buy the game; fortunately, there is more to do in the next days.\rSome criticism comes from the \"click A-fest\" that occurs during some conversations. Some people defend it by saying it's a part of the game and it helps the immersion. Well... I would agree if the dialogue would get switched up and I wouldn't need to repeat four choices after getting an error or missclicking the last one. Unfortunately, there is no variance and no new lines. Everyone just keeps repeating their own spiel. Doing things like museum donations or flying to another islands gets super tedious and annoying rather fast. The constant interruptions in multiplayer don't add to the charm either. Read that as: the multiplayer in this game is completely atrocious and utterly useless.\rContent wise the game is good and I feel there is still more for me to uncover. As I like this kind of games in general, I look forward to it - but I have to acknowledge it's definitely not for everyone.","There wouldn't have been a better time for this game to come out than in March 2020. So much is happening in this world right now and all we needed was a calm, relaxing island escape, where we can live a carefree life, without having to worry about politics and economics. All we have to worry about on this island is how to decorate our home, design our own island and live our life to the fullest. I know it's just a game and I know that is has its faults and points of criticism, but in the end you are getting an experience. A game where you can sink hundreds of hours in and lose yourself in its beautiful graphics, jazzy music and tropical vibes. Welcome to your new deserted island getaway package.","Can't even meaningfully play as player 2 on one console, total bs that breaks the game.","I've decided to give it a really low score as I've paid full price for this overhyped mobile game and we've pretty much stopped playing it in the house. Even my 6 year old who is the main player (I also didn't even imagine a developer would do something like this so I let her have a go first) has stopped playing after spending days collecting eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs and eggs.1) Only one island per console2) The first player is the only one, yada, yada, you know where this goes...3) The island is tiny! There is hardly anything to see or do! It's so full I'll looks like a Wii menu or lobby for a larger game. This is no BOTW I'm telling you!4) The camera is something out of the 90s! You can't see what your doing if you're behind an object. It's infuriating!5) Tasks are boring and repetitive. Find wood. Sell. Catch shells. Sell. Pay mortgage. Repeat. Jesus it's dull! Oh wait! A new fish species for the museum!... Oh, it's not, it's an\u20266) EGG! Eggs! Eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs lovely eggs, lovely eggs! Eggs eggs eggs eggs.The game is an absolute ripoff. Go buy 3 or 4 indie titles for the money instead.","Las cuentas secundarias tienen que cambiar en este juego, si hay mas gente en casa no pueden disfrutar por igual. Tienen que cambiar ya!!","So I have been enjoying the game. I've been working on my island and have gotten pasted nooks cranny but then my brother ask to play. Now I have it downloaded on my switch, this would be fine if f@#king animal crossing worked like any other 60 dollar game on switch. I went to do something while my brother started his game. Then when I came back I noticed that his airport was near where my air port was then I saw my house and before I could say anything he put his tent down and now it is just f#*king stuck in my game. This is the most aggravating cheap a$$ move I've ever seen Nintendo pull. This game would straight up be a 10 if my brother didn't exist or much better if Nintendo had more than one f%#king brain cell. I will not be mad at my brother because he is younger than me and he just wanted to play animal crossing but I need to be mad at someone because now my f#&amp;king town has a random a$$ tent in it.","Animal crossing, a game that in these times of isolation comes as a bright light and a hot buy for my switch.  The game play on This new entry is steller!\r While being a relaxing town/island building game mixed with various different things like Fishing, Bug Catching and TERRA-FORMING This game has soooo many things for player to catch and do.\r The bugs and fishes in the game go to Blathers the owl (He hates bugs... so make sure you ask him about every bug you find) The owl then takes the creatures too your Islands HUGE museum! This building is beautiful! the fossil section is the coolest part in my own opinion, it has a very cool trail that shows how the dinosaurs evolved and what there ancestors are in current day.  Make sure you invite your buds to a museum date (and also to flex your fish you caught and they cant cause they are in a different hemisphere) and to show the beautiful and fun spaces around the fun place.\r OK now here is the part where i get a little mad at Nintendo. Listen... I REALLY like this game, but it SUCKS that my Identical Twin brother who ive played couch co-op since the Days of halo reach, cant own his own island. When i told him that he couldn't, he got excited we could live together... but the drawbacks are just too much...  now he just sits there across the room playing Doom Eternal instead of helping me bully a owl with insects for a hour or two.\r Please Nintendo Let My brother have his New Horizon.","Let begin with we're in the freaking year 2020. There has been games like little big planet, stardew valley, ect. great examples of sandbox games and ux/ui that is intuitive, but yet this game has no inovation and has features that can be programed by a monkey. Their formula has stayed the same since 2002 its 2020 for christ sake. This is just another low quality franchise like pokemon just churning game low quality games for a fat paycheck. WTF are they rendering or executing that they could not implement a standard of 2020. if this isn't the issue then devs speak up.\r I dove into the game after my wife had her introduction to it. I spend 3 days playing the game just slowing grinding material, however I start to wonder, how do I progress in the game?!\r So after avoiding trying to spill anything in the game by searching it up. I find out the game is severely restricted for any secondary inhabitant of the island.\r This business practice is disgusting. lost all my faith and business.","Nintendo blocked all players from recovering their island after replacing their stolen Switch console. My island is gone forever.","The idea of letting us play together is great, but the fact that my step-dad is THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING IS TERRIBLE, EA is better than this, no company has been so evil as to limit you like this in an attempt to sell more consoles, screw you Nintendo","My wife and I love the game but we only have one switch and therefore one island and totally different schedules. It would be OK if we could have multiple islands on different memory cards or buy the game multiple times to have multiple islands or something but because only one of us can be the resident representative it's made it incredibly frustrating.\r The local co-op is really a bad experience, and it's so frustrating because we both love the game so much and this really makes it difficult when we can only have one island :(. Really really sad :(","This game in itself is excellent. HOWEVER it has a big flaw that ruins everything, the way the game despises secondary players. Secondary players are practically in-game visitors, spectators who can hunt insects and fish, collect fossils and buy items, and nothing else. For the progress of the island, secondary players need the main player, the first player who played and created the island. Sharing the island is great, it is in keeping with the spirit of the saga, what is outrageous is that the game does not allow secondary players to do anything. The secondary players cannot, for example, create new constructions, such as bridges or the store, they cannot donate materials for the construction of these projects ... In addition they also do not have access to a significant amount of item recipes ... They cannot participate in the missions of the game ... That is NOT FUN. This game should be appropriate to share with your family or your partner, with your loved ones, but clearly Nintendo does not want that. Nintendo wants you to buy a new Switch to play the full version of the game ... Attention! Not a new copy of the game, but a damn new console! Nintendo your console is great, but it is a family console not individual. For the love of God patch it. Nintendo, you have ruined the gaming experience.","Una sola isla , es un asco . No puedes seguir avanzando, solo te queda recoger madera","Pros:\r-Great early/mid game\r-It's exciting to keep catch new creatures\r-Gardening is fun early game\r-Conversations with animals are fun early/mid game\r-Crafting system is amazing\r-Multi-player is fun early game\r Cons:\r-Conversations are repetitious after a while\r-Getting a villager to leave is almost impossible without cheating. Please add a feature of some sort where you can choose an option in \"Red Text\" three days in a row to get a villager to leave. People are going to time travel anyways.\r-Playing multiplayer with friends should not take so long each time to have someone come into your island. It's disrupting. The individual player should see the traveling screen, and then just pop a notification when it's been loaded into their friend's island.\r-You can only play one profile per Switch. Same console multiplayer isn't fun. Split-screen or individual menus would have been better, as well as not having only one person who can make decisions. It's a family console - Resident Representative should be a shared title, so they can all move things the way they want, or even have their own islands and use Call Resident to play them on the same island but keep menu functions.\r-No way to rotate camera for pictures, except to angle up. You can do it inside, why not outside?\r-Shopping gets boring after a while. Could the furniture selection change maybe twice daily? 7am and 7pm would be good I think. Or make a multiplayer selling option, bring back Reese and Cyrus to sell things to other players for you for a price you set (no more than a certain percentage over their regular price)\r-More visitors to campsite, more frequently. Let them teach players new patterns specific to that character. If each character had more specialty items it would be great.\r-Pocket camp lets you invite people to hang out, so why can't you here? Maybe be able to ask a villager to come hang out, they leave after 3 hours and are unavailable for x number of hours/days. This way people could rotate and see the characters more, and get unique things for them","If I was able to change resident representatives I would give this a higher score. Absolutely awe full that I have to wait for my husband to play to progress the game.","This is a good game to play Single Player.  Quality gameplay, unique characters, not overly complicated.  Just an enjoyable game.  For anyone who has played the original Animal Crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset.  Because you probably played with family members at the time, and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then. This version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back then.The trade off I suppose is that they enabled an okay form of online play.  But when it comes to Animal Crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town.They would be able to progress the town if you weren't there, interact with the town folk, the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play.  And you really felt like you were living in the same town/area.  You'd be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it.  But hey, that's life.  Well now that 2nd, 3rd, 4th player cant progress the story, or help new residents move in.  Some DIY creations are kept from them.  And it downright sucks to be that person.  Multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why I'm giving it a 6 star.  Last quick bit on their online play: it is okay.  At least each person will get their own screen there. But it's not optimized and obviously hasn't gone through any QA testing.Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why I'm taking the time to write this review.  Ultimately my personal thought is they royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect.  But again the series is great, the concept is great.  Ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now.  I'm excited to see what they add in future updates!  Edit:  P.S. Sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where I had to tell my brother to return the game.  As he was hoping he'd be able to play it with his wife.  And once I told him about the issues he was in complete agreeance.  It's just not worth buying the game for that.  Worth pointing that out, because this isnt just some little mistake. They do need to fix it.","\u5171\u4eab\u5cf6\u5dbc\u8ddf\u8cc7\u6e90\u4efb\u52d9\u662f\u4ec0\u9ebc\u5566\uff0c\u5f88\u778e\u8036\u9019\u662f\u8981\u903c\u4eba\u5bb6\u8cb7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u53f0\u6a5f\u5b50\u55ce\uff1f\u4efb\u52d9\u6703\u88ab\u63a5\u624b\u3001\u8cc7\u6e90\u6703\u88ab\u5206\u6524\u3001\u5c31\u9023\u9053\u5177\u90fd\u662f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u5b8c\u5168\u9055\u80cc\u7d93\u71df\u578b\u904a\u6232\u7684\u521d\u8877\u5427\uff0c\u6211\u7adf\u7136\u6c92\u8fa6\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7d93\u71df\u8207\u638c\u63a7\u6211\u7684\u5cf6\u5dbc","I think it is a good game, having played some of the other animal crossings, I think people who play solo just don't realize how bad the multiple player is. You can't buy a second game to have your own island, you can't use a separate game card to have your own island, you can only buy another switch and another game. My family has one switch, three people, no problems with any other game, but the thing is if one person completes something neither of the other two get to experience it at all. You can NOT get the full game experience if multiple people share a switch. It is a horrible design flaw. The switch is a home console, not a single person game device. I do not think the developers thought this through enough and need to fix it.","A beautifully crafted game with lots to do. My favorite part is how it works with the days. How ever i have 1 quarrel, i work sun-thursday and i have to work at 5 am to 2 pm and i cant utilize trading or buying turnips and i paid 60$ of this game and itd be nice if i could utilize every part of the game. Also i wish you could change the name of your island after the fact","This game is down right terrible. Complete laziness by the designers and then locked to one island per switch where only the first person to create a profile can fully advance the island and enjoy the game is a disgusting ploy that feels like they are just trying to sell consoles. The laziness comes about not even having a proper 3rd person camera. I would let some of this slide if it was a 20 dollar game at most. I have played free mobile games with better physical control design and options than. It's a cheap game at a high price to try and trick consumers into buying another console to fully enjoy it. When the game falls so flat on its face it would never be worth buying another switch to maybe enjoy it. I hope to God I can return it to Wal-Mart tomorrowThe one game a year I buy for my birthday I budget specifically for I am going to pissed if I am stuck with this dumpster fire.","This game is good but only the first player gets to use the game.

Nintendo needs to fix this ASAP","While the 1st player can receive tasks and make progress with the story, all the other players have terrible gameplay. Nintendo please fix this by, for instance, alternating the player who Tom Nook gives tasks to. The game is great, but only for a single player.","One island per switch....which is quite underlying the most ridiculous decision ever made. Not to mention at this time where we are in a crisis. And you want us to buy two SWITCHES just because people want more than one island on a video game...seriously....","As the # 2 player on an island I must give this wonderful game a 0. I do this in solidarity with all my suffering #2 island \"citizens\", but that word, citizen, isn't right. Citizens, are counted. Citizens have a say in decisions.

He is almost too embarrassed to continue on.

What should I do, is buying another console the only way to play the same game simultaneously with a friend of mine, or with my brother? Are you crazy or something?","Really enjoy the game. But due to the fact that only the resident representative can progress the game the rest of the game is inaccessible to my character and I have to wait for my girlfriend to play which isn\u2019t as frequent. I don\u2019t mind that only one player can pick where houses go but at least give us access to the recipes and ability to contribute to the projects. Completely asinine game design.","Money grab? It should be labeled very clearly on the game not to buy this game if you are intending to share it with your family. I've already lost interest in the game being the second player. It is such a shame. With everything going on this would have been the perfect outlet for the three people in my home.","The one island rule is ridiculous and should be removed immediately. Game is not worth buying whatsoever if you have more than one person in the household.","This game is built on GREED, and it is taken to a whole new level. It blows my mind how they purposely designed this so only one open game can be played per switch. All users must share the same island, which is only built for one. Buying second copies wont help. Oh no, Nintendo wants you to buy a second switch, maybe even a third with additional copies for each of course. Wow. We all bought your damn game what more do you want? Save your money and pass on this one for the principal alone. They didnt even share this flaw until it was too late.","Would actually give this a full 9 or 10, but this game is ruined in my house unless we buy an entire second Switch console (which is ridiculous). My partner wants to play this game, but can't make his own island, and as I've already started, has way less say over being creative on the island.

It keeps a lot of core mechanics such as fishing, weeding, bug catching, etc., and adds an interesting crafting mechanic. You get to build up your island with amenities and help new animal neighbors move in. However, if you're not the first player (island representative), your gameplay will be limited. You can't help with moving in new villagers or getting shops up and running. You're arbitrarily restricted from parts of the game. You don't get access to crafting recipes or tools you need until player one passes certain milestones. Some recipes are only ever given to player one. And there's no way to have access to the whole game as player two. You have to buy a whole new console (yes, console, not game.) If you're the only person who uses your Switch or nobody else will ever want to play Animal Crossing on it, it's an excellent game. But expect any secondary players to be locked out of some of the game and disappointed.","Only one island per switch..... seriusly nintendo??? We need a update soon....","haha how on Earth did they end up restricting it to one island per CONSOLE? Did they only let rich people playtest the game? Did they forget that real humans don't have access to infinite Switches? Absolutely surreal incompetence and the most Nintendo thing I've ever seen. They consistently manage to make the best games out there and then run then under terrible UI and restrictive design choices.","Surely madness!!I went to buy 2 copies of Animal Crossing today and thankfully the store attendant said \u2018You do know you can only have 1 island per Switch\u2019 I\u2019m hazarding a guess they may have had few games returned already!I said that\u2019s fine I have 2 switches because I have 3 children and we like to cross play on games. Then it dawned on me. I could create an island for me on my switch but who would get to create their island on the other Switch?Draw lots? Choose a favourite child?!Anyway the only choice I was left with was to return both the games as it really would have caused big arguments.So from us that has been a big fail regarding sales and I am not being bitter in saying I hope this doesn\u2019t work out for them and they patch it. It certainly feels like a horrendously corporate, commercial piece of programming. Unless there is sensible reasoning behind it but with expandable memory on the Switch I can\u2019t see what.It may be worth mentioning this fact as I feel it could be a deal breaker for many families considering buying the game.","We bought a digital copy for our Switch, because Nintendo said only one island per Switch, so we thought it would be a great game for our family of five to play together. Unfortunately, the game is unplayable because it requires one person to be the Resident Representative (witch is by default the first person to log into the game). DO NOT buy this game if you will play with more than one person. It has been a terrible experience for our family. Nintendo has been extremely deceptive in their promotion of this game as a multiplayer game. It is a single player game PERIOD! Only the first person to log into the game has the ability to play the main game, all the other people cannot play the main game, they just wait to the Resident Representative to play the actual game and then the other players get do a few things. Do not buy this game is you are planning to play with your family, everyone will be frustrated and angry. I wish I could return the game to the store or sell my copy, but unfortunately I bought it digitally. I expected better from Nintendo. I want to give this game a 9 for it's content, but at the present time, without an update to the local multiplayer sharing, it's a 4.5.","Only the first player can do projects and participate actively in the island the rest of local players are like guests in the game.","The one island per console system has spoiled an otherwise fantastic game for my family.","Overall the game is great! The only thing that really bothers me is that villagers always say the same things... they don't seem to have a real character anymore... and their sentences are always really short and sometimes pretty mean. It would be great if Nintendo could re-work that :)","One island per switch! Disgusting... Do not purchase until problem is rectified. Bought to play with family and now my purchase means nothing and I'm diminished to playing follow the leader. Considering moving onto a console that respects their clients.","I bought the game on a Switch shared by my wife and me, and I created my character and visited the island first. Then she created her character and visited the island (you can only have one island on a console). Come to find out, she can't progress at all in the game until I play it, and she doesn't have any ability to improve the island on her own. What an absolutely boneheaded game design. If you plan on having multiple people play this game at once, I would warn you not to waste your money.","This game is probably fantastic but I cannot play it in anyway it\u2019s truly meant to be because they only allow one person per console to play the game. I don\u2019t care that one island. Can support 8 players because there is only one person able to do anything fun. They rest are just sentient NPCs. It\u2019s unfair and unjustifiable. It\u2019s completely unrealistic to expect families to spend a minimum of 270 dollars for every person who wants to play this game the way it should be played. No other games have this restriction meaning this was done intentionally to drag more money out of already paying customer. Ridiculous. Big fail on Nintendo\u2019s side.","Sure it's a great game if you are the only player but Nintendo can get **** for the 2nd player limitations they've instituted. Don't buy this unless you support Nintendo's ploy to hold customers ransom in hopes that they'll buy a whole second or third console just so everyone in the house can play this game.","No cloud saves. No legitimate local multiplayer. No sharing the game between users on the same switch. No save transfer between consoles. This game is a massive failure on a technical level by 2020 standards, and embarrassingly even by the original Animal Crossing from 19 years ago, which didn't lock your save to the console.","The game costs \u00a350, a switch costs hundreds, yet nintendo expects users to buy another console if they wish to start a new island. Its money grabbing and scummy. I'm not giving this 0, because for whatever reason doing that would invalidate how shady and terrible that move was on nintendo's part. They market it as multiplayer, yes, but only on one island. Only one account holds full control.They clearly dont consider how a family might feel, how that would work for families with kids, multiple children. I dont want my brother ruining my save file, I dont want to restart it either, just to have a Dr sh experience while  waiting for bunny day to end. waiting for bunny day to finally end.","Buy another switch? Not cool guy! Instead I\u2019ll buy a number Pat! I\u2019ll buy a Zero!","Give second players more freedom. I understand that the reason that they built the game this way was that \"they want people to connect\". So I can actually accept why they had people share an island, but why does the progression need to be dependent only on the 1st player. It ruins the experience for the other players.","Disappointing that families that share a switch can\u2019t have their own save file and island. My wife started the game, so I don\u2019t even bother playing since my experience will be arbitrarily constrained by Nintendo. Mind boggling decision by them. User accounts exist for a reason! Hope they fix it soon.","One island per console (meaning only one user gets the first-playing experience) on a $59 game? You must be crazy.","Created a metacritic account only to rate this half of a game. It's disappointing when you have to read a FAQ to find out about the one island per console issue. This is a fantastic game for whoever plays first, but I have to drop it 5 points for for this one issue alone. I can only see my youngest getting frustrated he can't do certain things without getting on the oldest ones account. I'm new to animal crossing, and apparently this holds true to formula, but this is a Nintendo Switch. Utilize it's potential and make separate islands we can all have freedom to make our own decisions on. If you want to stick to the one island, make it so each island is linked to each other (separated by rivers, and later accessable using bridges). Major oversight in console gaming and it's obvious the community isn't happy. Time to switch up the formula on the Switch devs. Pretty sure this will be a one and done for our household.","If you're the second player to load this game on your switch, enjoy playing the demo version of the game.\r lets say you own a game on PS4, but your brother played it before you did. Now every time you play that game, you only get to enjoy a quarter of the features and can't play the game further until your brother does... unless you buy a second PS4.\r Sounds pretty stupid, why is Switch any different?\r The people defending this terrible, corporate greed design choice choice seem to have the argument \"Oh but this is how the last game was\"\r Its cool to have a limited co-op feature, but why is this the only option?\rwhy can't the second player play through the full-featured single player game?\rWell, everyone knows why.","This is disgusting to force people buy a second console in addition to enjoy the game in couple. You've just ruin your reputation Nintendo. You suck.","Avere solo un'isola rovina il gioco,poi \u00e8 super ripetitivo.\rLo sconsiglio fortemente.","They had the audacity to advertise this as a \"family\" game, yet only the first profile on the console who started the game first can actually experience the story and progress, while player 2 will have to share the island and is pretty much a \"visitor\" with no control over what happens, no point gathering resources, even the animals treat you like a visitor. It pretty much ruins the whole experience. They obviously did this out of pure greed to sell more switch consoles and i have lost all respect for them.  All I can ask is please bring in an update where, even if they wont let other people on the console have their own island, at least let us have the option of equal control. This game really could have been great if they didnt ruin it by doing this..","Solo el primer jugador que haya creado la isla, puede hacer que avance, mi novio se ha interesado por jugar y vaya, he tenido que darle las herramientas como el hacha o la pala, porque no ten\u00eda la opci\u00f3n de conseguirlas por \u00e9l mismo. Gracias nintendo por hacerme gastar 60 euros en un juego que no sirve para mucho m\u00e1s que jugar una persona sola....","Have owned this game a few days now and the single player is fun, though a little slow to ramp up. I don't mind the progression, though; as a parent I only have limited time to play it anyway. My main gripe is the same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly - the decision to lock each Switch to one island. Previous games may have done this, but save files were treated differently when they were stored on cartridges; this was a design choice.\r When I played the original game, I remember another family member and I were both able to play and have fun. Reading about the functionality for multiple players now, though, I don't feel like it's even worth inviting someone else to play. It seems like a lot of features, even beyond being able to place buildings and such (which it makes sense to restrict to one person), are missing for succeeding players.\r So if you're alone, this is a great game. If you want something for multiple people to play, it's disappointing.","Wow wish I could play but I don't want to share the same island as  my roommates so I guess I'm SOL. Waited this long and spent $60 for nothing. Do not purchase or support this game until a \"fix\" is released","I share a switch with my wife. I can't play the game without playing on my wife's island. I'm not able to do anything meaningful or advance the story at all. Waste of time and money for me until this is fixed. Thanks","I liked the game itself, but like the others, I\u2019m upset that only one user can play the game normally - the one who first enters the game, and this does not even displays anywhere. Is this such a way to earn more on people? We have already come to terms with the fact that there is only one island on one console, so to speak, for the \"rallying of the family\", but the same \"rallying of the family\" is not work because of only one user can play normally. Nintendo, this is just unfair.","El juego ser vac\u00edo , no haber islas , zas zas , no cavernas , no mamuts ,zas zas","The very fact that Nintendo in their infinite wisdom have only allowed one island per console means this game gets an absolute zero. Total **** move on their part, based on greed and nothing more.","General game is OK, but multiplayer is probably the worst I ever seen, seems it is a Nintendo desperate try to force people to buy more consoles? that is super unfair, in summary if more than one people is willing to play in the same console I wish you good luck as this game is a single player game (per console, not per user), all the main activities and real fun are tied to the first person that started the game the second, third or so players are a kind of dummies without nothing too much to do.","GREAT JOB NINTENDO!! WOOOOOOOW.....That's a fun game if you are the only user that's going to play it. When we got this game, i knew that we can't have 2 islands, i accepted that, but now i know that the player 2 Can't do anything to the main history. WHAT THE F*** NINTENDO?? What Now?? Do i need to buy another console only to play it properly??? That's my first Nintendo main console and i Like it very much, but this super passion Nintendo has to take all the money from Their fans, makes me really angry! I really hope they fix all this SHI*... Maybe the solution is to move to ps5 or xbox. Dude I'm so frustrated and angry... 60 hours of game play to realize...","Multiplayer restrictions kills the game for me. One island? What a joke, this should be a game for family and everyone should have a chance to play. This is one big NO from me.","Seriously? ONE island per Nintendo Switch? Hello? This is a family oriented gaming console. There is definitely more than one person playing this machine. Use your brain Nintendo! I'm disputing the charges with my credit card company to get my money back. This is the most idiotic design system I've seen today.","First off yes not having your own island is kinda annoying, but it's always been that way every game prior and nobody complained about it. people who give zeros obviously haven't played the game, because this is probably the best  game on switch apart from Zelda. Yes the game is slow but it is nowhere near boring, you always have an objective to do like paying off your mortgage, inviting new neighbors, etc. This game is mean't to be play like when walk through a park or go on a hike, it's not explosive excitement but it is really relaxing and satisfying. upgrading your house and finishing a section in the museum is incredibly rewarding. In fact have one island per switch is the best part, I have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded. having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home, being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal. it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer. In the end, unless you hate your family or roommates having one island won't affect you and maybe it will help you to appreciate others more.","Magn\u00edfico juego que te distrae de todos los problemas del mundo y da una experiencia \u00fanica. Merece mucho la pena","This game is absolutely revolting! I can\u2019t even believe the audacity of Nintendo for creating a \u201cmultiplayer game\u201d that only really allows ONE PLAYER to play!!! I bought this game to play with my family, only to find out that ONLY ONE PLAYER GETS TO MAKE ANY REAL DECISIONS, and if this was advertised it would be one thing, but since you can only really find out while playing THIS GAME RIPPED ME AND MY FAMILY OFF!! This should be patched immediately or at least ADVERTISED!! Don\u2019t buy if you want to play it multiplayer or with your family.","great overall game, extremely polished and gorgeous  graphics, however it seems like the writing in the game is a lot less enjoyable than past games, everyday when i speak to my villagers it\u2019s the same thing over and over again. unlike the prior games  there is a lot less joy in speaking to them it kind of sucks actually, the dialogue that is. seems like the developers focused mainly on the graphics and gameplay","Would be a 9 or 10 for me but I literally can\u2019t even progress in the game...let my 6 year old create the island because she was excited to play, I then created a character and so did my partner. We played for a long time before realising that all the islands tasks are basically tied to the person who played the game first and any additional residents have absolutely no say in anything whatsoever, they don\u2019t even have visibility on progress to that they can contribute materials etc. Nintendo need to patch this ASAP...if the little one decided to stop playing one day, my character that I\u2019ve spent so long on is absolutely useless. For such a social game on a family oriented console, this is totally unacceptable. A simple option to change who the resident representative is would suffice.","Couch co-op is LITERALLY, actually, unplayable. Player two cannot access inventory, cannot drop items they pick up, cannot craft, cannot build, cannot do literally ANYTHING. What the hell????Player two can literally only follow player one around, touching nothing. If you pick anything up, as player two, it disappears. There is no point playing. Even if I wanted to log in under my profile to play, since my wife made the island first, it is 100% LOCKED onto her playthrough. I can't do anything. $60 down the drain. DO NOT BUY.","A haiku about why this game is terrible\rThere is no Rover\rHe was replaced by Timmy\rHe deserves justice","Thought I\u2019d have a great time getting into a series I\u2019ve been recommended by friends for years. I can\u2019t even enjoy my own single player experience because I happened to be the second person in my house to make a character. Waste of money.","This may not be the most complex game, but something about it is undeniably charming and addictive. The little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them.\r There are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though, like only having one game per console. Luckily that doesn't really affect me, or I would have had a real problem with this game. It would also be good if you could play couch co-op with full functionality for the second player. The second player can't really do much. There are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once. I think there are also some kinks to be worked out with kicking villagers out. There are 3 villagers that I want OUT and I haven't talked to them for a month, and they still won't leave. The only ones that ask to leave are ones that I actually like. So that's just been pretty annoying for me. I also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion. I wish there was some factor of skill points that show your fishing experience level, or your friendship level with a villager. This may be getting a little too complicated though, but it's just my preference. Another thing is it's very rare that the villagers or Tom Nook actually asks you to complete any activities such as fetch this specific bug, or make this furniture. This feels like a completely missed opportunity to fulfill requests for the villagers. (I know this is something that is a feature in the game, but for some reason in my experience this opportunity rarely ever pops up). I do wish there were a more things to do in the vein of quests, but I think the seasonal events will keep things interesting for the foreseeable future.\r It's easy for me to point out all of the faults I have with this game but it's hard to explain why I still love it despite all its faults. It has it's problems, and on paper isn't much to do, but there's just something about it. Overall, it's a very slow burn but it is satisfying to see your island develop from nothing and to your own ideal island aesthetic and friendships. The game has it's problems, but it's easy to overlook them because of how charming and addictive it is.\r Before I go, I have to shoutout my favorite villagers: APPLE and MERENGUE. They're adorable and perfect and I would die for them.","The game would be a whole lot better if they had added the Dream Suite as well as Club Tortimer back to the game. At the moment even with quite a bit of progression it seems like they released an unfinished game with even less content than they had in New Leaf.\rIt's still a beautiful game, don't get me wrong. But within a month even without Time Travelling I've nearly completed the museum and have already gotten close to receiving golden tool DIY Recipes.\rIf Nintendo added the dream suite and club tortimer back with its public island as well as a lot of the other features they added in the previous instalment then I would be rating this way higher.\rBut so far it just seems like the game is a carbon copy of the previous games before New Leaf that's even been dumbed down by just giving a crafting option to make it seem as if the game is giving you \" MORE THINGS TO DO \", when in reality you're really just repeating the same stuff over and over and over again tediously. For being a Flagship IP of Nintendo, this game really let me down with the expectations I had for it and I wouldn't be surprised if this would prevent me from buying the next one or further Nintendo Consoles because of this as this game was the reason I purchased the switch.","I bought this game for my mom and son to play after the first day they were fighting about everything. Only one island per console bulls*** has ruined what could have been a great game. If I would have known this I would not have wasted my money.","The game on its own is great but the local coop mode is awful. There are so many limitations to it which make it such a pain to play that it isn\u2019t even fun. You can\u2019t drop in and drop out, you need to load the whole game again if one person wants to go solo but they happened to join last. The controls for player 2 are terrible and you spend ages scrolling through your tools when that could so easily be fixed with the proper tool wheel. You can\u2019t play on other islands with other players either which is so lame. This is not to mention the main, and worst limitation.... which is Nintendo money grubbing all over - you\u2019ll have read about it before but you can only have one island per console and only one player (the first player to do so..) will be able to run through the story mode (I for one won\u2019t be buying ANOTHER Switch and ANOTHER copy of the game just to have my own island). There is no reason for this and Nintendo could just as easily allow 2 islands or more per console. I would love to recommend this game but, if you\u2019re going to play coop, I would stay away until these issues get resolved. Though knowing Nintendo that is unlikely to ever happen.","1 island per console? Is this a joke? Do not buy this game if you have family that will also want to play.","We waited for a very long time for this game and with three children in the house plus myself who was looking forward to playing, it is extremely disappointing to find out that only one person can own an island and that everyone else has to share!

I had my house upgraded two times, I was rich in both bells and miles, had worker through more than half accomplishments to receive miles, yet I wasn't getting any directions for the creation of tools, buildings and other stuff. I almost cried when I came across an article talking about the limitations of sencond players and how I would never get the game to develop as one. . What a waste... This is just messed up to do to a player.","Awesone single player, but local co-op, inability to have a second island for my gf, limitations of what a second person can do on the island are asinine, no one is going out to buy a second switch and second copy, it a giant middle finger for the price tag, and I'm seriously going to consider if I'll make purchases from nintendo until the reviews roll in, complete faith breaker","My sister and i bought the game, she started playing and when i wanted to play, i could only go to her island even though i was using a different profile, the game only lets you have one island per CONSOLE not per account (Why on earth?) so basically the only way to play for me is to share my sisters island. why bother?","ONLY ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE I was completely mortified and heart broken I have finally saved up enough money to buy the **** game and I let my younger brother play first since he was so excited because we use to play Animal crossing New leaf. the next day I turned it on so ready to create my own island and my own clothes and GUESS **** WHAT it doesn't let me. I start asking google and I find out there's only a one island restriction per CONSOLE! My heart was shattered I have been waiting for this game Since they announced it and turns out I can't even enjoy the full experience Since I can't buy another console and for that FACT another copy of the game for that console WHAT THE **** NINTENDO FIX THIS, THIS IS A CONSOLE THAT WAS MADE FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS THE SWITCH IS NOT A DAMN 3DS\r This is a great game and my little brother loves it but me and my other sibling including my parents feel like NPCs since the first person is considered the founder and the other players are just another character on the island. I love my little brother but me and my family members don't want to live on an island called bubblepop no not living as GUEST! we want to have our own islands SEPARATELY with different names and all progressing at different TIMES! I am very disappointed in this game and I instantly give it a 0/10 I would give it even lower if I could.","Okay, first 1 save files is trash. I was going to try to share the joy of Animal crossing with a loved one, but the way the game is That person would need their own switch or to exclusively use mine. I find this terrible.\r Nintendo ALLOW US TO HAVE MULTIPLE SAVE FILES!.","Never thought I would enjoy it so much. It's reallly good at what it does. However, the multiplayer isn't as good as it should be.","The limitation of one island per Switch (not per cartridge, per Switch) is no good. It\u2018s obvious Nintendo is just trying to sell more... Nintendo bad attitude !!!","Best game of the 2020, totally worth the 59 bucks, i never thought this game would give me so Many Hours","If you plan on playing this on a shared switch device, you're in for a nasty surprise. whoever starts the game is the main player with ALL the control of the island.  All other players who are created afterwards, are forced to join Main player's island and CANNOT progress if the Main player doesn't progress. There is no way to switch who the Main player is.  I mistakenly let my younger daughter play first since she was excited to try.  Now my other older child (who i originally bought it for) is so angry that she cannot progress in the game and has to log into younger childs account and put in extra hours to progress in the game.  Then younger child gets angry that older child has changed things on her account, and fighting ensues!!!  BAD DESIGN ON THIS NINTENDO!  So then I buy another switch thinking it will solve this problem but there is NO WAY to transfer her game data to the new switch and she doesn't want to start over!!

You could even do it in the original new super mario bros, a 14 year old game for an underpowered, casual riddled handheld! this has really hammered home the fact that nintendo is a years behind its competition. im extremely dissapointed in nintendo and hope they fix the issue.

Fix the problem and i'll fix the score.","One island per SWITCH?  Inexcusable. Wish they gave refunds!  This is nothing more than a money grab.  Do not buy this game.","This is a real disappointment for me. The game just isn\u2019t meant to be played by more than one person at a time. The limitation of \u201cOne island per console\u201d makes it a lackluster experience for anyone who isn\u2019t the founder of the island. I\u2019m finding that, if I let my wife play first, when I get into my account there\u2019s nothing left for me to do. It\u2019s pretty slimy to make people spend $250-500 extra on top of the $60 price of the game to make their own island. Nintendo is losing my respect here. Always knew Sony and Microsoft didn\u2019t care about the user experience, just how much money they make. It\u2019s an even playing field now, I guess.","Horrible Game that makes it impossible to enjoy for more than 1 player. gj nintendo","Yes multiplayer is dumb. Yes it is lacking a cloud save. Yes it does suck to not be the first person on the island. I am fortunate enough to be the only player in my household so dealing with some of the issues above isn't something I have to do. Aside from visiting folks from the active and delightful community around the game.\r My first animal crossing was ACNL which I loved despite some of it's QoL issues. ACNH addresses many of those issues and adds fun mechanics that keep me returning daily. I've sunk a shameful amount of hours in since launch. Although I've slowed considerably, I still log on daily to do some digital chores. I love my little island.","This game is amazing! I played the original, New Leaf, and now this, and I can see where they upgraded its quality. It's beautiful, creative, and so original, its an all out great game. People who rate the game 0 or 2 because of its problem that you can't own more than 1 world on 1 Nintendo Switch are people who haven't gotten the full experience, and also ignorant people who didn't think to look up the details of the actual game. Play singleplayer, and it's the best thing ever. I would've rated it a ten, but no, this problem is bad and all, but a 0 or 2 rating because of the multiplayer being messed up is just not right. The game released last month, an update could be put out and could improve multiplayer. Besides the one problem, this game is one of my favorites on the Switch so far.","By far the best in the Animal Crossing/Forest series. It does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in, after a certain event, that somewhat signifies the end of the \"tutorial\" if you could really call it that. But after that you'll soon learn that in Animal Crossing, there is always something to do! The \"Nook Miles\" are a great addition, giving you something to do even when you are done with your daily \"chores\", which only consist of the usual Animal Crossing activities such as fishing and catching bugs, doing favors etc. It should also be noted that the game improves upon New Leaf in a variety of ways. For instance the sound design is spectacular! One of the best sounding games on the Switch system, if not the best overall. There are some things however that are cause for controversy, such as the local multiplayer issue, in which the \"leader\" is pretty much the only one who gets to do anything, while any one else can collect materials, they go to the recycling bin in the resident services tent/building, which is fine till you realize that anyone can access that, and take the other players stuff, and to top it off the second player can't take it till either they are the leader, or they boot up the game by themselves. Another setback is the exclusion of cloud saves/backups. While Nintendo has stated that there will be a way to get your island back in the case of console loss or theft, it has not to my knowledge been implemented yet. So basically  for now say your console got stolen, you would lose all of your progress, and as someone who has accidentally lost their save game, it is not a great time building back up what you lost. So, in conclusion the game is sub-par... just kidding this is the best selling Animal Crossing for a reason, if you have the means to purchase this game DO, you will not regret it, just keep in mind some of the disappointing aspects of the game, and try to keep your console itself safe! I know that times are rough right now, so I just wanted to say to any one who actually reads this, if you can't afford the game do NOT go out of your way to buy it, save your money for food and other living costs! Stay safe, and have fun!","People are being way to bad on this game. Yeah, being limited per console sucks, but otherwise it is probably the best animal crossing game in the series.","This game is good but it's just overhyped by the critics and i got tricked to buy and play this game to find nothing special with it","This would be a great game if Nintendo would just fix the ridiculous multiplayer mode and the only-one-island problem.  My kids just want to sit and play it together with a split screen where they can all make decisions.  Let them each have their own island or stop advertising this as a multiplayer game.  As is, it's nothing more than a source of constant frustration for everyone except the first player.  Nintendo, fix your game!","I bought this game to play with my wife but the one island limitation is ridicules! Her experience was very limited because I got to play it first!

This isn't one island per profile, not one island per cartridge, but it's one island per SWITCH CONSOLE!!!! This is just greedy horse crap there is ZERO reason to have one island per console. The game-play is good, but this island limit kills the entire experience for me, and just makes me furious not to mention that only the first player to create the island is allowed to progress it so the second player can't even do anything meaningful.","Such an incredibly charming game for when one is in quarantine. The lightheartedness is truly something special.","The WHOLE POINT of getting this game was to enjoy playing TOGETHER. Nintendo is just being greedy when they require you to buy TWO switches, and TWO copies of the game to play co-op with your spouse.

No luck getting it back either, not with their \"no refunds ever\" policy.","Only one person can enjoy the game on the same console. Only the first player can make progress. The second gets the leftovers. Shame on you, Nintendo!","RE: One Single Island Per Console, Shared by all users.\r It is incredibly frustrating that the game is only One-Island-Per-Console. My wife and I have different users and NSO sign-ins, and it sucks that we can't each have our own island short of buying two Nintendo Switches (difficult with COVID) and two copies of the game.\r Why on earth would Nintendo go out of their way to make this unlike almost every other game and application ever written that respects multiple users. It is bad enough each user can only have one Island/World/Profile, but to force other users to share them is really really dumb. Like to the point my wife doesn't even want to play a game I'm pretty sure she'd love.\r Anybody who has ever had to share a console knows that this sucks. Anyone with siblings over 30 knows how bad it sucks when someone screws with your save-data-slot. There isn't only 128K free for save data. The files cannot be that big. There is no good reason for this.\r While the game is wonderful otherwise, this is a glaring, absolute foundational defect that completely ruins the gameplay and usability. If there is some technical reason why this \"must\" be the case, the island is going to get extremely small if 7 additional users put buildings on it.","You can only have 1 island across an entire console. :^( No experience for me then i guess.

The reason is that the player that created the island (in this case her) gets to be the primary character and any others are \u201cguests\u201d who are just tagging along.What makes things worse is that I cannot even create a separate Save File and enjoy it as single player as the game limits you to one save file per console.","One island per console is so ridiculous. I bought the game for my TWO children to play. So unhappy with how it plays where one basically can change the island and the other is stranded and forced to watch on. Would never have bought it if I'd read these reviews first. Buyer beware.","Shame on you Nintendo. Granted, I didn't realize research had to be done ahead of purchasing the game to find out that two switches would be required to play the game with my fiance... one island per switch? The menu and loading systems are clunky and frustrating. Waste of 100$. Shame, I really wanted to enjoy this.","My son started the game in the first place, however he lost interest in the game, I have more than 50 hours of play, I will have to start all over again!\rFor when an update so we can change the representative resident Nintendo???","3 personas, 3 juegos, NO COMPR\u00c9IS ESTE JUEGO  si no viv\u00eds solos. \u00danicamente un jugador podr\u00e1 verse involucrado en el juego, los dem\u00e1s tendr\u00e1n menos valor que una piedra, fant\u00e1stico movimiento sucio de Nintendo para fomentar el juego en local, a\u00f1os de desarrollo para conformar pueblos nazis donde solo un jugador tomar\u00e1 las decisiones que tengan que ver con el desarrollo y avance del pueblo.","Don't listen to the crybaby troll reviewers complaining about the game and giving it a nonsensical 0-point score just because they're too broke to buy another Switch for a second island.  Newsflash:  the Switch was always intended to be a personal, one to one device like a smartphone.  NOT intended to service many different people in the same household like a traditional, non-mobile home console, although Nintendo has graciously accommodated some multi-user elements like having multiple user accounts on a single Switch.  But they're not obligated to design games that way.  Don't like it?  Too bad.  Take your broke self to the store and buy another one.  Oh, and the game is a delight.  It doesn't need a narrative or an overarching sense of goals.  It was always intended to be a chill life sim and is absolutely sublime to play.","Very bad: just one island per Nintendo Switch, very sad and unnessary. Fix it with a simple update!","Bought to share with a housemate, only to later find out that only ONE player per console can experience the full game. Doesn't matter if you switch profiles, you can only join the first players island. An absolute joke for those wanting their own experience, which is what this game is about. A blatant move from Nintendo to sell more Switches otherwise forcing you to decide which ONE person gets to enjoy the full game, so much for a family-friendly console eh? Would never have bought this if I had known beforehand.","One island per console sucks! But you know what doesn't suck? The literal rest of the game. Stop review bombing this game, you babies.","Hated can only have one Island. If you have brothers and sisters want to have their own islands. It\u2019s not allowed. You need to buy a different switch.","(First of all just because there's a feature missing, that's not a reason to give a game a flat out 0.) Animal Crossing New Horizons is fantastic. As a new player to the series I was very pleasantly surprised and have found myself playing the game everyday since launch especially due to the quarantine. With the base game content alone I probably would give the game an 8, but due to the fact that they'll be continuing to add content for the next 3 years at least, I have to give the game a 9, and very close to a 10.","Great game and great time killer. All these soyboys making fake reviews need a life. Funny how you MFs have one one review In your profiles.","I think it's pretty unfair to give a game bad score just because it lacks one feature that you'd like it to have. That said, I'm someone who likes to play alone, and I don't need to share my Switch with anyone, so it's not an issue for me. I will also never understand reviews saying the game doesn't have a goal and is therefore lacking. What I see is a game full of endless possibilities where you can spend your time however you want. I love games that don't give you set goals and instead let you roam the world and most importantly, to shape the world to your liking. It's a peaceful paradise that has come at a difficult time for the world and helped heal it, at least for me it did. :)","This game has presented an interesting escape out from quarantine while giving a sense of accomplishment on short daily gameplays.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons offers a relaxing time, with a lot of cute animals with different personalities and amazingly fun gameplay.\r You get to choose your very own island, where you can do whatever you want with it. You can build, decorate, fish, catch insects, dig up fossils, craft and much more.\r While the game offers extremely fun gameplay, a great soundtrack, and a real time system, the multiplayer part of the game is quite a disappointment.\r While the multiplayer part of the game is the only disappointment of the game, since what players can do on other players islands are very limited. By playing it alone, multiplayer won't really ruin the game experience, because of the games so fun gameplay elements.\r With a relaxing soundtrack, and fun gameplay and a interesting real-time system, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a remarkable game.","this is a great game, not the best I've ever played but for what it is (a simulation game) it is a good game","Just here to contradict the unfair zero's. I don't own the game so pay no mind to me.","Great game to play but one island per switch isn't good multiplayer feature. Maybe Nintendo can patch this later on. With that said if your a Animal Crossing fan you will still love this game.","This is by far the greatest game in the series. It adds many things to keep you busy everyday, and even after over a month of game-play it has yet to become boring to me. The game continues to bring fun surprises and charming dialogue. At least 95% of the negative reviews are due to the unfortunate limitation of 1 island per console. Despite this restriction this game is still outstanding and the spam of zeros are simply childish. Yes, it is unfortunate that Nintendo places many arbitrary restrictions on their games but overall the quality is outstanding. I would recommend this game to anyone, especially if you use games to relieve stress.","I personally enjoyed this game but it is most likely because I don't have to share my switch with anyone,  it must be so frustrating having to share a switch with a sibling or your significant other because player 2 will just not be able to enjoy the game like player 1. It was annoying when you had to buy another cartridge to have your own town in the past games but now you can't even do that? No, because Nintendo is money-hungry and wants to suck every last penny from your wallet for no **** reasons, now you have to buy a WHOLE NEW SWITCH which is 300$ instead of 60/40$ like before this is just disgusting. I REALLY hope Nintendo will fix this.","The one island per console is pretty stupid, but I really enjoy the game. Probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same Switch but for me it's not too much of a problem. Really great way to unwind, the Nook Miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now. Kinda wish it wasn't locked to real time but mostly because I'm impatient. I can see myself logging a metric f-ton of time into this game. Good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through Hell in Doom Eternal.","Anything other the first player doesn't get to play the full game and won't ever progress. Either the other players should have the same privilages as the first player, or remove the arbitary one island per consol soft-limit.","I had to change my 9/10 rating to a 10/10 to try and counter balance all the dumb poeple bombing the critics... this is exactly why user critics don't matter, because of salty users.","Best Animal Crossing game in the series! Have played all since the Gamecube, New Horizons builds on the foundations of New Leaf and makes it into an experience that lets you customise your world and play the game how you want to play it. Lots more to keep you engaged than previous games, overall a great experience","I wish that you could island design like you design your room, other than that the game is actually really good and I can\u2019t wait till the next updates!","Great game with some issues like 1 island per switch but I dont really care about that since Im the only one on my switch","I do not understand why you cannot transfer your island from old switch to a new one, it is sooooooooooo dumb that every other game has its data transfer and cloud backup, as for the most time consuming game, AMNH, there is no such option? Now I ending up with 2 switch in my hand and one only being used for ACNH and the new one sitting there soullessly... It\u2019s a punishment for those who accidentally break their switch or just simply wants to change to Lite or a new special edition switch, very good job at earning money but the \u201ceating\u201d image is too greedy and ugly even for Nintendo.... (Imagine you spend 200+ hours and finally collected rare DIYs and now all gone, \u201cwelcome to the new island in the new switch, dumb ass!\u201d Nintendo says:)","I never played the other animal crossing games, but this one blew me out of the water! All those bad reviews are not right. If you just want to relax for a couple of hours you should buy this game.","This game is great &amp; me &amp; my GF have been so excited for it. But the one island per switch &amp; lack of couch co-op makes this game a disaster for anyone who wants to play with someone else. The dream of me &amp; my GF playing together or at least showing each other our islands died rapidly because of this idiotic &amp; money hungry scheme from nintendo &amp; the developer. Fix joy-con drift first &amp; fix the multiplayer of this obvious potential multiplayer made game. I already spent a large amount of money on the switch and its various accessories &amp; controlers. I will not be buying a second one. Just fix the game. Let me play with my GF. It could have been so great... You failed","This game has recently gotten review bombed so ill just say this. Even if your the second account on a switch you still get to experience 90% of the game. True there are some parts at the beginning but I wouldn't say they were anything special. This game is helping a lot of people out right now with current events and is a very fun and calming experience for all ages. People review bombing are selfish and immature. If you haven't reviewed this game yet and you enjoyed the game please write a positive review to counteract the review bombing.","I love the game I picked it up on March 20th and haven\u2019t been able put it down","Honestly only a few tedious things keep this game from a higher rating. It mostly just has to with not being able to craft multiple things at once. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't such a big part of the game. That being said it is an amazing game and a must buy for switch.","Love this game, very smooth a lot of fun stuff to do and all round a great  game. The cloud save issue is enough to not make it a 10/10 but it hardly effects my opinion. If you like chill gaming then definitely get this game.","We\u2019re in the middle of a lockdown and family\u2019s will want to play, and yet only one person gets to experience the full game. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that anyone buys the game until this is changed due to the lack of care for the customers; any other console wouldn\u2019t force the users to purchase another one just so multiple people can play individually. This generation of animal crossing has really disappointed me.","So much fun! I have played most of the animal crossing games and enjoyed them all, but this feels like the pinnacle of the series. So much to do, so many options, and the ability to play however you want! A very cute game that brings all the joy of what we expect from Animal Crossing plus a whole lot more.","Great game. The review bombing is not a fair assessment of the quality of this game","This game is fantastic, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun playing it. It creates very joyful world for you to explore and develop. Only downside is the multiplayer. I know a lot of players were mad being limited to one island per switch console, but I\u2019m actually happy they made it this way. Now I can develop my island with the help of my siblings. However, playing at the same time sucks. One player is the leader which the other players have to follow. I would greatly prefer split screen to this. Great to play solo though.","I liked this game until I realized no one else in my household can create their own island... It's ruined the game.","The game looks amazing and relaxing. You can do many creative things with it, I really enjoyed the game. But the one Island per switch and no backup data sucks. Initially, I thought to rate it 8 or 9 but these things can be easily fixed with an update. Other than that it is an awesome game.","Man.......what is there not to like about this game? I literally can\u2019t put the thing down. I would give it a 10 if it weren\u2019t for the limitations on the switch when it comes to save file transferring and one island per console. But as far as the game itself.......Nintendo struck a home run.","I love this game. You can spend hours doing relaxing things, decorating your house and island. It\u2019s about all I play anymore lol","It\u2019s ridiculous that they only allow one island per each Nintendo Switch. I got the game for myself and my two younger siblings and now only one of us can play as the others don\u2019t want to be the secondary player. Nintendo can make an easy change to allow for a new island for each profile or even add a limit of 2 or 3 islands and plenty of people will be happy. Many people, myself included, think it\u2019s an amazing game but are forced to give it a bad review due to the 1 island limit.","Awesome and beautiful game. Some of the dialog can take a bit to get through, but that's nothing new from the game series. I think with a couple easy quality of life fixes, this game could be perfect.","This game is great for people who need a getaway or just need to be in their own world. There are a few gripes. 1, you can only have one island per console, 2, you have to wait a day before the airport opens, and 3, you can't access the majority of the island when you start and end up having to wait even longer. Other than that. This game has helped me through the COVID-19 pandemic. It's given me a world where I can do what I want and make friends along the way. I can create my own neighborhood and get creative with it. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag and you should pick it up as soon as possible.","Animal crossing is a well designed relaxing game, I have been a fan of the series for a while and find this new entry to be the best yet. The game is extremely well polished with the graphics being quite nice and no bugs that I've seen and the gameplay is immensely fun even if the game did start off quite slow to get into thingsIt did release with a few features from previous games lacking, but Nintendo are showing they're adding in new content regularly and most of what I was missing is being added in. The issue people have with player 1 being in control and everyone locked behind their progression is a genuine concern but is being taken to an extreme level by people, no it's not a 1/10 game","Nintendo needs to learn that they should allow their players the play the way you want (you know like the switches slogan) to play their games. With the recent patches and with the one island policy the person makes the second player or the third player have a worse experience. With the previous installments, it was fine but there are major FLAWS with the current system. You lose so much of the experience is the second player and are restricted in terms of progress if the first player doesn't play the game. I was actually sorry for my sister when I found out she couldn't do so much of what made the game fun. Also, the game got a patch to reduce the interest rate and reduce the spawn rate of rare bugs. They are patching the game to make you play the way THEY want you to play. But, in turn, the game is less fun in my opinion. There should be more quality of life updates rather than them taking away stuff like this because it's so fun to just do what you want and the mundane task of cutting wood is only made worse than the slow crafting system and many inconveniences in the game.","I've had this game since launch and its been over a month now. Its super fun and addictive. It has alot nostalgic value if you played new leaf or older. But i think its so much better. There are some many more things you can do to customize your island. They have a few new characters that are super cute. So far they have not added some of my favorites like Brewster and Katrina. But since they added Leif and redd in the last update, I believe they plan on adding the other missing npcs as time goes on.","This is the game we've been waiting for since New Leaf and while it undoubtedly has problems that could be easily fixed, it's still the shiniest Animal Crossing game that we needed.\r The game is beautiful. The water is s t u n n i n g. The attention to detail is amazing. It's everything.\r Game play is what you'd expect of an Animal Crossing game. Terraforming and crafting are intense. The control given to you literally makes you a god among animals.\r It is a little concerning that there are a lot less features than what we had in base game New Leaf, but the updates will happen and give us a lot more content. If you play this game the way it's intended to be played, it won't slow down. However, since we're all in corona time and going crazy, you might get tired.\r Nintendo has made some baffling choices that they're failing to fix that understandably can break this game for many. One island per console that is basically permanently tied to the console is a huge step back.\r Additionally, minor quality of life changes can also help tremendously, like bulk crafting, dropping multiple items at once, giving more pattern spaces, and cutting extra dialogue we've seen a hundred times (you have to press A on CJ like 40 times each run in the fishing tourney)","Bought this game with my wife. Only found out the island is shared between the switch after payment. This essentially kills both of our ability to play the game. This is a just a blatant money grab by Nintendo. Dont buy it.","One island per switch. Something else could've been done better. They want you to buy another console to play local multiplayer. Please nintendo. Do something about it!","The one island limit is stupid. I can't even play the game, because my brother has his own island, while I don't! The only reason for this is to get people to buy more Nintendo switches, which may I mention cost about 500 dollars right now, which is ridiculous! This is something that Bethesda or EA would do, but I never expected Nintendo to do this. Please fix this Nintendo, I really want to enjoy this amazing in the fullest, without having to pay 500 dollars.","We bought my son the game and he started playing it on the household switch. Well, it looked like a fun game, so I wanted to give it a try. I was super bummed to find out that you can only have one island per console and that, apparently, making an island is a huge part of the gameplay that would be lost if you don't have access to it. I think it is a  ridiculous for nintendo to put on this game. I have the money to buy another console, but am refusing to do so on principal. I won't even buy a lite for this, though I would love to play. Fix this!","One island per console for a whole family. This is a big shame for Nintendo.","The game is fun and i have enjoyed my time playing the game so far. However, not being able to transfer my island to a new switch is ludicrous. Hacking will always be an issue and there is no need need to punish the fans for it. I can live with the cash grab of one island per switch but locking my island to one switch only is ridiculous.","I'm going to start this review by saying Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best entry in the series. There is no doubt in my mind. The creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring. There is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series, not for anything bad for the game, but for how much it has to offer. Where else can they go? The next installment is going to be something I'm afraid of. They might not even come out with one and just update this gem of creativity. I'm afraid I'm not explaining enough, but what I mean is that from each iteration we gain a new customizable feature. From being from a standard town, then to a bigger place with friends being able to visit, then to an even bigger place that has a city element, to being a mayor able to change layouts and buildings and now to a \"god\" as the community jokes about being able to shift the land itself. Hopefully, that explains my concern about the future of this game, where next? This definitely is, in my eyes, the ultimate animal crossing game and has provided millions of people including myself, hours upon hours of relaxing release. As I cross the 350-hour mark, I think its time for me to explain how I felt about the game. As the beginning is slow and may take a lot of time to start feeling like the traditional animal crossing everyone knows, you start understanding how the game is trying to teach you the fundamentals of the new mechanics introduced. It can be frustrating at first if you're the impatient type, but it is well understood the more you play. That's what makes all these negative comments so surprising to read for me. I never have written a review to anything other than amazon products and maybe a youtube comment if you consider that a review of some sorts. I even made an account to just write about this topic. Yes, the game is limited to one island per person. Do not go into this game expecting to have the experience of a maximum of 8 islands on your system. This is apparently is a reason for people to be giving the game a 0 on this site and others as well. Not about the gameplay, or what a good/bad game it is, or even how slow it takes to start as I thought the negative reviews would be about. No, it's about how f you have more than one account on your switch, the others won't be allowed to terraform the island. I cannot think of anyone who would od this other than children or people who are playing Animal crossing for the first time. I don't mean any of those remarks as insults, and I will explain. New leaf, the last game in the series before New Horizons. One player was the mayor, and that's it. Anyone else playing on your 3DS won't have access to those features. If the reasons for that aren't apparent to you, then you don't understand how basic computing and video games work and that's okay. It's okay to not understand something, that's why you should seek the information that you don't understand. Just think about how much memory it would take for the switch to have a maximum of 8 islands with all unique layouts, villagers, and all the other features that make this game the masterpiece that it is. That's not possible to fit on the system itself, therefore it's not a reality. It wasn't for the 3DS, so why is it a problem all a sudden? That's when kids come into the picture. Parents will usually buy one system for the house and each kid wants to have their own island which I completely understand as I would as well as a child. However, does that inherently make it a bad game? Of course not. I have another family member on my island who doesn't have terraforming access as they are the second player to move in. When they want to change something about the island they do one of the possible two things. They either ask me to change it for them, or they log in as me and do it themselves. Oh yeah, did I mention the ability to switch accounts on the switch is Minimalistically seamless? It takes less than 5 seconds to change profiles and start a game. It's fine to criticize a game, but it's downright insane to mass bad review a game for system limitations when the problem has nothing to do with the gameplay its self. If I'm the wrong one for feeling this way then so be it, I'll stand alone. Is Nintendo just doing this to sell more consoles? Most definitely not, however, I don't think they are complaining that this is an \"issue\". Then that gets into the problem of how the bad reviews may affect Nintendo, but it hurts the animal crossing franchise more. People will see the negative source for consumers and assume it's just another game that critics love and the public didn't, further greatening the divide between creators and fans. I really don't know what to say at this point other than how disappointing it is to see the gaming culture turn into this immaturity and not appreciate the art that countless artists spent years creating.","This is my first time playing Animal Crossing, and it is very addicting! Very fun to play and there is always something to do. I understand why people are upset about the one island per console, but they shouldn't give this game a low rating because of it. The graphics are amazing and the animations are cute, but something I hate is that the tools always break.. it ruins the fun and I have to go build new tools which isn't relaxing at all. But overall, the game is amazing to play especially during this pandemic, it takes your mind off of things. If you're not sure whether or not to get this game, I was once in your shoes, and I bought the game because all of my friends had it. Now I absolutely love the game.","It\u2019s an adorable experience that constantly surprises, euphoric in the satisfaction it provides with each mechanic, no matter how big or small.","To be super honest without even considering the one-character restriction, this game is overhyped. Yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute, but this game for some reason doesn't really make me want to binge play it. Maybe it was designed like that on purpose, with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped. But overall, this isn't a game I would stay up playing.

And no cloud saves yet. Great game otherwise.","Great game for people who want a calm game to relax to. I love this game it\u2019s great online play works well. It may not be for everyone only people who like slower pace games mostly because this game has full 24h days so you can\u2019t sleep till the next day.","Never log out this game since the day I get the copy of catridge. It\u2019s been one month continuously. Great game!","I dont mind the one island per console cause I own my own Nintendo but as a fast paced player usually playing games like Call of duty, pokemon etc etc I don't find this game interesting to me, I know its made for everyone but now I'm about 2 days in and have nothing to do its really boring, I have heard though you get interesting features within a week which isn't my thing but other people like, I'm only giving a 5 because the graphics are nice and that its a relaxing game but way too slow paced for me to like but others do, anyways I'm 50/50.","One of the best experiences i had on the switchIt is calm and relaxing but is also very interesting, there is a lot to do in this game.The graphics are amazing and playing this game is just a wonderful experience. People are giving this game a 1 just because you can only have one island per console, yeah it is annoying but is nothing compared to the greatness of this game.","A fantastic game to play during quarantine. Don't listen to the neck beard simp virgins review bombing this game","This game could have been a contender for game of the year 2020 if it didn\u2019t shoot itself in the foot by limiting itself by 1 island per console. If you are alone this is a must buy, but if you share a console with anyone skip this game.","I\u2019ve currently been playing this game for a very short amount of time, and while it is enjoyable I as many others feel the companies inclination to make a one island limit and then significantly decrease the overall involvement the subsequent players on the island have is very reminiscent of what we\u2019ve seen from greedier establishments in the past. I merely want my girlfriend to have the same privileges I do on them game, representative or not.","One island per console is a shame! Multiples profiles is a very basic \"feature\" that's not work in this game...","I wish i could go back and not get this game.  Its 'leader' system coupled with its 1 island per console has this game collecting dust 5 days after purchase as my family members one by one give up out of boredom, no ability for secondary players to advance the game, only do chores. Big freaking whoop.  The leader is then left with all the grind.  Having to collect so many resources and get out of so much island debt leaves the leader unable to pursue their own ambitions.  This game is so lifelike in a bad way that it leaves me dreading it like i dread my real mortgage.  Nintendo will not likely fix or patch or update this, don't hold your breath.  If this game was 20 or 30 dollars, i'd have written an entirely different  review.  I expect full capability for ALL my family members when i buy a game at full market price.","One island limit means you get a watered-down game with no substance if you're not the first player. I really hope they change this so I can actually enjoy the game to its full potential.","A good game, but a terrible Animal Crossing.A delayed game in the makings for a decade left unfinished and soulless in comparison to other games in the series. Newcomers don't know how much was left out. I don't want content to be slowly released to the public. I want to buy the finished game I've waited for years.","An enjoyable game overall, but many small issues which adds up and becomes annoying.The fact that you need to pay 10$ monthly to visit friends or ever send them gifts etc is almost as bad as the whole deal with the first person who plays the game is the one who decides everything in the game.I also think the villagers dialoge is fairly week. It's apperant quickly if you have two of one character type on the island, and it gets old quick. There are more things I can bring up, but these are the ones that bring down my enjoyment the most","Juego incre\u00edble que en menos de 6 semanas ha conseguido vender m\u00e1s de 13 millones y ha sido por algo. Es un juego donde puedes hacer hacer de todo y que no tiene l\u00edmites a la hora de editar tu pueblo en tu imaginaci\u00f3n.Yo no se porque el juego ha recibido tantas cr\u00edticas aqu\u00ed en Metacritic, si es que lo vuelvo a decir \"Es un juego incre\u00edble\".  No se porque tanta cr\u00edtica diciendo tonter\u00edas como: Es limitado, no se pueden crear tantas cosas, solo una isla por juego... Excusas de idiotas.Como se nota que esto ha sido un boicoteo en condiciones, pero han fallado los labradores de barra de otras empresas. Suerte en la pr\u00f3xima que Nintendo se esta ba\u00f1ando en billetes gracias a este juego.","Best game of this year. Awesome new graphics super , so relaxing, new feature Nook miles is cool.","As a person who has only played 15 hrs of New Leaf and got bored of it, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an amazing game. I got to find out myself when people said that there are endless things to do and really you are the only limit realistically. The game is designed to be relaxing and calming, as well as interesting. There are many key things that I think people really click with in this game. The villagers, who all have a unique look and vibe to them, the clothing is amazing, with hundreds of clothing items to buy, you'll have a hard time finding just one perfect outfit, the island terraforming is a breath of fresh air to the series and is done in a simple and non complicated way. Nothing in this game feels off or out of theme. The difficulty curve is small, but part of the fun is learning along the way. The online play is really good, there are some things to fix, but for what it is, I think it's really nice. There is much more to say about the game, but overall it is fun and unexpectedly addictive, while being cute and simple at heart!","The Switch was largely marketed as a family console, but only one person in the household can have fun playing Animal Crossing because of the ridiculous 1 island per Switch restriction. Returned the game and the Switch. Screw Nintendo.","Bought this to play with my wife. Couldn't seem to get advancement quests, then I found out online that I will never be able to, since my wife started the game first, and the island is now permanently her game, and I'm just there to grind resources for her quests. Read up on the Resident Representative restrictions. They are a disgusting cash grab where Nintendo wants you to buy a SWITCH per player, with their own copy of the game each, to get the BASIC experience of play. Unacceptable. **** Nintendo.","Is this a joke or what? If the game was being sold for 5$ it may be a good choice to spend some minutes sitting on the WC instead of reading the back of shampoos and any kind of bathroom fauna but a full price for this? It is just a mobile phone game with all the bad parts of it; small, lack of content andhorrible timing. Collect these five stones. Wait for tomorrow to do it again. Oh, wait, you need 300 stones to continue. Good luck. I can't even imagine how many thousands Nintendo had to pay to the media to receive this score. Gross.","Plenty of improvements, fun overall. The one island per console limitation is ridiculous. This is a family game. Why would there be one person who can progress and the rest of the family can run errands? People are missing out on the fun for no reason. I can't possibly recommend this game until this issue is addressed.","Well, as an Animal Crossing fan since Wild World times, I must say this last installment is quite the pinnacle for the saga. It is quite complete, from my opinion, and though it is not a revolutionary game for the saga, it evolves every game mechanic and adds a lot of new features. The personalisation introduced in New Leaf  goes into a new level, with the option of building your island from scratch, placing furniture outside the house, the paths... For the fans, all of these are great news. The Nook Miles system, although I do not personally see it as \"bad\", I found it a bit tedious (from a very personal point of view), but it helps to try to have like a daily routine in our island. You can spend hours and hours without notice, and that is a very positive thing to say.\r About negative points, I must say I have little complains about this game. Maybe there are too few shops (compared to New Leaf) and the fact that we can only play the events (Easter, Nature Day...) during the real days (and after the final day, if time travel back, they are not activated again) are my main complains. And about the great amount of zeros due to 1 island per console, although is a thing  that can prevent someone from not giving this game a 10 (I include myself in this group), I think it is too exaggerated to rate it a zero. And with the fact that most of the users rating this game a zero are users which only rate has been this game, I think Metacritic should act and help to give this game a rate which really deserves (nor a 5.2, either a 10, possibly a 8.5-9).\r In conclusion, buy this game if you have a Switch. Animal Crossing New Horizons must not be ignored if you want to have a complete Switch catalog.","I have played all the games in the series and this one is my favorite. Lots to do, charming art. I keep playing each days since day one.","Let me and my gf play on 2 separate save files. this is a clear attempt to sell more consoles rather then selling the experience of playing animal crossing. I really just wanted to make my own Island and do my own thing. I've never played any animal crossing and was looking forward to experiencing it on my own. I absolutely hate that I cannot make 2 separate save files and do things on my own. Worst $80 i ever spent. Neither my girlfriend nor I play anymore because we both wanted our own experience so we are arguing over every change. If we each had our own island this would be fixed in an instant. I don't even mind starting from scratch. I just want to make my own virtual \"Zen Garden\" without anybody elses influence or input. Especially as my first experience with the game. so disheartening and really just makes me wish I never bought the game.","I can't recommand the game right now at it's State... This game Will bring disapointment in your family as the second players feel like a **** on the Island... Metacritic should really be lower then this too just for that reason...Any can't even get a refund... F*$# Y&amp;@ NINTENDO!FIX THIS","I suppose it's a great solo game but if you are more than 1 people with 1 console it's unplayable. The first one to play take the resources to craft a couple of tools and the other player doesn't have resouces to do anything. You have to wait 24 hours for the resources to respawn  To be able to play if you are 3 players you have to play 1 day on 3 to let everyone grab their resources. That's really a shame to transform 1 of the favorite Nintendo game into a game that you have to buy 1 console by game copy........","I wanted to love this game, but its not a game made for family , its made for people who lives alone who share no social contacts, the fact that only one instance of the game play can exist in a console is just overwhelmingly stupid and arguably the most arrogant and greedy thing ever since nintendo history. the only option to have 2 people play the game is to either buy a new console for the other and a new copy of the game, or delete the first player\u2019s account.i wish i could return this, people should be outrage because of this... i simply can not believe the score of reviews, anyone giving this more then 5 is biased, because it\u2019s half a game.","LIMITED, IS GOOD BUT I CAN'T CREATE A 2ND ISLAND AND IF YOU COMPARE TO STARDEW VALLEY OR MINECRAFT IT FALLS SHORT.\rPD- I HATE MARSHAL AND RAYMOND","i try to play this game, but i really don't like it.

What has the development team been doing for 7 years? Please return \"Animal Crossing\" that everyone loved !!!","Multiplayer is a rubbish joke. Great let down for my kid who though we could play together. Absolutely not worth it for this.","As long as there is only one island per switch this game doesn't deserve anything less than a 0. Great potential but it is nothing more than a polished f*ck you towards every parent with more than 1 kid. bought it for my sister and my niece and nephew not knowing this was the case. (my sister is on welfare and can't but it herself for the kids) So now I'm either stuck buying another one or them selling it cause it causes problems for obvious reasons. If a second island would require a second version of the game, fair play, but a whole extra console? The sales department at Nintendo has been on some strong stuff to come up with this crap. Shame on you Nintendo, shame on F*ing you.","WARNING: You can only have 1 island per switch console. So if you have multiple players in the house, you have to share the island. Not a bad thing in itself, but the special tasks to expand the island, add new residents, etc is limited to the first player who set up the island.

I bought Animal Crossing and seems like a great game...until my kids found out it was one island per console???? with 3 kids at home.!!

Never taught I would see this about your compagnie but during this pandemic stay at home moment you should think more human and not only about $$$$$ Sorry for bad english,it is not my native language.","Only allowing one island per console is terrible and Nintendo should be ashamed of the state this game is in. Storytime: two days before launch, I read about this one island policy and was terrified. I don't have a lot of money, so my girlfriend and I share a switch and don't buy many games. She doesn't play much, so I was thrilled when Animal Crossing was announced because it looks like her type of game. Fast forward to me learning about the island, and I expressed my concerns to her. She said to me that it would be okay and we would just share. To my dismay, sharing is not an option. Only the primary player can progress the game. Any big progression moments must be done only by the one player. Any additional players just have to exist and not partake in progression. That is evil. This is the worst thing I've seen from Nintendo. I played for two hours and decided to stop and let my girlfriend play. Again, I couldn't believe how terribly the second player is treated. No new resources spawn for each player. I only played for two hours and it was enough for it to be impossible for her to progress in any capacity. She has now decided she will never play again because she tried to play but wasn't able to since she hit a complete brick wall after ten minutes. We tried to figure it out on the second day, and ultimately this game is not compatible with multiple players. If you are the only person on the switch, this game is great. If you have anyone else at all who playsthe console, the game does not work. I'm giving this a 0/10 because of how disappointed and sad my girlfriend is. Games should not bring this much upset to anyone. Games are to enjoy, not to make you miserable. Nintendo is evil. This game is terrible. I hope they patch it out but I know they won't. Nintendo is just as evil as EA.","No way for me to experience the full game unless I go on someone else's account (and even then There's still stuff i'd miss out on). The shared island and representative systems single-handedly ruin the game.","I bought this game for my daughter, then had to buy a second copy and also a second console for my wife. Pure cash grab. 100% greed. Oh, and by the way Nintendo, congrats, it worked.","A fantastic little game that will eat up your spare time. Whether it be decorating your home, growing and tending your garden, socialising, adventuring, shopping, teraforming the landscape, crafting or interacting with the wildlife, Animal Crossing has something for everyone.The game works in real time so times of days, seasons, deliveries, and events change depending on what's happening in the real world. This creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make. There are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better. Islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is ESSENTIAL to progression. All in all a wonderful game and highly recommended.","Only one Island per console is a huge drawback for me. I expected more freedom from the series' debut on the Switch. I hope Nintendo solves this problem with a patch in the near future.","This game is absolutely amazing! Everyone review bombing this game doesn\u2019t even know what Animal Crossing is. Just a bunch of wannabe critics. Do they play Call of Duty and wish the game had less shooting? Do they play Minecraft and wish it had better graphics? Probably. The music is great, the adventure is great. Multiplayer is wonderful. And the ease to switch between characters when playing couch co-op? Perfect. Reminds me of the good ol days playing GameCube. Every day there\u2019s something new. Can\u2019t wait for the Easter events!","This game is amazing, it's a beautiful psychological therapy and gives you only good vibes.Don't consider the bad reviews about the fact you can only have one island per console, we already know it and we are fine with it, it actually makes sense to enhances local co-op","One save per console and local coop is somehow worse than playing alone. The second player cannot even access his/her inventory and if p2 is fishing and p1 opens its inventory the fish will disappear. A shared camera view with the zoomed in camera demands that you stick together, but there is rarely anything for two players to do on the same screen. P2 just tags along and watches, while also causing an annoyance for p1 because the camera view is shared. I bought this game to play with my gf and I wish I could return it now.","I was super excited about this game until I discovered that you can only have one island per Switch. Player 2 can't progress until player 1 does. Lame!","No support for multiple users is completely unacceptable in 2020. I love Nintendo but this really needs to stop.","Guys.... Not giving the ability to create more than one island per Switch is moronic and greedy as hell. This game has some terrific qualities and is the perfect game for people with all the current world events going on, but restricting access like this has to be the dumbest move I\u2019ve seen a game company make this year. I\u2019m not going to spend another $360+ to use the Switch in the way it SHOULD work. What makes matters worse is that Switches aren\u2019t even available in many cities in the US due to the disruption of the supply chain. Nicely done Nintendo!","BEST GAME OF MY LIFE!!!! THIS GAME IS THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN, PERFECT GRAPHICS, PERFECT GAMEPLAY, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT, but if you see some negative reviews is why they didn't feel the classic game that was your friend play and advance some parts and that's a good and nostalgic thing. So my grade is 10/10","This is just my Happy place game along with breath of the wild and Fire emblem three houses, all relaxing and chill, nothing about it feels unfinished or not fun, everything feels like it belongs in animal crossing and easily took over my life in the last few hours, and I know it won\u2019t wear off","This game is great, I\u2019d give it a 9/10.  Gave it a 10 for the nonsensical people ever thinking this was a true multiplayer experience.  It\u2019s literally the only complaint about the game and people are giving it zero\u2019s.  One ridiculous comment I saw \u201cSwitch is a family-friendly console, this is not a family-friendly game.  Instant zero.\u201d The game doesn\u2019t even let you name your character something obscene.  You can report COMPUTER NPCs for being semi-inappropriate.  How is it not family-friendly? Have y\u2019all never played the game before? It\u2019s a SINGLE-PLAYER LIFE SIM.  It always has been and it always will be.  The fact you can go visit others\u2019 islands in itself is a huge victory. I\u2019m really enjoying this game.  The crafting is great, the tiered crafting is pretty cool too.  The museum looks amazing compared to past games and I want to catch EVERYTHING! Nook miles are an interesting add, weird, but nothing too essential has been sold there thus far, and what has I\u2019ve been easily able to get the miles for. Heck, I had over 10,000 miles within a few hours and I was playing leisurely (as it\u2019s meant to be played).I forgot the thing runs in real time, so it forces you to take breaks unless gathering and crafting and selling are your cup o\u2019 tea.  Other games call in the meantime.  Great experience thus far about 15-20 hours (play time) in. Again, if you bought this and expected it to be a full multiplayer experience, you clearly didn\u2019t know enough about the game and shouldn\u2019t have bought it.  Your fault. End of story.  I recommend everyone check this amazing game out.  Hundreds of hours of entertainment.","I don't like how you have to go to the airport to send postcards :(\r umm character limit filler...","The graphics, the gameplay loop, the music, the personalization options, the dialogues are all really charming.

Packed with new and interesting content, it is something worthwhile for\u00a0individuals\u00a0looking forward playing the next series of Animal Crossing. Recently, they showcased so much information on Animal Crossing Direct, and there were exciting things we can do. For instance,\u00a0the ability of\u00a0being able to terraform and\u00a0waterscape\u00a0the land, achievements, 8 players online, customizations, and so on. While playing it, one of the honorable mentions was the writing itself, which\u00a0may be referred to as the character\u2019s dialog. Because they were willing to add variety of words when they talk, it seems enjoyable and natural to go talk with different characters in the game. However, there are downsides. You might have only one island per console, which means you cannot have multiple islands in the game. Besides, the incapable of not supporting cloud-saves. It needs\u00a0to be\u00a0supported, so people won\u2019t get their internal data lost. Although, the game fully meets expectations with a good gameplay in which it\u00a0is intended\u00a0for hardcore audiences.

Other players that have accounts on the same console are extremely limited to what they can do.Nintendo has said before that they wanted everyone in a household to have their own switch and it looks like this is one of the many ways they plan on doing it. All under the guise of \"to prevent cheating\" even though the main way people cheat is changing the internal clock on their system and they're already doing it.","It's 2020 and I will have to share the island with my brother. I just want to know why nintendo did such a thing, it's like they're telling us to enjoy the game the way THEY want","I have to rate this game a 0 like many others have said for the same reason is you cannot have more than one island per switch.  The local multiplayer is a joke.  The first person that does the tasks,  gets the rewards and everyone else don't get share that joy. If you can have 4 people on an island on local coop and 8 people with online multiplayer visit your island.  There is no reason why this game cannot be patched to give the same experience to everyone.\r its the same story as others have mentioned already.\r Nintendo the year is 2020 not 1985.  Multiple game saves do exist.  The Nintendo Switch do have on board memory and a SD card slot for extra storage. No worries it can handle it!\r Nintendo have designed Animal crossing this way.  They did this on purpose to force people to buy hardware and a second copy of the game. shameful. Other than that is is a great game, too bad its not equal for everyone.\r Here's how the game should work with a single switch : Johnny signs in with his Nintendo profile,  Plays Animal Crossing,  does his tasks and game progression.  once done Jane signs in with her profile, Plays Animal Crossing, does her tasks and game progression.\r Want to play on the same island together? no problem,  Choose which Island you want to play on and  when the 2nd player visits they can take some resources with them to share. Both can continue to play together and farm resources that they can keep or trade.  Sounds simple, but Nintendo don't want it that way.\r Bottom Line is :  To truly enjoy this game multiplayer you need two Nintendo Switches and two copies of the game.","Una isla por consola en 2020....One island per console in 2020....uma ilha por console em 2020...2020\u5e74\u306b\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3054\u3068\u306b1\u3064\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9....eine Insel pro Konsole im Jahr 2020...un'isola per console nel 2020...","I spent months counting down to getting this game. I love playing Animal Crossing. But so does my girlfriend, and with one shared switch that means one of us is basically a glorified NPC. One person gets a game, the other gets to visit. And if players don't share the same island preferences, too bad, only Player 1 matters.\r I'm sure Nintendo meant for situations like mine to get people buying another switch, but instead it's just killed the game for me.","Hope you aren't the second resident. You're not gonna like it. I can't believe they handled this so poorly...","The 2 players experience is terrible. I would recommand this game to a person with no friends, or family.","Awesome game.    The best Animal Crossing so far!","This is a great game. Don't listen to the review bombers this is the best AC game ever.","Made an account just to review this game to help raise awarness and hopefully get this fixed. The reason I say \"fixed\" is because it is unbelievable that this was the intention of the developers and Nintendo. The game is great as a single player experience, even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help her progress.Everything changes though when you want to try having your own animal crossing experience on your account. The game locks you into one island per switch, so whatever creative descisions the first player made is stripped from the second player.You cannot place buildings or structures, donate to the museum, or unlock more DIY tools or construction kits. You are locked by the progress of the first player, even though you are on a completely different profile. The only way out of this is to give Nintendo more money by purchasing a new Switch console. Yes thats right, want the full experience of this game for yourself but can't because someone started playing the game on the Switch first, for the mere price of a whole new console you can have that $60 on release game experience for only about 5x the cost of the game originally, thanks Nintendo, you have basically locked the gane into being a hard 1 game per console and advertising it as a fun multiplayer experience where everyone gets to help make an island together. Instead you have that experience for only one player and all the other accounts on your console are just along for the ride. No one should have to suffer a paywall this high, poor business practices and this game deserves every negative rating it gets until this is fixed. 0/10 a masterpiece only 1 person in your household can enjoy.","PLEASE IGNORE UNFAIR REVIEWS ABOUT THE 1 TOWN PER CONSOLE ISSUE THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE!

Had we known, I'm not sure if we would have bought it.  It's causing hard feelings in my household.","It is hugely disappointing that the game only allows a single island.  My kids have been counting the days for this game to arrive (267 days of counting and waiting!!!!). One child played for a bit and the other got ready to play and then discovered they could not create their own island.  While the game play itself is fun and well designed this is a major weakness. With no warning at the outset of play that only a single island will be available.  Nintendo really needs to remedy this.","Nice game, but what should this be with only one island an account! My wife and I, we love the former games, playing together in different villages, but now? But this is really disappointing. I hope, the will change it it asop.","It's just a typical mobile grind-game with time-wall. And poor interface. Worst game of the year.","Game is solid, i'am giving a 10 because of the unfair review bombing. Otherwise i for me its a 9/10.","I started this game without great expectations, and it ended up being an extremely relaxing experience.\rYou will not be able to do everything in one day, the game waits for you to come in daily and connect to play. For this reason I highly recommend having a digital version.\rThe issue of having only one island per console takes away some points, but in my case I do not share my console with other people because it is not a problem.\rIf you are in quarantine like I recommend I take a look at this game.","The core game is as good as it always was: talk to animals, catch bugs and go fishing while collecting furniture and expanding your house.\r However: this is the most contentless Animal Crossing since the original. Almost 90% of content, meaning shops, activities, items and NPCs from New Leaf and other entries is missing. It's honestly barren and boring compared to older titles.\r This is a huge step back for the franchise.","Great game.Cute npcs and graphics.Who cares about sharing Switch since I am rich enough to buy a new one for my family. LOL","bad reviews for this game are only complains by people which probably even haven't played ac nh.\rthis game is so fun and relaxing to play alone or with friends, and they added much new things","Really fun game! It's a nice change of pace from all the run and gun type of games that have been coming out lately. Haven't had a self-paced game this interesting since I played Stardew Valley. There's always something new to explore, things to upgrade and decorate. It's sad that people are complaining that there's no \"objective\" to obtain or arrive at are obviously new to Animal Crossing and didn't understand what they were getting into. That's like a fan of action movies going to watch a romance movie and then rating it low because there was no action in it...\r AC:NH has charming graphics, the iconic dialog speech patterns, and plenty to see and do for the hardcore fans of the series. I never played the other games but this one immediately hooked me into playing every single day. I'm hoping for expansions to the island sizes as the starting areas are pretty small.","I hate cry babies reviews bombing, but by the way it's a good game in my humble opinion.","It is an AWESOME GAME, I'm playing with my girlfriend, all in the same island and we're loving it to pieces.","Im not citizen rep so I dont get to actually play the game. What exactly were they thinking about besides more copies equal more money.","I really don't  understand why so many people just show negative view towards the Animal Crossing.If you want to explore full version of the game,Just BUT ONE MORE Nintendo Switch.

You have always been made to share a town with others in your home, I don't understand the haters. Thumbs up from me.","Listen i know people are reviewing bombing animal crossing new horizons bc of its co-op player system and its one island per console but like other than that its pretty good","Game is great, I literally can\u2019t stop play it lol, the people purposely leaving horrible reviews over one or two things that can be changed with updates and ignoring everything good the game has to offer are simply being immature","Please, please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and ignore the obnoxiously low ratings you see around the internet and actually read up on the history of this game.  Animal Crossing has always been a 1 island per console/game. The way this game is presented to you is nothing new or out of the ordinary from previous games.That being said, the actual review: My wife and I have taken turns passing the controller back and forth for a combined 48 hours now and we're loving every minute.  Do things get repetitive? Yes, they can.  Do you run out of things to do? Yes, you can.  Is that any reason to not play this game?  No not at all.  This game is everything we've waited for, and more. We're going to happily play this game every day we possibly can, through every season we possibly can, and for AS LONG as we possibly can.","Made an account just to say this games great, love sharing an island with my fiancee.  Together, we can power through collecting resources and we get to share the joy of having the same villagers.","So I made this post cause I felt this is a worthy sequel to new leaf and has added and built off previous ideas.  That being said I dont care for the tools breaking but I understand it and have even learn the system more.  I don't hold issues with the one island per console as it makes sense as the house can have their own singular Island.The new temp 1 off islands make for a fresh way to find new critters as Well as find some villagers.  There is also new ways to trade and buy items as Well as new ways to build stuff you want.","This game is literally the best in the entire Animal Crossing series, ignore the review bombers. You have more control over the customization of your village than EVER before, and it does have a \"deserted island\" feel to the game until you give it your own spin and begin to find a comfortable spot in your island. My friends and I have had nothing but fun times on this game playing together so far (even though it is admittedly young in its life) and its helping several through the quarantine. Ignore the people that are being whiny little babies, please, I implore you. Nintendo legitimately worked hard on this game and pumped out a game that is, in my mind, one of the greatest games on the switch so far. From crafting to being able to be knocked out by several more bugs to many of our special character favourites returning, this is a VERY good addition to the series, and I would almost say perhaps my favourite one yet.","Forget the multiplayer issue, why is no one talking about how bare bones and overall trash this game is?\rIt has strayed from the original AC formula so much that I don't even want to play it anymore. All of the Pocket Camp integrations have been annoying and stressful; completely taking away from the game.\r There's pressure to fill the residents home with furniture or else they won't move in, there's pressure to continuously build tools that break extraordinarily quickly.\r And the hourly music is AWFUL!!!  I just play with my switch turned all the way down with older AC game OST playing in the background.\r I'm overall so disappointed in this game that I could barely give it one star. The only thing it has going for itself is the graphics.","A fantastically relaxing game that is super engrossing. I recommend having other games to play while you wait for things to be built because half the fun of the game is feeling that the Island is actually alive with real events that take time. On the box of the game, it tell you how only one island is allowed per console. Review bombing the game over something that is displayed on the box, isnt a fair. Definitely hope this issue is fixed, but as someone who plays alone on my console, it's not worth ignoring how great the game is.","first of all its worth pointing out that this is in fact an Animal Crossing game, you either \" get it\" or you don't. Animal Crossing is a gentle life simulator and relaxation game. It's not for everybody.  That said, like each new main release in the series this one is the best Animal Crossing yet. If you like Animals Crossing you don't need anyone to tell you whether or not to buy it. You wanna get this game.","1-No major objectives2- Visiting other players islands is nightmare the games stops with everyone going in and out!3- you will get bored after two days of playing4- no multiplayer unless you have Nintendo online subscription","Truly a great game.\r With a terrible local multiplayer system... For a console like a Switch...\r Well, not exactly The \"Multiplayer\"...\rLook\rYou have an island. One per console. For all five possible accounts.\r Just one island. This means that daily resources (from rocks and trees, and some plants) are limited either for just one player or split between all players.\r But that's not everything. The only person that can actually progress the whole island further is the first player, the one that created the island. Other players depend on him. (Imagine having no idea about that, and letting a 6-year-old kid play it first) (Not my problem, thankfully)\r Not only progress, even managing the island is the privilege of the primary player.\r Alright. So if this game is designed this way, maybe players are supposed to play together?-\r-Hah, of course not! First of all - no split-screen. Second of all, everything depends on the group leader. Secondary players can only run around him, do some stuff, but their inventory is non-existent until they get the leadership (meanwhile everything they got as secondary players gets stuck in a limited-size box owned by the player who was a group leader)\r ...\rHave I told you the story of how I ruined the first impression for my older brother, who technically was the first player, but I was the first to actually play the game once the island was created, and I was the one to collect all the available resources...\r //Yeah, I was wondering, why couldn't I progress any further for the last couple of days. So I made quick research... Turns out that's why our experience was so much worse than it should have been//\r ...Game is good, I agree on that part. But there is one problem. Because I and my brother share one Switch, neither I nor he can enjoy it entirely. And after some time we will get to a point, where I'm not getting all of the content the game has just because I am a secondary player.","You are forced to buy the game 2 times if u share the switch with others. your progress is capped by the player who start the game first.","Animal Crossing is one of the best franchises under Nintendo's belt, and New Horizons is no different. Plenty to do, and explore. Between crafting, island exploration, and just enjoying the scenery, this game is amazing. This is my first Animal Crossing game, and I'm enjoying everything about it.The only downside is 1 island per Switch, not a problem for me as I'm the only switch player in my house, but it may be for others.","I'm playing with my girlfriend. Built my house, collected some stuff, done... Please add a island for every user on the switch console.","One Island per console thats ridiculous. If I knew I wouldn't buy it. I won't support this dev in future, thats for sure.","You cannot do anything together story wise if your friends are with you. Also one island tether is not fun for party play. If stardew can do it so can you.","I am second player and nothing to do.  Totally un acceptable for a 80$ game!!!","Best Animal Crossing game hands down, graphics are gorgeous and gameplay is addicting as always (the moment I was able to pick objects up, I spent an hour picking up weeds XD) So many trolls talking about a horrible co-op experience, more than likely mislead because they don't research a game before they buy it, they just buy into the hype. This game lives up to the hype for this long time Animal Crossing fan. The co-op experience reminds me of the good ol' DS days. I haven't gotten too far into it yet, but I am already addicted and see myself coming back to the island every day, even if it is for a short amount of time. Also, I am the only person on my console playing this game, and I don't time skip because I am a patient person along for the experience. Thank you Nintendo, sorry people are review bombing your game because they clearly didn't watch all of the videos you put forth in preparation for the game.Update 4/4/2020: This game has officially consumed my life. With the coronavirus bs going on and everything closing, this allows me to \"hang out\" with friends and family. It scratches the itch for social interaction, and I literally cannot stop playing this. Soooo much customization, you can literally recreate your entire island. This game deserves a much better user score than what it has,  I would say at the lowest an 8.5.","People, stop freaking out about the whole 1 town, 1 switch thing. Honestly, you probably have two switches/ switch lites if you really want to play with anyone in your family. Everyone is just looking at the game\u2019s one multiplayer flaw and immediately giving it a zero. No one is looking at the game by itself, and I see a extremely polished Animal crossing game that me and my brother are having a blast with. There are some quality of life issues, for example selling stuff doesn\u2019t let you select multiple items to sell at a time( same with buying), but those can be easily overlooked. It\u2019s probably one of the best looking switch games, and the music is phenomenal! Definitely a game you can really sink your teeth in until Nintendo eventually gives us another great game to play. I haven\u2019t gotten to try out the online yet, but it does look really fun going to your friends islands and helping them too. Hopefully this has convinced you to get this game, and don\u2019t listen to the whinerscomplaining about one problem who don\u2019t see the game for what it truly is.","Ich liebe alles an diesem Spiel. Auch das neue Craften ist so eine gute idee gewesen. Die Musik ist auch wie in allen Vorg\u00e4ngern sch\u00f6n und beruhigend. Es f\u00fchlt sich einfach an ein perfektes Spiel","1. Crafting is extremely poor - really basic combinations without meaningful depth.\r2. Interactions aren't good either - chop wood, gather some fruits, go fishing - its no better than simple game from Appstore\r3. BE AWARE, BECAUSE IT'S A NIGHTMARE! - Annoying animations. Did you catch the same butterfly for the 20-th time? It doesn't mather - you are forced to watch same freaking animation \"yes, I catched it, wow!\". Would you like to sell something? It's good but everytime you are forced to read the same text all over again. It's going to be like 1000 times throughout whole game.\rYou can play it, but be aware that whole bunch of your time would be consumed by meaningless conversation, and animations you cant skip. Without any award","That's a fantastic game, the beat animal crossing since the first hours player i can't ask something better","As this was my first Animal Crossing, I had my hopes high. Perhaps even higher than reasonable. But thankfully, months of hype and a pre-order didn't go to waste, as this is already one of my favorite switch games. Thanks, Nintendo, for another great game!","This game is already a 20/10 just playing less than 5 hours. It\u2019s already blown new leaf out of the waters.","After some hours of playing,i can say my opinion.its a good game,its really relaxing,and with this game you can take a break.this game is really good in this period because of the quarantine.the bad thing is that at the very first hours you can't explore that much because of the 2 rivers; also this game is not for everyone,not everyone can appreciate this game.but anyway,its a really good game.it has some really good graphics and i didn't see any graphic problem.so yeah,i reccomend this.(p.s this game is is even better with headphones!relaxing music+high quality sound effects is the best!you should try if you have some headphones.)","As a vetern New Leaf player, I really enjoy this recent release. Its really relaxing and fun to play each day. This type of game isn't for binging in one sitting, it takes time to fully play it.\r Defo recommend it for any switch owner!","A 0. I bought a Nintendo Switch just for this cause all their other games are terrible. But ti turns out this one is terrible as well. It looks horrific, ultra low quality and of course 1080p. The Switch itself is a nightmare to use, max 5mbps downloads bad connections etc. Multiplayer is done horrific, takes forever to play with someone and when you do you wonder why? There is nothing to do, just a slow and boring nerd game. So sad I wasted 400euro on a console that performs worse than an iPhone and with barely any games on it.\r Edit update: I sold the switch for 430eur so no loss. The game is SEVERELY limited and bottle necked by the Switch's terrible hardware. Load screens inside load screens lmfao. Got a new room in your house? Nice load screen, so sad. Hit boxes are so huge you feel like playing Minecraft. Place a lamp and you can't walk around for 1 meter lol... It's a mediocre game at best, but of course the Nintendo fanboys think it's the best thing ever.","Uninspired, unoriginal and any other poor adjective you can think of. The game has developed a disgusting cult following that will avidly defend the game even if it came out with trees reminiscent of trees running on the N64 (which would probably look better than this game).  Unlike Pokemon Sword and Shield, this game doesn't have the same pull that drags you away from your every day life.","IF YOU DID YOUR DID RESEARCH YOU WOULD KNOW YOU CAN ONLY HAVE 1 ISLAND PER CONSOLE. Same as every other game. Don't review bomb because you can't read.","The fact that I cannot buy two different games at least to have a different island than the rest of my family is ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing if it wasn\u2019t so Only the First Player gets to upgrade things. It\u2019s disgusting because I\u2019ve been sitting with an underdeveloped island for days while my younger sibling got the favoritism of my parents so they were allowed to make the first character and now the villagers have been in tents for 5 days!!! All because they don\u2019t want to play as often as they acted like they would. So now I\u2019m stuck on an island with no stores because the First Relocater hasn\u2019t supplied building materials. I\u2019m about to lose my MIND. For the love of GOD at least change it so if I throw money at Nintendo and buy another copy of the game I can have a new island!!!!","Back in my day you got one town and you liked it! Learn to share with the people you live with.","Like all the other reviews say garbage move to lock a game to a console! Greedy mofos","There are some basic things that should be in the game that aren\u2019t and make things extremely frustrating while playing and customizing your island.\r When placing buildings you can \u201cpreview\u201d where the building is going but only in your limited field of view. No overhead map to line object up to get an overall perspective. Even though you get this high point of view when a visitor flies to your island. Hell even grids to line things up would be helpful, since they show grids for the plot on the building being placed but nothing around it.\r When paying to move a building. If you\u2019re only trying to move a building several spaces to line buildings up, you can\u2019t! Forces you to move it once out of the way and then back again.\r With the amount of switch shortages across the world and limiting one island per switch makes no sense. Complete greed and not consumer friendly. Even to limit you being able to move your island transfer to another switch is complete opposite of consumer friendly. I have an OG switch and want to upgrade to a new V2 switch and there has not been a good resolution without jumping through hoops and praying I that I will be able to do so.\r Not even 2 weeks into the game release and the update has replaced half your resources you normally farm with \u201cspecial bunny day eggs\u201d along with an ungodly amount of recipes for the event. It appears several updates to try and help the situation have been released, but still problem-some. This is a prime example of \u201calways-connected\u201d games gone wrong.\r Let\u2019s talk about item storage. Why is there not a chest to craft to place outside your home to hold normal items like wood and minerals for crafting? No, I have to go inside my house, wait for a load screen, pick items from storage, craft with an inside crafting table, put things away and then back outside to wait on another load screen. So if an item broke and you didn\u2019t have the resource on you to craft, whatever you were hoping to get will despawn while forced to go in to get items to craft. This is especially painful early on in the game with limited on character storage space.\r Now onto the crafting mechanic. If I\u2019m trying to craft multiples of the same item and have the resources to do so, why do I have to go through multiple screens and animations to craft the same item over and over? Talk about time waster.\r One last complaint. I had a visitor come to my a campsite. Not a visitor I wanted, but chatted with them to see what they had to say. My only 2 responses were to offer them a house only island. Could not refuse them coming. Only good news is by a quick search result that I can kick them off later after move in and several days.\r Don\u2019t get me wrong, the game is fun and offers a lot, but can still be drastically improved on function. Expect a lot of clunky and repetitive animations and not any type fluid gameplay. The game is good by offering things to come back daily and check on resources. But, a lot of free to play games do the same with the same clunky gameplay mechanics. Publisher stepped up the graphics moving from 3DS to switch, but fluid gameplay is lacking for basic mechanics and to keep the game moving forward. The idea of less loading screens to keep the player immersed is something other companies are doing well. This game is lacking that in some key areas as described.","A brand-new Animal Crossing experience! And a fresh one. The in-game content seems endless, while the typical atmosphere of the franchise is fully present.\rNothing to say.

I've only put around 5 hours on this so far, but I'm already in love!\r After spending 5-10 more hours on it today, I can say this is easily the best animal crossing to exist!

This game is HD and a great step up. I've enjoyed every aspect of the game. This game is the best animal crossing game to date. People who are review bombing because they can't have seperate islands per switch are just being childish. The game wants to create that social experience and that decision is a creative one.

New mechanics have seemingly been added at the expense of older great mechanics. I'm around 20 hours into the game and have my town setup along with several house expansions. The worst thing about this game is the complete and total lack of Gyroids. Why would Nintendo remove a major staple of the AC universe. I am seriously considering returning this game at this point because I could honestly go back and play any other AC game and have more fun than I have with new horizons.","This is Animal Crossing! People that are complaining, just bought this game because everyone else was buying it and didn't do any research about the style of game. It was advertised it was 1 island per switch. Yes you have to wait real world days for stuff to progress because it's animal crossing. It's like you bought Doom Eternal expecting there to be a deep woven narrative with heavy dialogue and character building. Actual game score 8/10.","Great game, so relaxing in these times. Everyone seems to be complaining about only one island per switch but I sort of like this idea. I am player two and there have only been a few things that I haven't been able to do but in the grand scheme of the game and the fact that you can explore so much.","bad bad decision by Nintendo with the local multiplayer. wtf were they thinking?","Amazing game. All the people review bombing are just entitled children don't let there review sway your decision to buy this awesome game.","Good stuff, no idea why it's currently at a 6.5 y'all stay mad. Anyways chillie","To say that  co-op is terrible, or that the game isn't fair, simply means that you're not putting in the effort to enjoy the game. Player 2, if you are coming into the game expecting that you'll be able to do so so much, you wont. Just like player 1, they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you're complaining about.\r I understand the one island per switch, but there's two reasons for this.\rFirst, an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch. With the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory, and your museum and encyclopedia, that all adds up. Then imagine every user on a switch, 8 users with their own individual islands, on top of that per user, 7 additional houses per shared island. That's a grand total of 8 unique islands, and 64 unique players. That amount of data adds up, quickly.\r Secondly, adding onto the data situation. The game allows 8 users total on an island. If you're playing online, the max is 8 on your island total. Given the switch has a total of 8 users, its the best choice to make. One island per switch, one player per user.\r To review bomb a game means you aren't taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this.\r Overall, in my opinion, the game is a 10. With future DLC, it'll bump it to an 11.","Brilliant game, true to the Animal Crossing series while trying out some fresh and effective mechanics such as crafting and terraforming. Don\u2019t listen to people who are giving this game 0 stars\u2014 they\u2019re just salty that you can only have one island per Switch?","This is essentially a remake of the original animal crossing and it\u2019s beyond amazing. I know a lot of people are mad because they have to share their island with the people that they actually physically live with in the real world but that\u2019s how animal crossing games have always been. Back in the day you could add people you lived with to your town but you could only play one at a time, now you can actually have two people play at the same time which is, like I said before... amazing!! If you don\u2019t wish to exist on the same island as the people you live with I wouldn\u2019t blame the game for that, seems like that is something that is a much deeper more personal issue","Can\u2019t even play the game. This is overrated unplayable trash. Do not buy. Play stardew valley instead. Much better in everyway. There\u2019s no real character creation, story is super boring, limited gameplay styles and dated graphics make Animal Crossing: New Horizons one of the most overrated games of all time. So many regrets playing, not to mention coop and multiplayer is a lie.","Hi,The game itself is ok. However limiting to one island per console is crazy! My partner played before me now I basically can't do anything she has to do everything. To get DIY recipes the second player had to buy them but only after the first player has got them during game play.Essentially Nintendo expect you to have a second switch for all users to fully enjoy this game which is nuts. You pay alot of money for these games you at least expect everyone to be able to use them properly on one console!I really hope Nintendo address this in an update!","Y'all are being ridiculous. This game is phenomenal and it doesn't deserve to be review bombed because you can only have one island per system. I get it, kids won't enjoy the feature, but review bombing ignores how otherwise extraordinary this game is.","The review bombing is dumb, this is a super polished and incredibly fun game that deserves all the praise and popularity its getting","Don't listen to anyone about the 1 island thing, this is probably one of the best games in the series. Sure you start off with one island, but you gain terraforming to grow them, and you can use another in-game currency, Nooks Miles, to buy a ticket to an uninhabited island, sometimes even friends will be there from past games to invite back. There is no frame drops and a lot more improvement when it comes to graphics, you can change the music on the island and place where you'd like most buildings and structures to go for your society. It's the same animal crossing with improvements. There is plenty more to decorate your house with, multiple rooms along with the expansion of your house, and Isabelle.... just Isabelle. Upgrades for inventory, tools, overall improvements to the hud, I could go on forever, a lot of these people are mad about a single island, but it's the size of a single town in Animal Crossing, so a lot of people are crybabies, because not only can you visit other islands in multiplayer, but if you don't have friends visiting villagers in game invite you to theirs and you can go to uninhabited ones. Some crybabies need to grow up.","We bought this to play as a family and wanted especially to encourage our 6 year old daughter to get involved. We made her the main resident, and carried on from there. What we didn\u2019t know is that the remaining three of us are basically just passengers in her game. She hasn\u2019t taken to it like we hoped and now the rest of us can\u2019t do anything because the island won\u2019t progress. We wanted to all be on the same island so this would help us anyway, but you can\u2019t even decide to have an island each. You\u2019re just stuck. I\u2019m sure the single player game is fine, but don\u2019t bother with it if you\u2019re looking for the couch multiplayer.","The other user reviews are correct; the insane design decision of having one island per switch has effectively killed multiplayer for this game. You simply feel like a guest on someone else's island, and if the player who registered the island stops playing all gameplay progression comes grinding to a halt, potentially causing you to lose many hours of work. In addition to that I found single player rather pointless and cumbersome. Selecting tools, crafting, managing your inventory are all much more of a chore than they should be. The NPC's are all very boring, just wandering around all day and coming out with the same stock answers. Crafting your own furniture and items is pointless if you can't actually interact with them. What's the point of crafting a musical instrument if you can't use it? Why bother with a mirror if you can't see your reflection? Instead you just spend your time gathering resources. It's not that I dislike games of this genre, per se, but with Animal crossing you start off on such a tiny island with so little to do that's interesting I am really struggling to see why there are so many glowing reviews. Stardew Valley is a hundred times better than this meagre offering and that's an indie game developed by one person.","Nice phone app for a not to smart 12 year old girl.\r Not recommended for adults.","ANIMAL CROSSING: NEW HORIZONS is a new school tamagotchi. Pure gameplay, like sims and etc. Can't recommend to everyone.","Bastante malo comparado con otros animal crossing, se hace aburrido y es repetitivo","ok people, i see many reviewers gave this masterpiece 0/10 or something like that and that alone makes me super upset. This game is amazing, very fun to play, very friendly, gives you freedom to do whatever the hell you want with your island and because \"I cAn'T pLAy WiTh mY kId i GivE tHis GaMe 0/10\" reviews many people might actually not buy it and miss such an amazing experience. This game is awesome. and you can play with you kids, god damn it. You just have to live on the same island and share things, which is still so much fun, as you can all donate different thing things to the museum and all of that, which is super awesome. JUST GO AND PLAY THIS GAME IT IS AMAZING YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!","Amazing game. So much fun stuff to do. Very well made, both for tv and handheld use. Easily worth the money. Considering how much fun is to be had, it makes sense they put in some restrictions. Not worth complaining about, you\u2019ll still get hundreds of hours out of it, each!","To quote my girlfriend: \"That's the best game I've ever played!\".\rAnd she is player number 2.\rGood job. And shame on 0 bombers. The concept of the game is pretty clear, has always been. Having restriction makes me speak with my girlfriend about the island, how to make it better, together.","I\u2019ve spent 200 hours on this game and it is so much fun. I do not understand why people would give it a zero solely because it has no second island option. Sure it\u2019s kind of annoying to share with my sister but this game is really well done and fun to play. You can tell the developers put in a lot of time and effort and they still come out with major free updates. I think a lot of developers could learn from this like game freak by allowing free updates that improve the game over time instead of dlc that costs 30 dollars for assets that should have been in the base game. Kinda going off on Pok\u00e9mon so I\u2019ll get back to animal crossing. I love all of the new characters and improved quality of life additions. One complaint is the tool durability but it\u2019s only a minor pain once you upgrade your shop. I\u2019d give it a 9.5 out of ten but I want to give a ten to combat all of the zeros given to this game.","This is by far the best Animal Crossing title in the franchise! The world looks great, the villagers are bright and cheerful, and terraforming is very addicting. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a relaxing life-sim.","The new version is so good it has to be the first time in the world and I have a lot of fun with the game and the game is so much better than the other app I have been to the store and I don\u2019t know what to do with the new one and the other two of them are the same as the same thing as the other side of the table in a row and a small one on a plate and the first one was a little too easy but I would love it ","It's a great game but it sucks to be player 2. I bought the game and my girlfriend created her character first, so no I can't build a museum, can't build a store and so on. Also, if she had already collected most of the resources and watered all flowers, all I can do is go fishing, catching bugs or travel on another island. Everything is very cute on the island, but it leaves no content for me.","Point and laugh at the children in the User Reviews giving this game a bad score just because of how salty they are.","The fact you can only have 1 island per console sucks. My husband i purchased, and we are first time players of Animal Crossing. Had we known we couldn't each have our island, accomplish our own objectives, name them, and all etc. We would have never purchased.","Only 1 players can play the game. others can just follow. so if more people play the game you need more nintendos... 55 euro for a gamne only 1 player can play is a ripoff.","Definitely the best iteration so far! I've only played for a few days but there is SO much to do and it really gives you all creative liberties as advertised. I haven't even made it to future portions of the game, but I'm so excited to see what this game has in store for me!There is no strong narrative, but that's standard for AC games. Graphics are amazing, and the island feels much more alive compared to previous games.I know there's been a lot of criticism of only one island per console, but I honestly LOVE the concept of sharing an island on the console. It makes the island feel more alive and is true to real life, that you're not the only one in the world.","I was waiting for this game about a month. This is my first game in series. Was very excited about living on the island with my wife. The game is awesome. Graphics, activity, visiting other players islands, postcards, mails, etc.\r But my personal score is 5/10.\r Why? Well because my wife landed on the island first. And now im living on my wifes island. Thats right. This is NOT our island. Second player have NO rights. He can just run around, gather stuff, catch fishes, sometimes help the first player collecting resources for new buildings. Is it interesting for the second player? I dont think so. The progress of the second player fully depends from the first player. This is a HUGE disapointment.\r I hope Nintendo will give us the oportunity to delegate authority of the Speaker (russian version of the game) to second player.","The game content is great and and looks gorgeous. While the game mechanics is almost perfect - for the primary player at least. The game should provide equal experience across Switch users/profiles, be it the one who played the game first or the secondary players. If Nintendo fix this issue, I would give this game a perfect score in an instant.","Fun game. Highly polished single-player experience. However, the multiplayer/single island per console has soured my feelings about the game.\r The game experience for the second resident (P2) is considerably different and IMO lesser than that of the \"island representative\" (P1). As P2 I have very little control or influence over what is built in the town and where. I cannot contribute directly to town projects with my resources. I am prevented from unlocking certain recipes. I am prevented from using certain tools until P1 unlocks them as part of the story.\r The only way for multiple players to get the full experience of building and refining their own island is to buy multiple consoles. I don't interpret this as malice/greed so much as an oversight. What works for a handheld does not necessarily work for a home console like the switch.\r As it stands I recommend the game for single players, but I cannot fully recommend the game to anyone sharing a console.","I started playing BEFORE my boyfriend. And in the end, after he went into the game, he just had NOTHING left to do there, because  I had already collected all the loot and everything that was on the island. The limitation of one island per Switch is so annoying, why we need co-op mode at all, when only one player gets everything? Sad that Nintendo don't care about fans, only about selling overpriced games with low fps. Jeezuz, Nintendo really has became worse than EA.","Pretty unbelievable how the multiplayer turned out to be. The game itself is pretty enjoyable, but for a family trying to share the game... I just don't see how not allowing each player to enjoy the same features is justifiable. Hopefully they make some kind of patch to address this, but I doubt it. If you play solo, go for it.","Das Spiel ist sehr gut. F\u00fcr mich und meine Schwestern ist es ein riesen Spa\u00df und jeden Tag gibt es was neues zu machen. Auch dass System mit dem das man nicht   alles sofort bekommt ist sehr gut gelungen. DA man sich jetzt mehr Zeit f\u00fcrs spielen nehmen muss um voran zu kommen. Ein sehr  guter Nachfolger","Je suis scandalis\u00e9 par le fait que mes enfants ne puissent pas avoir chacun leur propre \u00eele. Encore un service minimum pour Big N qui nous force la main pour acheter encore et encore. Je met 2 car je me sent trahi par la publicit\u00e9 mensong\u00e8re.","good game really enjoying it. really wish they made better design decisions such as making online behind a paywall and you only being able to have 1 ISLAND PER CONSOLE. whatever dude just annoying","This game is awful, boring, and dull. You can only have one island per console. I want my money back.","I made a metacritic account specifically for this review. This is not a review-bomb, this score actively reflects the amount of joyment I got out of this game keeping in mind the following things:\r 1: The 60 dollar price tag\r2: The Islands limitations\r3: The gameplay itself\r The game itself looks beautiful, and the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun. This gameplay loop is relatively unaltered for a second player who has to reside on the same island as the first. However, any meaningful progress, and thus reasons to boot up the game at all, has been stripped away for a second (or more) player.\rBeing player 2(+) means you can not make progress towards the museum (and thus catching different bugs and fish is moot), it means you can not interact with villagers in the same way (and thus always have to resort to buying every item from the store, instead of being able to find the recipes through the story), and generally means you are living the life of an NPC on player 1s island.\r Being player 1, on the other hand, provides a well-polished and extremely rich game, fully worthy of a score around 9/10. It's a unique life simulator, where everything you accomplishes gives you no small amount of joy.\r In other words, this game is a gem, where one meaningful design flaw ruins the experience for hundreds of thousands of players (which I doubt is an exaggeration).\r I am contributing my own review in the hopes of any sort of change coming to this current setup.\r I am fully aware that having multiple islands per Switch is unrealistic, and would also detract from the premise of the game, but I do feel it should be possible for active players to have the same sense of wonder and explorations. Make npc's give player 2(+) the same items, allow player 2(+) to submit their captures to the museum, and allow them to contribute to the building of other items. I understand that the general lay-out of a town can be determined by one person, but that doesn't mean every fun element of the game has to be stripped away.\r Thank you for coming to my Ted-Talk.","So, I'm not going to review bomb the game like everyone else is. I actually do like this game and see it as a pretty okay game, not the best, not the worst. It's got wonderful fun and interesting villagers, and the game's great for when you just want to sit back and relax while the whole world burns from all the crazy **** going on but... here are my main issues with the game:\r -Island limitation, being restricted to one island per console is kind of a dick move in my opinion especially when I cannot do anything other than upgrade my house because I let my boyfriend make his character/island first. the Nintendo Switch is expensive as all hell, no one's going to buy a second Switch just because of that unless they're rich.\r -Controls. The controls are just.. awful, and apparently it's always been like this according to my boyfriend. I feel like with this being a new game, you guys could have fixed the controls so it's not a pain in the ass to whack a rock with a shovel, dig things up, capture bugs or chop down trees. You have no excuse to keep the controls the same as previous titles.\r -Story progression limitation, as mentioned with Island limitation, you, as the secondary player, cannot do **** meaning only the first character can do the story while you just sit there doing nothing other than upgrading your own house...so you end up having to wait until the the first player does things to do stuff. It really ruins the experience for everyone involved.","Having one island is bad but the game is good. But I hope they update the game to have multiple islands.","The game had such hype behind it only to be quite possibly the most disappointing  of the franchise it feels so unfinished its unreal Only 2 shopsNo island to meet new people and friends Tools break what is extremely  irritating Slowest paced game we have ever had House prices are absolute insanity the last room costing 2.5 million!Also cant expand rooms for literally no reasonAmiibo are way to much of a grind taking 5 days each total to have them move in and walk around and even then the spot can get taken meaning you could be putting in the work for nothingDiving is completely missing on the animal crossing game based on a island Furniture  has been completely cut what shouldn't really be a thing keeping in mind how delayed this game was from new leaf and even had its date pushed back","The game is mostly fun, although it runs into the standard animal crossing hurdle of having to wait days for everything. This would all be forgivable and even acceptable if you were able to have more than one island per game. With more than one active user the game grinds to an annoying halt. With the constant need to switch between accounts to share quest details. Yes, for some reason a second user has no ability to see details of the latest mission set by Tom Nook. More than that, some quests follow an all or nothing approach. So if you collect 15 iron and your wife, sibling or roommate has 15, you can't share in the glory. One of you has to drop them to the other to proceed. It's a silly limiting system and unexpected from a game that has allowed for multiple towns in the past.","This is the dumbest game ive ever played. I played the game in an endless grind for 5 hours straight only to get nowhere on my island and not move the island forward. Mr. Nook, not only never told me what I should do when asked, no one else on the island helped either. **** real. **** this game","Only one island per switch? are you serious?, that means only one player can evolve the island and play all the missions...\r UPDATE NEEDED!","Seems like a great game.  Unfortunately...  I have bought two copies and cannot progress due to horrible game design.  How could they put out something to the public with such a huge flaw??",".... You already know why. One player per console isn't quite right for such a fun game. It's no fun for siblings to fight over being the founder. Hopefully this might get patched.","While there are many good points with the game. I do enjoy playing, but the underlying issues of the lack of multiple islands, and the fact tools break are annoying and un-enjoyable. The idea that your tools break so often should mean the furniture you make as well should break just as often as tools. It just takes everything out of the groove and just infuriating when your tools just break over and OVER again.","I just want to preface this with, I am fine with the one island per console restrictions! I think it's a bit of an ea move but I truly am okay with it and I'm well aware it was properly disclosed to potential buyers early in development. What seems absolutely ridiculous is that really only one player is truly playing the game they payed for, while everyone else is stuck being a glorified villager who can upgrade their house. There aren't even ways to get recipes for certain furniture because there is no access to the story or even simple town upgrades like bridges and inclines if you aren't player one! This is ridiculous and Nintendo knows it, especially because these restrictions are not something Nintendo was upfront about because they knew it would hurt game sales. The absolute lack of care for it's customers in this regard is just not something I had come to expect from Nintendo and I am shocked and appaled. I payed for the game too and every player on the system should be able to play regardless of whether everyone is on the same island or not. Either make all players equal or give everyone their own island... because what we have at current is a game thats only fit to be played by player one. While I do understand that Nintendo is attempting to sell more consoles (though that's not even possible at this time due to them being sold out nearly everywhere) they are also selling a product, Animal Crossing is a product that people payed $60 and it CAN be held to the standard that every player in the game can actually... you know... play. Nintendo not being upfront about the fact that it is essentially a game only able to be played by one person oer console turns animal crossing into a **** product for everyone who shares a switch, which might I add with it's multiple accounts per console, was marketed as a sharable family console when it first came out, not something like a ds that everyone was meamt to have their own... I'm just going to be honest, if you share a switch don't get the game, not until something changes. Either you'll be the resident representative and you're family or partner will be stuck being upset amd probably a bit resentful (Ive been in and heard of plenty of fights breaking out over this game in families) or you'll be the second player and will find your gameplay  so limited you'd be just as well off playing the free mobile game pocket camp. If you have your own switch, great, good for you, get the game I'm sure its a blast, if not, maybe get an older edition of the game or wait until its possible to buy another console, or play a game like stardew with a similar vibe to animal crossing. Just do anything but buy this game because you will be disappointed.","I have one Nindendo Switch console for two children, I also sometimes play. My children and I play all nintendo games from our own accounts and only in that game we can not play this way. Greedy Nintendo entire an artificial restriction - 1 console with a game only for 1 account / person. I will not buy this game (so I would buy it). I hope that Nindendo will lift this restriction.","1 egg, 2 eggs, 3 eggs, 4 eggs, 5 eggs, 6 eggs, 7 eggs, 8 eggs, 9 eggs...\r egg","2 players can't be at the same console. Fix that Nintendo, and I give you 10 \u2b50","I love backwards games design. Like not being able to have my own separate island or playing coop and being a glorified spectator.","I bought the switch when it came out and haven\u2019t had a worse experience with it. Zelda was amazing, Smash was awesome, but Animal Crossing has been completely ruined. My wife used to love the original for game cube so I bought it, she made her own account on the switch and started playing. I decided to give it a try and only after playing for a few hours each did we realize that you don\u2019t each get your own separate save file. It completely ruins the game because we can\u2019t both play and do what we want.","Where do I begin, no this isn't your regular blind rant of someone complaining about, one switch one island. I'm here to educate you why I chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call New horizons this score. Allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game. To call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside you telling you that it is. After many iteration this latest installment offers NOTHING and I mean ZERO new concepts, ideas or features involving multiplayer game play. That is what makes this such a lackluster game. I mean you go to a town and then what? Nothing absolutely nothing especially those posh elites thinking that you must do nothing to change a town or even run because it wears out the grass. Why have them over then? To show off your island that was obtained obviously by means of time travel and you have the audacity to set rules on your throne of lies? Seriously if you time travel you are only cheating yourself of the true experience of the game which is to grind and work hard for your accomplishments and should think twice about posting your \"perfect\" town for fake internet points. With nothing to penalize time traveler they just ruin the point of the game and finish it within a week. This game offers nothing new compared to the older games in fact the museum received an overhaul on its interior yet there is less to fill it with. Yes that's right because there are no paintings and no deep sea creatures to turn in.Another thing about that. There is still no new additions to the bug, fish and fossils list and that's shameful just going to find the same ones over again with nothing new to find.The crafting system was the most exciting thing I wanted. Until the gimic ran out faster than starting tools could last. Seriously it became more of a chore than a fun feature. There's no insensitive to get better gear if the cheapest one does the same job as a golden version of the tool. And on that note how about you explain why golden tools break? They are not supposed to break they are a symbol of one's accomplishments to obtain them and should not be reduced to the games gimic.Don't get me started with the island tour nonsense. And I paraphrase \"each island you go to will never be the same as the last so make sure you do everything you can before you leave because we won't be coming back ever\" yet, there are countless times I've visited the island with the same layout and same island shape and nothing in them. Way to bait and switch the experience of visiting 5 islands on end with slight differences.I'm glad that the events are stowed away so people can't just time travel to get everything off season that's right I'm talking to you time travelers, you're no better than businesses selling their Christmas stuff in August. Boy how hypothetical you all must be.Worst part is that they made a conscious decision to push the game release date further down the to ensure quality yet there is so many bugs in the game especially game breaking. You can lose your save file for popping a balloon in the sky. Yup every time you do that you risk data loss. Tell me again why was the game pushed back? If that was the  choice why wasn't time spent to better multiplayer features. To summarize the game is great single player, terrible multiplayer and so much content is missing the game is bare bones and I'm not talking about holiday things I'm talking about what to do in game. There's nothing to do after an hour of play because the daily \"chores\" are completed that fast.","I love this game and almost everything it has to offer. The only BIG issue is that I am the second player because my I let my girlfriend play first. Little did I know that it means that I am completely dependent of her actions to progress in the game. After achieving the 3 star rating that were needed to convince kk slider to come to the island, I could not do anything until my girlfriend would play again. It is very annoying to feel like a second rate villager compared to my girlfriend. If this wasn't a issue, I would gladly give this game a 10+.","This is a fun and relaxing game to play. There are a ton of things to do and many shenanigans possible. Definitely buy this game - ONLY if you live alone or are fortunate to have multiple switches ($260 to $360) per person that wishes to play this game. This was ok when the games used to cost $30, but not in 2020, not for $60. This was ok for the DS when the cartridge couldn't handle the storage for multiple saves, but not for a 6+ GB game. I have refunded my game until Nintendo addresses this issue. Nintendo needs to stop milking money from us for nostalgia. I expect better from Nintendo.","My partner and I purchased this not inexpensive game and are saddened to see that only 1 of us can have an island (1 island per switch). The other can have their own character and live there too, but the experience is not comparable. I was really looking forward to playing this game but I am unable to do so properly. I don't even bother playing as the secondary character as the experience is so lacking, and seeing what my partner is achieving just adds emphasises this.So  my rating is 0 as Nintendo have basically said that unless I'm willing (or more importantly, able) to purchase a second Switch, I cannot play. I am not willing or able to and I imagine this is the same for most Switch owners.","One island per console.  If there was the ability to have more than one island per console I would say this game is a 9 or a 10, but this forced island sharing is the one of the most obvious examples of corporate greed I've ever seen.","I had never played Animal Crossing before, I bought the game yesterday and was really excited to play. My boyfriend was the one to play first, and when it was my turn that's when I found out you can only have one island per console. Even worse, the secondary player can't even access all of the features in the game which makes the gameplay dependent on the primary player to progress. I think this is absolute **** and a very greedy move by Nintendo. I want to enjoy this game, but this makes it literally impossible. Hope you'll change this ASAP, or I'll seriously reconsider supporting your now greedy company in the future.","My wife and I purchased this game. I started an island, next thing I knew my wife started an island. Low and behold she joined my island. Stupid design. I have played about 2 hours while my wife has played about 20 hours and can\u2019t progress without me going on and unlocking stuff because we share an island. Equivalent of a $10 game. Not worth $60. Not worth buying for multiplayer. Not worth a good review because the design of the game is so poorly done!","ok, it's fine having just an island and sharing with my sister, it's not so cool being forced to share all the resources, but it's totally awful that the player 2 can't do anything to the island. unable to build bridges, new homes and also roads. that completely ruined the experience, my sister doesn't want to play anymore and maybe me neither","come on, really? multiple switches required? what a cash grab. Hopefully this **** will catch up with Nintendo sooner or later.","Dear Nintendo ( and anyone who reads this),\rIve been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life. I had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and I loved them.\rOne of my most loved games was animal crossing. I played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day. Of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out and played it.\rSadly new horizons is why i actually write to you guys for the first time.\rThe game looks good and the crafting is fun but the game feels empty, unfinished and lacking. It feels like the bare bone basics of any animal crossing before it and thats it. The multiplayer is seriously lacking and that is for an console that has heavily been marketed as something to play together just unacceptable. Local multiplayer is pretty much just running behind someone and waiting for them to do something . The most i can do with the ones quarantined with me is collecting wood while one hits the trees and the other one picks it up and the worst thing is it doesn\u2019t even go to that persons inventory but to that dumb chest. It doesn\u2019t feel like you did or archived anything as the second player. You cant progress and since the game is so empty and the only thing to do is progress means the game is pretty much worthless if you are the second player.\r The online multiplayer is better but still boring after a few times there isn\u2019t much to do with the person so it\u2019s mostly just repeating everything you have done that morning on your island on another. I cant imagine why you would go back a step from new leaf there you knew already that there needed to be more for multiplayer and tried to add something.\r But the worst for me is that as far as i can see ive already ,,finished,, the game. My main motivations to play regularly in previous games were to build out my house completely, to build out the stores and get all the stores and then at last to make my town look pretty. Those where the long time goals, the big goals that stood over the smaller ones.\r Ive already almost completely build out my house because there is nothing else to do in this game than grind for money.\rIn comparison it took me years to get to this stage in previous installments because there was so much more to do.\rAs far as i can see ive already hit the top on the nook shop. There doesn\u2019t seem to be another upgrade as far as the Internet can tell me.\rAnd the only thing thats left is making my town pretty and im already almost perfectly happy with everything on that front.\r When i started this game it felt abit boring at first because there wasn\u2019t much to do right at the beginning it was slow. Something that already put off one of my friends that bought the game.  Then after it picked up a bit i was so glad because i thought this was going to become great. But now after such short time i already have done what i can do and the daily chores have become kinda meaningless.\r Even if in updates you guys add stuff that had already been in previous  games what motivation do i have to not play around with it for alittle bit and then put it down again? My town is already build all around the limited buildings that are in the game now. Getting rid of everything and terraforming it again will be a chore and will probably make any much needed content thats added less enjoyable.\rAnd when you guys now slowly add the stuff that should have been in it from the beginning will you even bother to put in something new?\r It makes me so sad and angry to leave such a bad review on the game. Because i love the game, i love the characters and im sure the people who worked on it put their heart into it. The items look gorgeous the characters and environments too. But the game is empty and it feels like there wasn\u2019t enough time so it got sold unfinished in the hopes that nobody would play through the first part before it could get fixed up into an actual game.\rAnd it pains me so much to say this but i dont know if its worth the money it costs.\rI wont be telling my friends to buy it. Maybe ill tell them to wait until it actually gets made into a full game. I hear all the time that it will probably get updates that will ad in more. But for me putting out a game that feels unfinished is unacceptable. Updates shouldnt be there to make it a complete game but to add extra stuff to expand the lifetime of a game.\rIm more than disappointed im heartbroken.\r I hope this gets to the ones who can actually change anything about animal crossing/ the strategy that is currently used on this game.","This is an amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","The one island per console is a really huge issue. Nintendo just wants you to buy more consoles and copies. If they added the OPTION to share an island, this could be one of the greats on the switch, but sadly greed is a thing.","Enjoy Earth Day review Nintendo!Thanks to be always the same mediocre industry when it comes to patches!I payed to be punished","Only one island per console. Nintendo needs to rethink this strategy, I for one will double think when buying Nintendo games in the future, that includes consoles.","Very disappointed in the local multiplayer and one island per switch. Nintendo is horrible for doing this to families.","The fact that it's getting review bombed speaks upon how absolutely amazing this game is. Y'all truly hate to see it winning.","I'm really dissapointed with this game :( In my house im with my little cousin and my sister, and One island per console?! The only way to get another is to buy another console I don\u2019t mind buying another copy of the game but another console is too much. I\u2019m leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart. :(","I don\u2019t really like the changes they made in the update. Such a slow game to play. If I wanted to work this hard making fake money I would at least want the game to be more interesting. It sucks you can\u2019t return a game once you buy it. I feel bad for all the people who are now stuck with this 80$ game","This is the most relaxing game on Switch, the single-player content is awesome. This is the place to meet new friends.\r But why are people review-bombing this game? i know that \"the one island per console\" is bad, but its not a reason to give this 0/10. They did it on purpose.\rShame on you people.","As a single-player experience, this game is phenomenal. I have seen this series progress since the first North American release on the Gamecube and to me, it seems like it just gets better and better. In previous games, it would feel like you are the only character who really matters. Animals would hardly interact with each other or their environments and New Horizons is a breath of fresh air in that department. It is hard to find a time when the animals won't be doing something, whether it's talking to each other, going fishing, or even reading a book. To me, this adds a much better feeling of connectedness between everything on the island. Multiplayer lends itself to getting stale pretty quickly right now, but I don't see that as a criticism that detracts significantly from the overall experience of the game. What you get from this game is a relaxing experience that stands on its own as one of the best in the series.","A good way to relax despite what's going on in the world at the moment.","Really good game, some people can think its a boring game  but.... Well the point its to play a calm and peaceful game.","The best animal crossing so far. I play it everyday without fail. I love how they keep updating it.","This game is incredibly well designed. The game play is fun and lighthearted. I and my family all have copies of the game (5 in total) and we all have our own island. This requires everyone to have their own switch or switch lite, but it has really helped us to stay connected especially during this Corona virus period of time in our lives. The game itself is rather simple and straight forward, every day you login, cut trees, fish, find fruit, craft recipes and pay off (albeit slowly) your debt to Tom Nook.","It's a fun game mostly all I would expect from animal crossing the DIY is a great feature. It's a little crummy you can only build one island per console but with how they have it set up to visit other islands totally understandable. All around I think it is a great game and a big step up from the previous versionss.","After almost two months of playing this, I can confidently say that this is an excellent game, and with the amazing sales, and the constant support for this title, that it will be one of the biggest titles in the Switches lifetime.\r Pros:\rThe amount of detail put into it. For example, the museum, with its hundreds of fossils, fish and bugs.\rThere is so much to do, you\u2019ll almost never get bored. There are tons of daily activities you do, and the game constantly encourages you to get that 5 star island rating.The seasonal events are mostly very fun(except for bunny day).There were only one or two moments around the end of the 130 hours I\u2019ve played that I had nothing to do, but the next day when all resources re-spawn, you can do your daily chores, meet special characters, and do much more to try and improve your island. The sense of progression, and the feeling that everything on your island was made by you, feels great and rewarding. The online is pretty decent, and I like that you have a best friends list so that your best friends can help you and interact with your island more than strangers.\r Cons:\r The one island per console limitation is frustrating, since I tried playing with my friends locally, and it was very chaotic and confusing. If you\u2019re buying this to play as a family, I would still recommend it, but only if everyone gets along well, and likes to work together. Some tasks in the game are a bit annoying to do, and the game starts off very slowly since to actually start the actual game and finish the prologue(which is everything before you get the upgraded resident services building),  takes  5-6 days.\r Overall this is a great game that lived up to its hype, but for families who want to play together, the one island per console limitation is a huge turnoff. 9/10","Do people think Nintendo reads Metacritic reviews? Anyway, this this game is fun and relaxing, and has decent graphics and great music, as per usual with Animal Crossing. It also brings lots of new features to the table, along with some annoyances, which hopefully get patched out. My actual score would probably a 7.5 or 8, but, well, you know. Seriously guys, stop being children. There are numbers between 1 and 10.","This is a game you have to play! Ignore all of the other reviews! It is one of the best games I've ever played! While the one island per Switch thing isn't the best thing, all you have to do is buy a Switch Lite and the game! Just get a pre-owned Switch Lite for heaven's sake! People are really overexaggerating their reviews. Again, don't listen to any of them! This game is adorable and addicting, and will always have you wanting to come back each and every day! Building up your deserted island is so much fun, and even when you beat the game's \"story,\" there are endless possibilities with your island! This is an absolute must-play! Again, ignore all of the negative reviews! Those people are over-reacting and over exaggerating. If you want to play the game that bad just buy a pre-owned Switch Lite. Not that hard. Definitely an 1,000,000/10 game! Thank you, Nintendo for making this amazing and wonderful game!","I have never played this game, i will never play this game, i don't own a switch, i will never own a switch but i give it a 0/10 review because everyone is talking about it on twitch and i don't like it. Also, you guys have some issue with island stuff so im gonna pretend it bothers me too. Why only one island per console?!?!!?!?1? WTF NINTENDO","Repetitivo, Nintendo \u00faltimamente hace juegos muy b\u00e1sicos para Nintendo switch. Lamentable","Juego repetitivo sin gracia nada realista y muy malo gr\u00e1ficamente. No se lo recomiendo a nadie.","I'm surprised how low people rate this game.  I've put in more than 200 hours and had a great time playing.  This has been the perfect game for the lockdown in 2020.  Also playing with another person on the same console same island makes it even more fun.  If you put in 100+ hours in a game and had fun, that's at least a 9 out of 10 in my book.  The value is incredible.","This game could really benefit from respecting the players time a little more.  It's a decent enough time to gather resources and craft things.  But the worse offender is no way to retrieve your save file to a different Switch?  I mean what do I have to do if I buy a new switch and have to sell the one I have now? No one at Nintendo knowss how to respect people's time?","Amazing game. Animal crossing has always been about multiple people all working together to make your town better. People complaining about only getting one island are missing what animal crossing is about.","Really great game as always.

Just return your game. It's really good in my opinion. I love it.","All of the negative reviews are from people that are not familiar with the animal crossing franchise. Let me preface this by saying that in animal crossing, it was always 1 town per console from GameCube to now. Also, animal crossing never gave clear objectives because it\u2019s a do what you want when you want kind of game - extremely casual. You can access your objectives through your nook phone though and they are laid out for you, and all are pretty much optional to complete. Honestly this is a game that long time fans of the series will love, as well as fans of the mobile game pocket camp. It\u2019s very open and do as you wish, which animal crossing has always kind of been like that. If you like stardew valley, you will probably like this game also.","TODOS LOS QUE LE PONEN MENOS DE 8 A ESTE JUEGO, D\u00c9JENME DECIRLES QUE SU OPINI\u00d3N VALE CALLAMPA Y QUE A NADIE LE IMPORTA XD","I love this game and its so fun and it's even better seeing it on your TV. The people who are complaining about this game only having one island for one switch. It's like that on new leaf too.  Stop your complaining and go buy another switch for all the people in your family.  I'm gonna enjoy every minute of this game as well as all the nice graphics and playing with my friends.","It's a good game dont get me wrong. However,  the inability to have separate islands per console is an outdated model. Especially when the hardware can clearly support it. Would give it  higher rating if only nintendo had its neighborhood good guy feel. But I guess they  have the mentality  of every other game dev and want us to  shell out hundreds like we are a bunch of idiots. Had respect for nintendo but know ive lost it. Crazy part is this will keep happening and I'll watch one of my favorite companies become a ubisoft or ea","Bought the game digitally because EB games was closed. Playing on my old switch instead of switch lite because it can connect to TV. But since my old switch isn't my main, it has to be connected to the internet to see if I can play my own game. So I can literally only play at home.I wanted to be on my old switch so my gf can start and account and I could help her. But she doesn't get to experience any of the game. Now she has to play on my switch, while I play on hers. Once we buy 2 more physical copies so we can  play.Never left my review for a game in my life. This is just greedy","For me, there's no problem with the unique island ...  i knowed before buying. But, all the players blocked by the first one's progression, it's just a very bad surprise after a few hours of playing for the 5 players of my family. It's the end of the game for 4 of us. For make her happy, we let my 7 years daughter playing first .... critical failure... I'm sorry, but it's my bigger disappointment for the moment.","ok, i get that people are mad about not having two people playable on the switch, but don't review bomb the game!  0/10 basically means the game is unplayable. at the least please rate this game with a mixed review. through the whole series, animal crossing has restricted you to one island per console. nintendo isnt going to listen to review bombing. anyways, this game is really good! simple 10/10","The game is so funny is a GAME. For play !. Zeros ? Pls buy and play the game first.","Best animal crossing game of all time. This is so beautiful. So comfy. Yeap GOTY.","Started the game, played for an hour or so and then came back the next day only to have to start the entire game again, I'll be trading this one in.","Best animal crossing game to dateI understand that it\u2019s only one island per console but Nintendo might change that very soon as the production team of animal crossing are very passionate towards their games","I love animal crossing and this is the best title\reverything is beautiful, everything is improved, and every animal crossing fan needs to play just say that.\rfor people who are saying that nintendo didn't warn about being an island by nintendo switch, it's a lie, everything was warned, we even had a nintendo direct of animal crossing talking about everything in the game.","The long awaited hype for the sequel to Animal Crossing New Leaf has been met!The short delay was well worth it and I'm happy Nintendo took their time!","Taking Animal Crossing to new heights. Yes, there are some limitations, like only having one island per switch. But the amazing gameplay offered here more than makes up for that. And let's be honest, this is not an evil Nintendo scheme to sell more consoles, it's a classic Nintendo limitation to make players play and have fun together. Which is actually working really well in my household.","While the game works for players on their own console, the absolutely irredeemable policies in place regarding progression, multiplayer, and access to content make the game absolutely ridiculous to deal with. For example, there is only one island allowed per switch system, which on its own isn't bad, but when you learn that the player that created the island is the \"island representative\" and this account alone dictates the progression of the game, the entire user experience is ruined. absolutely ridiculous","This game is an excellent social simulator.\r For all of you complaining about the single-console multiplayer experience, I have some rhetorical questions below.\r For the complaints about one villager making all the story driven decisions:  If you play this game as a family, does everyone in the family make all the real-life decisions or is it just the adults?  Does everyone pay for the bills, mortgage, decide where the kids go to school?  This game is a social simulator.\r For those complaining that you have to wait for the main villager to progress so you can enjoy the island as the second player:  Do you not play together?  Do you all not enjoy real life together and usually make decisions together?  if you are an adult with kids, does the adult make most of the decisions or do the kids?  This game is a social simulator.\r I understand the Nintendo Switch is very popular and there are many more new players to the Animal Crossing franchise.  These complaints are mostly from new players to the series because previous installments of Animal Crossing are similar, i.e., New Leaf.  If you played New Leaf and have complained on this site, not sure what you were thinking, and I can't help you.\r In conclusion, If you want an adventure game where you share one console but have separate experiences, I recommend The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.  Because that's what you all are complaining about, Animal crossing is not Breath of the Wild.  All together now, this is a SOCIAL SIMULATOR!","This game is amazing and i am personally sick of this review bombing nonsense it is an incredible game and very relaxing for me personally I highly recommend you go out and buy it","BEWARE OF BUYING! YoU can only have one Island, if you want to have co-op you have to share an Island together. Player one is essessily  the boss.","If 2 Players want to play the game on one console, the second player will be seriously limited in his/her experience. So basically, since my girlfriend started the save file, i wont be able to play the full game. So i now kinda gifted this unwillingly to my girlfriend. Nice for her. Sucks for me","People are giving this a zero just because they are mad that they can't have more than one island!  This game is one of the best switch games ever made.  If the people weren't so passionate about this game..they wouldn't be on here giving it a zero...but a zero is rediculous!!","Most people have already noted that Nintendo botched the initial setup for this game. You can only create one island per CONSOLE. That seems insane, but that's been known for some time.\r I still would've reviewed the game a bit better than most, but after playing through their first \"event\", it's clear Nintendo has no idea what they're doing. They launch and promote the Cherry Blossom event and talk about obtaining recipes, encouraging you to catch petals to create cool cherry blossom related items - then they make the recipes nearly IMPOSSIBLE to obtain. You could farm balloons hoping for recipes for HOURS and come away with one or two. How is this fun or interesting? What an awful, awful event.\r The cutesy graphics and adorable sound effects and music basically mask a completely broken game mechanic leading to wasted time and disappointment.","It's a glorified mobile game with the WORST \"base building\" gameplay I've ever seen. The point is you're supposed to be able to build your island how you want, yet it's ridiculously restrictive. A key feature is to alter terrain. When does that unlock? After the \"story\" is done, well after it would have been relevant to have.\r Then we get into the play, and wait aspects of the game. Most just turn the clocks on their system forward since it's all real time. All that proves is a severe lack of content.\r It's one of those things where I laugh because people are complaining about only being able to have 1 island. You can only have 1 island, because it's a mobile game. It wasn't made to be good. It was made to make money. So if you want to know who is ruining video games. It's the fans. They don't care if it's bad, they just want more. \"It's Nintendo!\" Yeah, It's Nintendo who is taking advantage of your wallet.","Fun game. One Island is ridiculous. Only 1 player gets like 95% of the game. The other 7 miss out on a lot or can't progress further. Absolute moronic. The 2 is for the fact we planned to play together on one switch. Undoable. A higher rating would've been given if I planned to stay alone.","This game is not a good and fun experience for anybody who shares their switch. The person who creates the island is the only one allowed to do anything and they're having a good time. As anybody after the island creator, you're just allowed to pay off your loans.","total waste of money. u can only get so far each day and u have to actually wait real time until morning. oh and if u time travel u earn less interest. better to not play it than to suffer by yourself","you guys know that the one island per console thing doesn't RUIN the whole game right? and that one thing doesnt make the whole game awful right?","Countering all the undeserved and blind hate / review bombing from the salty butthurt trolls. Nintendo literally stated MONTHS before release that you only get one island per switch. The game isn't perfect, bit it isn't a 0 either. It's a great game, and greatly outweighs the setbacks of only one island.\r The main people review bombing and giving this game a zero are the idiots with a goldfish attention span who speed-run / timeskip a literally casual game to try and \"beat\" it, (if you honestly thought that going in, you deserved to feel \"ripped off\" lmao), and the salty butthurt 10-IQ mouth-breathers who who bought the game without reading then wondering why there's only one switch file per system. Again, they stated COUNTLESS TIMES that this game ONLY HAS ONE SAVE FILE PER SWITCH CONSOLE. If you were stupid enough to ignore all of that and still buy the game, that's again, your fault for not having the capacity to read simple and basic disclaimers.\r Also, this game is getting updates as we speak, there's a good chance that such things will make it back in the game. ALSO X2, whine all you want, the game sold extremely well and Nintendo, nor true animal crossing fans like me who actually buy this game and enjoy playing it, are laughing at all the haters. Stay salty, this game killed it in sales, and it's going to continue to kill it as one of the best games of the year.\r Long story short, If you want to play multiple save files, or cheat your way through the game, play new leaf. Otherwise shut up, grow up, let people enjoy things, and deal with it. 10/10.","One island per console means everyone in the household should buy a Switch right now and you might as well buy more controllers just for the heck of it cause you know they gonna go bad. If you wanna play a good quality game Nintendo is the way to go, but God'dang have fun running around with your kid being able to do nothing they can - no split screen or shared content at all.","If you read any of the other mixed or negative reviews on this site, you'll see many people primarily complaining about being locked to one island per switch and having content restricted if they're not their not the first person to play.

Please get this game it's amazing.","Cash grab game from nintendo! You need to buy second switch console just for other member of family to progress game normaly.","If you've played the Animal Crossing franchise ever before, you'll know that the reviews about 1 island per console are trivial and nothing new.

I will continue to play for along time im sure  of it but my family and i agree that they didnt  need to change it this much but the game is still enjoyable.","I loved this game as I started it up. It was so beautiful and seemed to be everything I wanted in an animal crossing game...\r Then the grind started. You need iron to unlock the recipes to explore your whole island. But you can't easily get enough iron to do that unless you can reach the rocks on the inaccessible parts of the island. So you harvest what little you can each day before being forced to wait till the next day to harvest more. And all the while, your tools are breaking, which costs iron to replace, slowing your progress.\r When you finally DO unlock the ladder to explore the whole island, you're tasked with wasting much, much more of your precious resources building stupid crap for NPC neighbors.\r This game has a lot going for it. BUT so, so much of the great content is locked behind arbitrary, frustrating, grindy nonsense. When you are the only character in the game capable of any decision making, crafting, or planning of any sort, it gets tedious fast. It wouldn't be so bad if you could *purchase* some of the resources you need, but you can't. You have to build the tools to harvest them. You have to harvest them. You have to build the furniture with them. You have to choose where the furniture goes. You have to do everything yourself if you want to unlock everything the game has to offer.\r Nintendo promised us an Animal Crossing game where we *could* completely customize every square inch of the island.\r Sadly, what they delivered is an Animal Crossing game where you are *forced* to customize every square inch of the island.\r This issue combined with the irredeemably stupid choices surrounding cloud saves and multiplayer make this one of the most disappointing games I've ever paid full price for. 5/10\r 5/10","I haven\u2019t had animal crossing new horizons yet but from all the videos, gameplays, reviews and all I really love how it is. I really want to get it already haha, it\u2019s worth it.","One island, poor graphics.I think this game really deserve 0.Only way to be heard","As a second player (bought this game initially for my GF but also wanted to give it a try) I just can't enjoy the whole Animal Crossing Story &amp; Game. I feel like a visitor on an island who can only collect, sell and upgrade his own house.\r The one island per switch limitation wasn't even communicated clearly. Thanks for nothing, Nintendo!","I share a switch with my partner. Since they're the primary player, I'm stuck with effectively half a game. While I'm sure there are ways in which sharing an island would enhance the experience, the way New Horizons implements it isn't particularly fun for the secondary players.","I really like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but the local co-op is horrible and a real shame how they treat the secondary characters in the game.  Already was letdown that we cannot have our own islands, but the fact the main character gets all the island progress quests really ruins the experience for households with more than one user and one switch.","Only one save per console. This is ruining the game for us. The Switch is a family console, we share it and it\u2019s connected the the lounge TV.\r We started playing this game together after getting it for my six year old daughter. Progress is tied to her account and progress for everyone else is dependant on what she does.  Kids don't understand this mechanic and they shouldn't have to.\r So my daughter has unlocked (with some help from me) the the part where you build the bridge followed by three new houses.  There is a lot of grinding for resources and crafting required for this - but the other players can't even help out by contributing materials or even getting the recipes for the items that need to be crafted!  We're just passengers and the whole experience feels cheap and empty.\r This is totally unnecessary design - shame on you, Nintendo.","This game is phenomenal. It\u2019s amazing. The graphics are great and there\u2019s an amazing amount of detail. I love the vibe this game gives off. Now to all the people putting 1-3 because, they were the second player and there wasn\u2019t a second island for you to make, how **** stupid are you??? When has the EVER been an animal crossing game were there were multiple towns for different save files? Like seriously? Maybe you should do your research before **** about a good game that you had no idea what you were doing.","If you have a family of kids who might have some interest in playing this game and you don\u2019t have enough Switch consoles for each of them to have their own island, you may want to reconsider your purchase to avoid family feuds. Currently sharing with 4 family members (5th one pending) and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island, once you have new players move in, you have to share (Or force others to share) limited resources, creative space, argue over plots of land, villagers and landscaping decisions. You have to greatly modify your play in order to accommodate for others on your island, which may be fun in some cases (co op with your SO) but with kids/others who will ruin things or don\u2019t care about sharing.. your game experience is significantly reduced. Only the first player gets the special missions/rewards and any additional profile that moves in to the island is left in the dark as far as instructions and introductions and additional perks. For $60 you get to fight over who gets to play first in the day to get the limited resources of the island, and for the small cost of ANOTHER console, you can have a separate island for a second player! In the past you can easily have extra game cartridges/memory files for new islands but now you have to buy a whole additional console?! With 7 players in the house, we do pretty good with sharing the Switch so we know we don\u2019t need a second one, so why would you force your players to have a second console for another island? This is outrageous of the game developers, and I will not condone this behavior by big companies who already have a lot of money to begin with. I refuse to patronize Nintendo and Animal Crossing any further because of their apparent and disgusting greed.","One island per switch is a f***n stupid idea. Should have option to have each save file. Only player one can really play the game","I bought this game just to play the whole family, but this is impossible.My son created the island and now I can't do anything new, if my son doesn't play.Nintendo, this is a bad thing !!!!!","We were so excited for this game. So much so we purchased 2 switches and 2 copies of Animal Crossing. We promptly returned the unopened game and are looking to gift the opened version to a 4 year old, because that's how much it's worth. Absolutely boring game that is a waste of time and money.","This is it. I'm not buying any more nintendo products. The co-op in this game is just ridiculous. Forcing people to buy more consoles.\rThe greed is disgusting. This is so anti-consumer.\rI played until the KK slider concert, I would have enjoyed the game if it didn't have the stupid multiplayer restrictions.\rI never have to deal with this level of crap with other consoles. It sucks cause I really loved nintendo franchises. But they can't keep on doing this.","As many people have mentioned, this game might be fine for a one-person household but for any more it\u2019s awful. Second or later players can\u2019t do hardly anything and everyone is stuck on the same small island. Only the primary player gets any significant control; everyone else gets a highly inferior experience. You can have only one player per Switch, which is ridiculous. No matter how much fun this looks, it is in NO WAY a $360 game, which is what buying the Switch and game will cost you. Don\u2019t buy this game! Spend it on something else, perhaps with actual decent value.","I got this game expecting both my girlfriend and I to enjoy it. I absolutely loved the game and spent countless hours on it. My girlfriend played separately on their account. Then we got to talking about it one day and I find out that not only was I forced to move on the island already created when I started, there are GOALS and parts of the game I didn\u2019t even know existed and couldn\u2019t access because I was not the first person to happen to play the game. I spent my money to only be able to play part of a game. I don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t just be like every other game with save files and not take my freedom to play away.","Fix the one island problem! It's so frustrating that only one person can make progress in the game","My kids are devastated. They are relegated to NPCs essentially since my oldest is the \u201cfounder\u201d. One island per switch is a pure cash grab by Nintendo to sell more Switch consoles.","Spent hours trying to gather materials, miles, etc. only to find out that my wife's main account is the only one able to make progress in the game. Our little girl's account can't even make progress. We can't even get an axe. This should not be an issue for a game like this. Absolutely ridiculous. Great game if you have one switch account but terrible with other accounts.","If you are a solo player, you will likely enjoy the game. However, the decision to allow only one island per switch, along with the fact that only one player on the island has any power to progress, has hindered my experience to the point that I don't want to continue playing, and had caused me to lose all respect for whoever made this god awful decision.","Bought this with my girlfriend. I let her play first, after she went to bed started my own character... Playing anything other than first character in this game is a waste of time and boring. Nintendo please fix this and let us create more than one island!!!","It only allows for only 1 Island per Switch, wich makes player 2s gameplay experience limited. Every game has savestates. This is a joke. This was my last Nintendo Game","This game is really good. Those complaining about the whole one island thing and co-op **** Listen here, New leaf was the same way, City Folk, EVERYONE WAS A RESIDENT! It's been like this since day **** one but I guess now that it's the switch it's a problem. Even in New Leaf, it was like this, the first person was the mayor and the next people were just islanders, I don't understand why people are hating on this game for the same thing New Leaf did but not blaming that game. Second, the new leaf had no Co-op, no Animal crossing game up to this point had no one console Co-op, so at least it is a thing? I don't understand the point that people bring up, it's like they don't know **** and are just angry because they didn't do their research. Animal crossing is fun either way and honestly, all the stuff that you can do as the first player does not matter. Yes, I do wish that there could be more than one island but in all honesty, it does not matter to me. Yes, I know that that is not a valid argument but still, it's not as big of a deal as people make it out to be","Zero is as low as I can go? More like -100 Really Nintendo? One island per Switch? The first user has control over everything and all others are just residents WT Actual F! I am a single dad of two teenage girls and if you knew how much grief this has caused in my household  I do not play these games but I do pay for then and from now on you are second on my list of stuff to never buy again (#1 is Nike) If you think I am going to buy a second switch, game and online subscription just to stop the fighting and complaining you are crazy. I may not have control over what you do with your games and business but I do have control over my wallet and I do not have to buy any of your products ever again.","This game has ruined my girls. They are constantly fighting over it, to the point of physical violence because one was more \u2018superior\u2019 in the game. My oldest can apparently do more in the game and my younger daughter can do **** all. And the fact that this cash grab restricts you to one residential area per switch is disgusting. I loved Nintendo growing up, and loved the GameCube animal crossing but to see this new game ruin my family is horrible and Nintendo must be held accountable. shame on you Nintendo. I have also just been asked for a \u2018Switch online\u2019 supscription so my daughter can play with her friends . This is a ****ING MOCKERY. I payed $60 for this game and they\u2019re still asking me for money?! I\u2019m actually angry at myself for buying it for my daughters because there is constant violence in my house and this game is the root cause. I can not believe what Nintendo has turned into. Next time, remind me to buy a PlayStation so I don\u2019t see this capatilist greed.","I\u2019m changing my review from a 5/10 to a 9/10 simply because I was too ignorant to give the game more of a chance and now that I have I\u2019m genuinely enjoying the it.","This game is great and people are salty you can only have one island per console. I will take a point off because there isn\u2019t much to do in the late game but otherwise it is everything you\u2019d come to expect from a modern animal crossing game.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons joins titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a system seller. This isn\u2019t just a must-have title; it\u2019s a reason to buy a Nintendo Switch.\rI went into this game somewhat blind. I\u2019d seen some of the trailers, but this was my first time playing and owning an Animal Crossing game. Additionally, the simulation genre just isn\u2019t my cup of tea. The only other life simulator I\u2019d dabbled in was Stardew Valley(another great game).\rHowever, from the opening minutes, I knew this game would be special. It\u2019s probably the most relaxing game I\u2019ve ever played. After playing New Horizons and more recently, some excellent survival horror titles(Resident Evil 2 and 7), I\u2019ve realized you don\u2019t need fast paced action to make a game enjoyable. However, take that into consideration before purchasing/playing this game. It\u2019s very slow paced and unfortunately,  there is some unnecessary tedium. It would go a long way if a feature was added to craft sets of an item instead of crafting them individually(Tip: spam the A-button while crafting to speed up the process). Tool durability is also an unnecessary annoyance. Weapons durability suits a game like Breath of the Wild much better. It lets you experiment with the sandbox and make full use of all your items. That isn\u2019t the case in new horizons. Another minor gripe is playing with multiple accounts. You can only have one island per system. This wasn\u2019t an issue for me since I\u2019m the only one who plays my Switch, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you have young children, friends, a spouse/partner, or anyone else who wants their own island.\rLike I previously mentioned, this is an extremely slow paced game. Some Players used \u201ctime traveling\u201d to speed up the game, but I don\u2019t recommend that. I suggest you play how the developers intended.\rWith my (mostly)minor gripes out of the way, let\u2019s talk positives. First of all, this game is absolutely gorgeous. It may not quite reach Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, or Mario Kart 8 levels of beauty, but I\u2019d still put it in the top ten best looking games on the system. The art style is amazing, the lighting is top tier, and it ran at a solid 30 frames-per-second with no drops or stuttering from what I noticed. Sound design is as relaxing as it could be. The music is beautiful as well, although it might get on some players\u2019 nerves during extended play sessions, especially before town hall is built.\rIn terms of strength in gameplay, I\u2019ve never felt this much freedom in many other games. However, if I had to pinpoint my favorite aspect, it was probably collecting bugs, fossils,  fish, and other sea creatures, and donating them to the museum. It was always fun having friends visit my island and showing off all of the rare catches I\u2019d obtained. This was one of the few games where I displayed audible excitement whenever I caught a whale shark, sunfish, or oarfish for the first time.\rMore than many other games, New Horizons displays progress in a visual sense, rather than experience points, cool weapons, or armor. Your island will start out messy and overgrown with weeds and unwanted trees, but as the game moves forward, you\u2019ll unlock more villagers(and their respective houses), shops, and items to put on display. There are plenty of mindblowing islands on display on the internet, that even I(someone who played for more than 150 hours) couldn\u2019t begin to think of. It truly is your experience, and everyone\u2019s will be different.\rIf I had to point out one last gripe I had with the game, it would be updates. This review is being written almost 1 \u00bd years after launch, and although Nintendo has been consistently updating the game, it has lost a bit of longevity, but that\u2019s only because I played so frequently at the beginning of the pandemic and I possibly could\u2019ve been burnt out on it. You\u2019ll get plenty of hours out of the game, it\u2019s just after this many, there isn\u2019t as much of a reason to pick the game back up.\rDespite the minor issues I have with the game, I think this is a game anyone can enjoy. If you only like fast paced action, you should still give this one a try. I did, and I\u2019ve loved nearly every minute.","i really hope that one day they will translate the game into portuguese, they will make commercials in portuguese direct subtitled in portuguese but the game is never in portuguese, after the representative from latin america said that it is not a prority to translate console games, just translate those of mobile games, in short their priority and only the money, you know they do dubbed commercials but it doesn\u2019t translate the game for us, we are the biggest country in Latin America, I think they should listen to the fans more","It's decent but it gets to a point were you've done everything you can really do that day apart from just grinding bells and miles and have to wait till tomorrow to do more stuff. The neighbours don't seem to do anything and it's annoying. In New Leaf I remember them doing activities with you frequently but in the 2 full days I've played this game so far, nothing.\r I love Animal Crossing but this is a let down. Customising your character and island with more freedom is awesome but that's all there really is. Nothing fun to do.","The best Animal Crossing yet. Ignore all the 0s, it's a bunch of children **** about one or two features instead of calmly and reasonably reviewing the game in totality.","The people giving the game 0 are just wrong, its a fantastic game with 1 poor thing about it, the limitations but don't let that put you off.","this game straight up sucks nards. one island per a switch was BS now i just found out if you want to move a building slightly over from where you put it you have to pay 50000 bells to move it to a entirely new spot and then wait a day then pay an additional 50000 bells to move it where you wanted and wait another full day thats straight up retarded like wtf","New Horizons - Prehistoric Systems\r Bought the game as a lockdown treat for myself and my kids after we all fell in love with the idea of an island life.\r But that's not an option for two of us as only the first player gets to create an island.  I can't understand the design choice that results in this, other than Nintendo being desperate to sell more consoles.  This kind of thing happened on cartridge based games and was understandable to a degree but a console with plenty of storage and user accounts should not suffer with this kind of limitation.\r Poor show Nintendo.  If I could return the game for a refund I would.","This game is not a multiplayer game.it is frustrating and wasted my time because I'm not the first person on my switch to open this game. How about you mention that I'm the beginning: note: only player 1 gets progress. That would make everyone less angry. I never read reviews and bought this game and I only realized 2 weeks in and a ton for resources collected only to realize I can't progress because player one has all the power and everyone else player 2 in my case is stuck to having 0 investment. My other player who started this game first rarely plays because they work a lot , so this is kind of stupid. I can't progress even if I play more unless player one plays and unlocks everything. What is even the point of calling this a multiplayer game??? PATCH THIS BC THIS IS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I didn't read reviews before we started which is a big mistake on my part, I had to learn it the hard way, wasted my time on this .","The first player is the only player that can actually progress on the island making playing as player 2 feel like your not part of the story and the island. I understand why making only one island per console but, with this problem making multiple islands a thing seems like a plausible solution. Needs Fix Nintendo. pls fix","The game is fun to play, but once again Nintendo fumbles online which is why my review is a 5.","The game is absolutely lovely but the couch multiplayer is so poorly implemented it will lead to divorce. Half the game, if you\u2019re playing it with another player half the game is waiting for them to do stuff. Also, you have to walk back to the recycling bin all the time as even though the other villagers have their own inventory,\u2019 it\u2019s so poorly implemented. They should have honestly kept it single player rather than shoehorning this dumpster fire of cooperation in. If you want a better co-op game, try luigi\u2019s mansion, or get another switch to play this with a friend.","Qid dos PuLmana dosparagarina de mu torana jgangna polama Krunora pos dojfara!!!!","This is a rather early on review, as I have been playing for 4 days and I'm sure a lot is subject to change. There are a lot of great improvements from older versions of the game, but unfortunately a lot is lacking, which takes away from the overall gameplay. I will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect, as I am playing alone on my Switch, and am not encountering problems, though I can totally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console/island. The game is built unfairly for those people.\r The game does not have hourly music, which is something previous Animal Crossing games are known for. I miss having quirky, hourly tracks, but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly. The objective based system is a nice touch, but unfortunately doesn't feel rewarding, and does not lead to any larger objective. Gyroids also are not present in the game, and I REALLY hope they come out with an update.\r The game has a slow paced system, which is OK and echoes the Animal Crossing feel, but the delay of introducing characters/villagers/buildings/etc leads to a heavy lack in content. Who knows, maybe they weren't expecting people to have so much time due to the Corona lockdown! I am a bit disappointed that I'm already starting to feel bored after 4 days, especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time.\r I'm hoping a lot of these problems will be \"fixed\" by either playing the game for a longer period of time, or updates. I'm hoping Nintendo will not push heavy paid DLC packages for this game...","Charming &amp; fun! If you\u2019ve played an Animal Crossing game before you\u2019ll know what to expect, if you haven\u2019t, expect a relaxing journey building your own island paradise day by day in real time.","Co-op is a draconic system dredged from the recesses of 2002, But the nintendo diehards will eat up any slop.","For a $60 game, my whole family should be able to have their own game. I kinda feel duped. Sharing an Island!! Really!! Im not going to buy multiple copies of the same games and multiple $400 game stations for individual accounts. Nintendo has gotten so **** greedy. This isnt hard to change . The company should fix this. Thr game itself is really fun, but this inconvenience makes it very disappointing.","To be the second player who boots the game is to have a worse game. I can\u2019t believe this is how the game should be played. You can\u2019t do anything as the second player this is equivalent of getting the mad catz-controller when gaming as a child. This is a game for lonely people only. If you live with someone and share a Switch, don\u2019t even bother. You can\u2019t even return digitally bought games.","Don\u2019t waste your money if you share your switch with anyone. The game has a terrible multiplayer design. There is only one island allowed per switch, with all the players who did not originally start the island not having nearly as much power as the one who started the island. All other players have no ability to move forward in the story and must wait for the main player to do so. The only way to get around this problem is to buy a new switch and a new copy of the game. This is something Nintendo set up just to scam people out of way more money than the game is actually worth. Greedy pigs. I mean $80 for a game that only one person can play and that somewhat resembles a game I could buy on my phone for a couple bucks. Don\u2019t waste your money on this scam.","It is the first time that Nintendo releases a game with so many bugs, as much as the game looks nice, the bugs are incredible, my words would be the same as the other users who have complained about the bugs.","I want my own Island is that to much to ask for $79. Not happy, really disappointed that they did this to us, I was really looking forward to playing this with my family. Having to share an island between all of us has just made us all frustrated.","My brother bought this game for me as a gift but he was the first to launch it, before we knew that the game was one island per console which was kind of a bummer but we were fine with it being shared until I played by my self and realized I could not do anything on the island without him.

Its cute, fun, addicting, and charming. The main complaint that i see from people is that you are limited to 1 island per console.

Overall the game is fantastic and i cant wait to see whats in store for the seasons and events!","The island being linked to the console is ridiculous.  I'd be willing to buy a second cartridge for a new island.  You aren't squeezing another console out of me Nintendo.  You need to fix this.  It does suck because this would be an awesome game if all four of the people in my house that want to play can have their own island!","There are no events in the game. Even the holydays. The world feels empty and grey. All provious parts of AC series definetly better","Played first 3 days (20,21,22 March). The island starts with TWO villagers and only Nook 3.  Can't even access the whole island.  Can't buy tools. No clothing or furniture stores.  Extremely boringNook miles gives alerts when you do basic tasks, but it just insists the game is fun.  The trailer is way further into gameplay.  You have to build everything yourself and you aren't even mayor anymore.  No personality of other games and this cost 60 damn dollars","Yes I'm the 2nd player. The glorified visitor. The meaningless additional resident only spending time fishing, catching bugs and stuff without giving an impact to the story..","I cannot stress enough how dumb half these reviews are. The fact that most of these reviews tunnel vision on only the \"1 island\" rule set is absurd. This is why a lot of user reviews are dismissed purely because of this.\r I for one don't seem phased by this, neither do a few of my other friends. BESIDES the fact, the game's mechanics feel smooth and easygoing. I like the progress of the \"story\" is provides, and the progression of the island over time. If I were going to complain about a missing feature though, is the fact that multi-select is not a thing when it comes to putting stuff away in your home storage. Other than that, the game feels very well done in spite of all the negative reviews it has.\r I feel like Nintendo will fix this just to mitigate the number of complaints people are throwing at them. But this won't stop people from attacking it from base release...","Poor game designToo many wasted conversation dialogCompare to dragon quest builder this game is very poor.Multiplayer on is very nightmare diffcult and wasted timeSo manything to be improved","One of the many super annoyed people at the first person to play the game is the only one who can progress it!

We're getting bored already of this and I'm nothing but disappointed at nintendo for screwing us over like this.","Having access to only 1 island per console is completely ridiculous. I\u2019m not trying to share this **** with my kid. Her stuff is already all over my house. Get her off my island lol.","One island per switch... smh. This needs to change. This is why this game is rated 5","I've been a fan of the Animal Crossing series for a long time; I had the gamecube when I was little and I still carry my 3DS in my bag. I wanted an app long before an AC app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out I waited. And waited. And here it finally is!!! Beautiful graphics, wonderful old characters, amazing new mechanics, a perfect game, as expected. If you live alone... Some people are saying that Nintendo did this out of greed but I wonder if it wasn't to try and force a style of gameplay on us they want us to use. If so, it's childish and controlling and petty. If not, then yeah, it's greedy. People aren't happy with this not because we can't get along and learn to coexist, but because exploring individual freedoms are what creativity, and therefore this game, are all about. I let my boyfriend play instead. I've already had many great experiences and I wanted this one to be for him, but after 275 dollars for the switch and then 60 for the game, I shouldn't HAVE to sacrifice like that. Nintendo has a pretty solid track record of having great ideas and then ruining them. And you'd think that because of the switch shortage from the virus that this would be as good a time as ever for Nintendo to let it go and let us have our own islands since no one can really find or afford another 300 dollar console to play on. Not that they should have to. I'm surprised people haven't resorted to stealing them out of spite. Even if Nintendo had the dignity and wisdom to fix this mistake, the game is still ruined for me. That first time experience of opening up the game and discovering all it has to offer was smeared the first time I logged in as player two. I'll never have that back. I feel resentful and angry and disappointed. I keep seeing other people play their games on my social media feed and it's frustrating. I'm missing out on the sakura trees, I'm missing out on the festivals and the seasons and my birthday is in early May. I had at least hoped this game would allievate the stress of being an essential worker on my birthday but I guess not.","One island? One star. Game was enjoyable until someone else in the house wanted to play.","A fantastic addition to the Animal Crossing series.

She doesn\u2019t play as much as me but wanted the game so she played first. Now every single day I have to wait for her and let her do everything first so she can unlock me the necessary items. She puts buildings in random locations while I like more organized things and it\u2019s not fair that we spent 100s on a switch and 60 on the game and I can\u2019t even experience it fully. Completely ruined the games experience for me as I can\u2019t unlock anything, can\u2019t move anything,  can\u2019t place buildings and inclines,  and can\u2019t even talk to Tom nook the same way.","WATCH GAMEPLAY BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!! This game is not for everyone, certainly it wasn't for me i got trapped in the hyptrain that Reddit generated towards this game and the Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal cross over that happened, but man this game is BORING AS FU***. Everything take a **** ton of time, you require pacience and hard work, witch for someone like me that plays video games to scape reality after a long day of work this is bs. Sure slaying demons with a shotgun might be ridiculous concept but it's fun.","Don't listen to the salty review bombers.The game is nice. It's relaxing and you can really get caught up in the collecting aspect of it. There are only two big issues for me:1) They still haven't integrated an in-game time travel system yet, despite the fact that you can only play about ~30 minutes to an hour every day if you don't time travel using the Switch's system settings. This is frustrating because the developers know very well that half (if not more) of the players playing the game will time travel anyway, so refusing to make it an in-game mechanic seems like stubbornness. A lot of time is wasted when you have to save, close the game, go to system settings, change the time and re-open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day.2) As I had feared when the game was announced, the game sadly is not worth the $60 price tag, no matter how you split it. What it does do, it does perfectly, just like all the Animal Crossing games before it, but it just doesn't do enough to warrant the nearly-doubled price compared to New Leaf. There are apps on iOS that legitimately have more content than this game, and this game cost me a whole day's wages. In short, if you're a die hard Animal Crossing fan, you'll probably love this game, but then again, if you really are, then you were going to love it regardless of what I said. If you have not played Animal Crossing before and are looking into it, I would advise against getting New Horizons unless you are flush with cash. You'll get the same experience by buying one of the earlier, cheaper Animal Crossings or a comparable game like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon.","\"One Dictator, Seven Slaves\" same-console multiplayer is a huge disappointment. We bought this game to *share* it- one island, one screen, shared decisions and contribution","It is actually a great game but has a huge major flaw that literally can ruin it and Nintendo needs to fix it so what happened to me with this is I bought the game but I was at work the day it came out so I couldn\u2019t play it but my sister started the game so now I can\u2019t do the main quests of the game I **** bought unless I steal my sisters account or **** start over literally no reason for this at all it\u2019s a hella easy fix, either add multiple islands or saves or just **** let other players do the main Tom nook town development quests.","The 1 island limit killed the game for me. It`s annoying not being able to design my own island when sharing the switch with other users.","I was so excited to play this game but only to found out that the game is limited to ONE ISLAND per console. SERIOUSLY!? I don\u2019t get to name anything, upgrade anything or own anything. What\u2019s the purpose of playing this game if you\u2019re not player one? I started the game on my sisters island and there was NOTHING left for me to do. WORST DESIGN OF THE YEAR! I had more fun playing a PS3 game released in 2010. Never quit a game this fast in my life.","No me gust\u00f3 es horrible, creo que mejor hubiera sido que no vendan cart\u00f3n a 400 euros.","one island? returning now. not buying a second switch just so my wife can also play the $60 game we paid for.","A lot to love about this game. I don't understand how in 2020 we are limited to one file (island) per Nintendo switch. My wife and I had a blast with Pokemon, being able to enjoy our play throughs separately but still had that sense of camaraderie in Pokemon Home. I want to give this game a 9. I really did enjoy every moment in game, but its almost game breaking when you have another person wanting to play but has to literally take a back seat. You better not make your brother or sister mad, could end up wasting a lot of your well earned bells.","You are searching something to play during coronavirus, certainly this is not the game you want to play during this period.This is the MOST BORING GAME i ever played. If you are searching something new, maybe you just buyed a new switch, THIS IS NOT THE GAME YOU WANT TO BUY!!!!If you are not interested in life simulation, creativity or virtual friendship DONT BUY THIS GAME, DONT EVEN TRY IT!WORST 50\u20ac SPENT.I PREFER TO PLAY FORTNITE INSTEAD OF THIS SH! T.","for evryone who hates the fact u can only have one island.\ranimal crossing has always been this way stop complaining.","Be aware of I restriction per one console. Ony one of lucky one from household will get full experience of game.","10 because of how the game forces players to socialize on Discord, Facebook groups, or anywhere that offers chances to earn more bells, increase their catalog, or play around by collecting villagers while allowing introverts the option to grind away on crafting materials and collectibles. It really doesn't punish the impatient ones for changing the date and time on System Settings because everyone does it anyway. I couldn't ask for a better way to kill time on the Switch/Switch Lite.","Best game of Nintendo history. The GOTY 2020. Nintendo is a factory of amazing and perfect videogames. And ACNH is their best master game.","Great game, play it so much.  It does have some problems like having to have a separate switch to have separate islands, and lack of bulk crafting.","Game of the year, one of the best installments in the whole series. Anyone who has enjoyed this series will absolutely love this game. It is very deep and well paced with almost endless ways of having fun.","Only first player can create an island, it is an actual issue for others, but not for me and should still be fixed. This game has a lot of charm and some fun, but a lot of the charm is stepped on by how overly tedious the game is and how terrible the programmers are on a technical side. Want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event? Well, welcome to about 10 minutes of loading screens because every person who comes in NEEDS to essentially reset the island and have a giant loading screen.\r It isn't just when it comes to playing online, it is just about every aspect from finding certain characters and needing to prompt dialogue with them 5x to get to the right spot (let's pretend that programmers can't make dialogue a continuous thing lol) or trying to fish and the fish moving a little bit out of your way and having to cast the line with little to no aim. You constantly miss shovel spots, hit spots, balloons, and so many things because the way the game is designed is just... very incredibly poor.\r The developers basically see traditional gaming and try to piss on it, which is fine and dandy, but what's left is a technically bad game with overly tedious moments that take control of the game 95% of the play. It seems like Nintendo hired 3rd year programming students who have some help from veterans on how to get stuff done, but overall you can tell the programmers in this game are just daft and at the end of their wits, which is why it also doesn't shock me that it is one island per Switch, it's literally them being incapable of programming that logic into the game.","I wanted to try out Animal Crossing because of the fans.  I played for about a week and while relaxing, I started to realize it wasn't my kind of game.  It was just too simplistic in what you could do in the game.  I know the game expands later but it just took too much time for me to get there without the feeling of incentive to come back.  It also felt a bit too kiddish for me.  The slow progression of the game was really too slow for me and just felt like there wasn't much game there.  Also, the villagers wouldn't say much of interest and repeat the same things, and while I like games where you have to figure out things on your own, it also wasn't very intuitive on what to do at times for new players to the series.  In my experience, it felt very half baked.  The core gameplay felt like what I could do in other games which are a lot more fun, varied, and engaging.  The one main plus was the cute, polished hd visuals.","Algumas melhorias s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias, como o excesso de di\u00e1logos, mas \u00e9 um jogo que me faz querer jogar todos os dias e sem press\u00e3o","I cannot play a game I bought, the way I want, simply because Nintendo has placed greed above all other priorities. I cannot play because someone else in my household owns a copy and we share a switch. Limit it to one island per cartridge, that's fine. But one per console? Take a step back Nintendo and rethink your decision.","So I've managed to rack up more than 170 hours in this game so far, making it my most played game of the year so far.\r I also think one island per console is a huge annoyance but it's not worth giving the game a 0/100 (ya big babies)\r I start off I only played a small amount of new leaf before this game so I was going into this game with little to no knowledge. So I'm no long time fan of the series or anything or the sort.\r I guess I'll start off with the pros:\r -This game is so damn peaceful.\r-Despite the slow progress at the start of the game it never leaves you bored, it leaves you wanting more.\r-The progression of your island is entirely up to you.\r-The detail of the graphics, animations and lighting is absolutely gorgeous, a huge step forward from previous games.\r- The ability to terraform is a big bonus (although it has its own issues).\r- If you are a collector/achievement hunter (which I most definitely am), this game will give you plenty to work towards.\r So with plenty to do and more to do than ever, what could go wrong... right??\rWell a lot apparently.\rThe cons!!:\r -While crafting is a huge step forward for the series, as well as all the benefits it gives. It is the single most tedious experience I have experienced in a long time. It is also the worst part of this game. Why do I have to craft one item at a time, and whyyyyyy does it take so long to craft that ONE item? I spent (and I counted) 7 minutes making\rtwenty fish bait.\r -The tools have no durability bar so you can never tell when they're about to break.\r - Of course one island per console is a massive pain in the ass. It's obviously used to get more people to buy their consoles and I guess it works. So great job Nintendo marketing team! (ya knobs).\r -Terraforming can turn your island into a beautiful paradise, but it's going to be hell before you get there. It feels clunky to use. You will hit the wrong patch is dirt 9 times before hitting the right one. It's just an all round mess right now and needs a serious overhaul.\r -While you can track your bugs and fish, you can't track the fossils you have donated, which was in the last game so I have no earthly idea why they removed it.\r -Villagers personality types are far too similar to other villagers. I'm sick of hearing three separate villagers talk about \"the bugs in their floor\". There needs to be more diversity between each villager.\r FINALLY, this is not giving nintendo flack for making a shoddy game, I think it's beautiful, addictive and a great way to blow off steam. So I'm just going to give some suggestions the game needs in the future.\r -The ability to craft multiple items at a time.\r-Manilla clams stacking.\r-More buildings/shops to build from Tom Nook (Like the coffee shop, or disco).\r-Tracking fossils\r-An easier way to terraform\r-The ability to boot a villager from your island instead of ignoring them for 2 months.\r-Durability bars for tools\r-Less frequent rain. My island is starting to look like a jungle.\r-Less time it takes to go to another island, seriously I spent probably 3 minutes talking to orville.\r-An auto-sort option for my inventory.\r You'll see that 90% of these are just quality of life features. Which is exactly what the game needs. I don't care about a diving update if the game continues this way.\r Well that rant is over. Hope nintendo read this stuff... they probably don't... BUT MAYBE THEY DO... nah they don't.","Honestly, most of the haters and complainers of the game is people who had played more than 500 hours in less than a year, begging form more content in a 50$ with no DLCs game. It\u00b4s absurd. The game gives you a crazy amount of content and hours of fun. Relax and enjoy it, and remember, it is just a game!","i wanted to play with my daughter and go to visit islands of each other but nintendo is too greedy. Shame nintendo!","Playing this game for one week now (without time-cheating), I still have fun, and appreciate the new tasks and changes that I see every day.\r But I am unsure how long this will last.\rI' already very disinterested in what the characters have to say.\rThe job of collecting resources (fish, wood, fruit, bugs) in order to grow the town or get new stuff feels more and more like a joyless grind.\r Especially crafting / buying objects is senseless.\rYou can't use ANYTHING except a few simple music instruments.\rBicycles, lawn mowers, Scooters, toys .... nothing is interactive, everything is just to look at.\r The only thing in this game that you can do besides gathering resources and  placing furniture is ...\rsitting down on things.\r I wish I could tell you how the multiplayer is, but I have no idea.\rNintendo doesn't let me play this game online.\rI have a huge list of friends that own and play this game.\rBut there is no way to connect with them.\r It seems like I would need to know how to contact those people IN REAL LIFE and then give\rthem a special generated code to invite them to my island.\rJust let me invite people from my friend list PLEASE.\r Graphics, animation, sound design and atmosphere are all fine.\rBut tasks like growing plants, fishing or mining minerals feel very shallow and unrewarding in comparison to Stardew Valley.\rAnimal Crossing could learn a lot from that game.","I  Disappointed with the game. It's kind of a boring game. Not much to do for the most part and doing stuff feel's empty. I feel like it takes a very long time to get anything done. You get to the point were you have a large stack of crafting materials then half of what you would usually do is gone.","This is arguably the best Animal Crossing yet, but for returning players it might be a pretty disappointing experience.I somehow wish this could be my first AC experience, as the game is full of things to discover and do, and undoubtedly has that animal crossing magic of the previous games.Unfortunately, it also is plagued by the same annoyances of the previous games such as the cumbersome interface, and it does not add a whole lot of new and interesting gameplay mechanics and improvements to entertain returning animal crossing veterans. To me, it seems like nintendo was a bit lazy with this one.I was really looking forward to this game, but after a week of playing it, its hard to shake the thought im essentially playing a game that hasnt changed any core mechanics to entertain long time players. Which sucks, as i would have loved  to dive into animal crossing once again, but there is just too little incentive for me to go on my third animal crossing adventure.Tldr: been there, done that","\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e-\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f) \u041a\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u044d\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u043a \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0443 Nintendo Switch, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438 \u043a \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0443. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0451\u0437\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435)","Animal Crossing: New Horizons - 2020 - Play Time: 370 hours (and going)\r Start this off by saying this type of game is not for everyone. But for the ones who enjoy Animal Crossing or \"Slice of Life\" games, its a amazing game that came out when the world needed it most. Right at the start of the worldwide pandemic, ACNH released and allowed us to enjoy a virtual life while being forced to stay indoors.\rA simple groundwork of starting off on a isolated paradise island; You are tasked by Tom Nook to help develop your island to a livable home that people will want to come visit and live at. Finding all sorts of villagers along the way to come move to your island. There is almost 400 different villagers you can find that range in personalities and looks. Try to be nice to the non kawaii ones. They have feelings too. Besides Shari.\rA game that never really \"ends\" I was debating on when to write a review but I have achieved a 5 Star Rating Island and now have began to try and catalog all items in the game. There have been a couple updates and each one adds in something new to experience. This game is a enjoyable work of art that can easily be viewed as a stress relief. It also holds a special place for me as me and my girlfriend like to play it together and hold little special dates when we have the time.\rWell done Nintendo.","A very good game, in which you can relax and play a bit every day. The only bad thing would be the late game, after so many hours you do not have so much to do and it gets monotonous.\r About the limitation of only one island I don't think it interferes with the experience. Just enjoy the game .","this game is very fun it has a charming look and fun mechanics crafting I feel is well implemented in a well understood way","Los cero usuarios que jam\u00e1s han tocado un juego de nintendo ni Xbox, pero ya ingorando a los haeters, es un juego genial que te va llevar un buen rato distracci\u00f3n.","El juego sigue siendo lo de siempre han cambiado algo aqu\u00ed algo all\u00e1, ha perdido cosas esenciales por el camino, el hecho de que las herramientas se est\u00e9n rompiendo a cada rato es un encordio, y el sistema de Islas aleatorias es penoso. Entiendo que las mejores islas como la isla de las tarantulas no salgan a menudo pero que de 30 veces que he ido de viaje las 30 me haya salido una isla random con la misma fruta y las mismas flores, eso es penoso y est\u00e1 mal hecho te dan ganas de dejar de jugar","For the first 80 hours or so, this is the best Animal Crossing there's ever been. It feels like there's so much to do, and new features like moving buildings, placing furniture outside, increased creativity tools, etc. make the game so enjoyable to play. However, the longer you play, the more you realize that - in comparison to Animal Crossing games in the past - there's really not much to do/not much content in the game.\r For any other game, being enjoyable for 80 hours would be amazing, but Animal Crossing has always been designed to be a game which can be enjoyed essentially for as many years as you want. But there's just not enough to do in New Horizons - a ridiculous amount has been cut from previous games, with not enough new things added to make up for it. I imagine Nintendo's plan is to add these things back as free content updates, which is understandable from their perspective as it will keep people playing the game, but there's just not enough content in the base game to keep the game feeling fun and not like a chore to play everyday. Additionally, the villagers have been watered down so much that dialogue is repeated almost constantly, and the characters barely have any personality anymore.\r However, the game still gets a 8/10 from me, because for the first 80 hours or so it's the most fun I've had with a game in such a long time!","Very calming, super unique and just a great game to relax and turn your head of for a while. It's very cute and super satisfying to create your own island and collect all the things. Only thing that seriously annoys me are the long dialogues which can be a little painful if you have to click through the same exact dialogue for the 14-th time.","Very solid Animal Crossing experience! Gotta love all the new customization options. That said the game isn't flawless, like how it feels to have taken away some things from earlier games(Like multiple upgrades of the Nook's Cranny, now there's just one), or releasing holidays only as patches, which might be a bit annoying to people with limited internet connections.\r On another note though, I really hate how certain idiotic pseudo fans harrassed the localization/development team of the game into removing any references to your character's gender in english localization. Hopefully they stop giving in to them, and instead listen to actual fans who play the game, rather than scum who think video games should be used to propagate their political agendas.","When the game released in March 2020 I played 30 hours in the first two weeks. I liked it well enough but I wasn't really hooked and I eventually stopped playing it. Until July 2021 that is, when I decided to boot it again and now I'm totally hooked. I put in the effort to unlock terraforming and then the game becomes a brand new game. I initially decided to spread villagers houses all over the island, but now I'm in the process of reshaping my entire island, with a residential area, a town business district, flowery parks with a little lake, a big camping lake, a forest full of waterfalls, and I also placed my house far away from the town in the hills and I want to make it bigger and better furnished. Basically, once you find the motivation to make a great and beautiful island to your tastes, you become hooked and it's a very soothing game. It draws you in like no other game did for me.\r Of course, the game is not perfect. I wish Nintendo would bring some much needed quality of life improvements, such as bulk crafting, bulk buying, being able to craft in your house with items stored in your house and not only those stored in your pockets. Also, skipping already seen dialogues. It's currently a game of patience to suffer through Blathers' interminable blabber when you just want to identify and donate a fossil. And that, every time ! I wonder if this is done by design or if Nintendo just doesn't bother making player's lives easier. Bottom line, it is annoying that Nintendo doesn't address those problems, but they don't prevent the enjoyment of the game, far from it.\r I'm not playing online so I can't comment on online issues. Also, concerning the one island per console thing, let me just say that I absolutely don't approve of Nintendo's decision to allow only one island per console instead of one island per profile. This seems totally arbitrary and anti-consumer. I am personally not concerned by this and I enjoy the game immensely, I think it is deserving of a 9/10. But I can understand the frustration of people sharing a Switch and wanting to both play the game.","This game is far from perfect, but it doesn't deserved the zeros. It's a great game to pass time especially in a time like this. Thanks for this game for giving us a sense of escapism","I bought this to play with my daughter. Unfortunately Nintendo messed up with playing 2 on 1 console. I can't go through the main story like the first player. I'm restricted to wait for that and basically need to buy another switch and another copy of the game. That's useless. Otherwise the game is good though...","Es impresionante lo divertido que es, las horas se pasan volando. Cada detalle es perfecto, para m\u00ed es el juego del a\u00f1o.","This is a game that is held back by the fact that it is essentially a beta with constant updates rolling out. I will say, I love animal crossing. I've been playing since the gamecube version and have always loved the charm of having a little town you can escape to. The anthropomorphic animals that become your friends is always welcome in my home and New Horizons delivers on the original concept better than ever before. I've heard critics call this iteration the \"Breath of the Wild\" of Animal Crossing. I can agree. Never before has there been this much customizability and control of your village. Let me start with some of the positives. First, let me talk about some quality of life improvements that aren't commonly talked about. Your villagers never leave in this game unless you prompt them to leave. This is amazing. Especially from the perspective of someone who likes to play the markets. There is an intrinsic value placed on certain villagers depending on how in-demand they are. In previous games, they would move out unprompted and there was nothing you could do to get them back short of buying their respective amiibo cards. Next, the crafting system is just wonderful and plays well in the new improved atmosphere of New Horizons. It adds a bit of whimsy and character to a series already chock full of the stuff. Now some negatives. As people can see by the review score, you're locked into one island per switch. Which isn't that crazy considering that has been the take of Animal Crossing historically. The biggest thing that knocks it down from being a perfect game for me is the fact that the content wasn't all there upon release. Animal crossing requires long-term dedication for hours a day (within the first few months of this game I have over 300+ hours on my save) and the game can start to feel a little stale by the time a new content update is released. While the charm and whimsy certainly make-up for this fact. There's too many triple-A releases coming out to justify the enormous dedication it takes to do everything you want in this game. All-in-all, it's an excellent experience and if you own a switch, this is a must-have.","This is the best Animal Crossing game I\u2019ve played. The repetitive tasks are tedious at times but I play every single day.","This is the first Animal Crossing I\u2019ve ever played. I love similar games so I thought I will give this a try. However, it\u2019s not as funs as I had hoped.\r The game has a lot of charm and give me that relaxing and laid back feeling that I was looking for. Though it somehow feels a little lackluster. It stats out very slow and progressively gets better. But it never reaches a high enough point that I feel drawn to it. Most things get repetitive fast and it doesn\u2019t feel as rewarding as I would like. It\u2019s also to simple for my taste, both when it comes to difficulty and depth.\r I still play it for a few minutes every day, though it does not provide as much enjoyment compared to other games. I don\u2019t regret the purchase, but It\u2019s not a game I would recommend to likeminded individuals. However, I can see how it can be enjoyable to some people.","Cast: 6/10\rStory: 6/10\rFun: 9/10\rGameplay: 8/10\r Recommended\r----------------------","Es el primer juego que tengo el honor de probar en la saga. Mi primer Animal Crossing; y la verdad, no puedo creer la experiencia que he vivido durante estos meses. Un juego que propone un concepto sencillo, vivir el d\u00eda a d\u00eda, hacer cosas de rutina, pero que es profundamente adictivo y te llama a estar constantemente remodelando tu Isla, o tu casa, y preocup\u00e1ndote de tus vecinos. Adem\u00e1s este juego tiene un significado nuevo en estos tiempos de cuarentena, donde el distanciamiento social nos quita la posibilidad de conectarnos con otros. De momento, el mejor juego de Switch del a\u00f1o.","Nunca habia jugado un animal crossing y he de decir que me ha resultado super divertido, tiene una facilidad enorme para engancharte y que pasen las horas volando.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game, but does have some downsides.\r I have been playing this game over 2 weeks now and I love it. gathering fossils, fishing, bug catching and as of now the bunny day(week) event.  As i have seen online most people had their island mostly done by time traveling, as for me i will be not time traveling . But this is a game that keeps me coming back and slowly watching my island grow with each new finished project or a new guest comes and visits the island. But as i am playing game it can/gets boring after 2 hours of gameplay,  but because there only so much you can do in a real time game.\r But overall If you are big Fan or new comer to Animal Crossing series this a game that is worth checking picking up.\r Will update later in the year!","el juego es entretenido, empieza bastante lento pero termina enganchandote, gr\u00e1ficamente muy bonito, lo recomiendo bastante si eres una persona solitaria y sin mucha actividad social, perfecto para la cuarentena,entiendo que la experiencia de juego no es la misma para todos los usuaria de la misma consola, pero mi calificaci\u00f3n la e basado en la experiencia de un solo jugador en una sola consola, de ese modo el juego es uma delicia!, ya le tocara a mi pareja calificar con un 0 del lado del un usuaria segund\u00f3n","New Horizons is a great game, with plenty of personality and charm, and really bright and cheery visual design that is sadly held down by some UI and pacing problems. Despite this, it proves to be one of the Switch's best titles.","Ok, Nintendo only allows one island per switch, as outlined in all negative reviews, but this is really the best game ever! I now own 3 switches and 3 copies of the game to have my whole family visit each other. It is so nice to have all little chores without violence and stress. No in-app-purchases too. All money is just \u2018earned\u2019 in the game. There are so many things to build, so many to animals to collect. It is really genius that Redd sells genuine and fake art. It will teach children to look close at art and notice details. There is just too much to do. This game justifies buying another switch and game copy!","Es muy entretenido y no se termina en 5-6 horitas de juego me gusta todos mis amigos lo tienen","Lo acabo de comprar y no puedo parar de jugar. Es adictivo y muy tierno sus personajes.","The art style and design of characters and objects have always complemented each other in this franchise, the contrast between the life-like fish, fossils and bugs and the chibi-like villagers and animals greatly appeals to the eye. One thing that keeps bugging me about this game is the lack of character development between the player of the game and his neighbours. In older Animal Crossing games, your animal neighbours were strangers, and as strangers would act, they wouldn't instantly like you or be instantly gratuitous towards you. This made them personified in a way, they were more characteristic and the bond you formed with them felt more real. However, in this game, although the villagers are more expressive and DO more  natural things, they FEEL almost robotic in the ways they act towards you, they say the same things, they feel the same way. It doesn't feel like they are truly happy when they are, or when they're angry, or when they're sad. But, even with that in mind, this game is still an amazing experience\r Nintendo, make the characters more characteristic. Please.\r It has gone from Life Sim (+Collectathon)\rTo Collectathon (+Life Sim)\r Anyways, I gotta get back to playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf on my Nintendo 3DS.","This game deserves a better score. This is a game which made me feel happy and relaxing. All the characters and most of the designs within it are curing me. Tough I did not spend a lot of time digging into the game, I have played more than 100 hours. In addition, I'm not the main player of the island, but I'm fine with it since I'm not playing a lot, and I still feel this is a good game. My girlfirend, who is the owner of the island, has played more than 500 hours, which means this can be a very attractive game for some players. If you feel you want the full control of the game, and want to spend a lot of time on it, you should buy a switch for it. For me, although I'm not the main player, it does not ruin my game experience, and it even makes me feel easier.","(No he jugado los juegos anteriores) La verdad, el juego me encanto, me imagino que es porque tuve la oportunidad de tener una isla para mi solo y jugarlo en paralelo con mi hermano. el hecho de poder ir viendo como el otro progresa junto a ti y poder compartir conocimientos, es maravilloso. Respecto al juego en si, esta bastante bien, ya que que el sistema de progreso en el juego, esta bien implementado, teniendo que esperar al siguiente d\u00eda para poder avanzar, impidiendo que se haga una experiencia corta. La personalizaci\u00f3n es bastante buena, pudiendo cambiar; la forma y color de los ojos, la forma y color del pelo, distintas zapatillas, pantalones, accesorios para la cabeza (sombreros, gorras, mascarillas, etc.), y lo mas importante (desde mi punto de vista), poder personalizar tus propios polerones, camisas, chaquetas, poleras (con o sin mangas), y a la vez, poder descargar dise\u00f1os de otros jugadores y compartir tus dise\u00f1os. Tu isla puede cambiar demasiado, existen much\u00edsimos esquemas distintos que sirven para fabricar una gran variedad de art\u00edculos, grandes y peque\u00f1os, para ambientar como tu quieras tu isla. un punto muy d\u00e9bil, es la nula presencia del cooperativo, limit\u00e1ndose a una isla por pantalla, la raz\u00f3n por la que esto no le bajo mas la nota, fue porque no interfiri\u00f3 con mi experiencia, pero comprendo a las personas que si. En conclusi\u00f3n es un juego bastante did\u00e1ctico, duradero y personalizable, pero si quieres disfrutarlo con otra persona, vas a tener que tener dos nintendo switch y dos copias del juego","This is my first Animal Crossing game and I've been having a lot of fun with it.","The complaints about progression if you're player 2+ are entirely valid and I have a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process that led to those design decisions without chalking it up to stupidity or incompetence. If you don't care about having only a single island per console, or only one player who can progress the story--which I don't, I was honestly glad to not have to deal with that--then you still have to contend with the issues of being unable to build bridges or craft really basic furniture. On top of that, the controls are awful, dialog is incredibly repetitive and tedious, and for a game whose entire purpose is decorating your island, this has the worst customization options imaginable short of not actually offering any at all. If you don't believe me, then feel free to stop by my house full of urinals and giant baseball helmets because I can't buy a bed or a proper table.\r This game was only a success because it coincided with a devastating global pandemic, and the previous installments were apparently even more boring and stupid. Neither of those are claims to fame that I personally would want.","Astoundingly good.  Improves on the Animal Crossing formula to a state of near perfection.","It is not a multiplayer game. it is a single-player game where others can visit and support your Island. That's it. No method to change Residents or share Residency. Tech support had zero solutions. My wife and I allowed our son to play the game first and it is now unplayable for us. I'd get a refund if I could. We bought it as a multiplayer game and shared family experience.","Juego que puede llegar a ser a veces divertido pero que carece de contenido","Excelente, super divertido y adictivo, la jugabilidad ha superado de lejos la versi\u00f3n anterior.","What? Why such a low score for users? Seeing the number before reviewing this is like wtf? I\u2019ve been waiting for this game since switch was released. From the wild world, to new leaf and now to this. Witnessing the improvements was just nostalgic. To be able to terraform and design your island is so amazing. Amazing game for quarantine days. This is a chill game so to fully appreciate everything is not to play fast like timetravelling. You don\u2019t need to beat anything. That\u2019s why even if the updates are slow, I love how they drop it one a time so as not to get bored easily. Live the life as an islander/villager. Though I\u2019m still waiting for my favorite barista, Brewster. Giving it an 8 coz New Leaf\u2019s Tortimer island visiting, Retail store and kicks shop were still my fav. And I\u2019ve got to be the mayor then.","This was a title that really surprised me. I've had so much fun getting into the world and gameplay experience. Hours upon hours of designing and decorating my island life never felt so satisfied and relaxing. This truly is a great game to play during this crisis known as COVID.","Aparte que me ha gustado mucho y sigo jugando, en serio hay gente que pone 0 a los juegos por joder y punto? Que frikis","Bought this on a whim, never played any Animal crossing games.\r Played non stop and on 65 hours already. I really have no idea why i cant stop playing this game.\r For some reason the game sucks you in. If you want stress free game play play Animal Crossing.\r The whole sharing an island mechanic is not an issue for me, it actually works in my favor . Imagine my daughter and wife called me the whole time to come and help them with their own islands, will drive me crazy. Them sharing my already build island helps a lot.\r Not worth the full retail price but this being a Nintendo exclusive the price will never go down so might as well pay full price for it.","Es el mejor Animal crossing de la historia y muy probablemente ser\u00e1 juego del a\u00f1o. Es una belleza.","One of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had.  I love meeting new residents.  While I hate letting some go I know it means I get to meet new ones.  I love this game so much.","The menus and the interface, it's tiring after a while. It's really the black point, because the game is beautiful, fluid and really cool and addictive.","Muy entretenido y mejor\u00f3 mucho la entrega que jugu\u00e9 para ds,a\u00f1adieron muchas cosas nuevas y el compartir esta genial con amigos,hay algunas cosas que no me gustaron tanto como el control o la interfaz como dise\u00f1os de personajes pero por lo dem\u00e1s est\u00e1 muy bien","It\u2019s still amazingly good, but having to unlock basic features like the museum and the town hall just feels wrong. And while the crafting we very much welcome for furniture. For tools it feels limiting, and this series is not a game that you should feel limited in. Having to get island to a 3 star rating by doing stuff that you don\u2019t wanna do like planting flowers and building fences is also not really fun. I was expecting K.K. on the first Saturday and I was really excited for him but then I learned that I have to unlock him? This game is a Sim, why do I have to unlock basic features? It\u2019s an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone. But i personally think Stardew Valley and Rune Factory are way better games to just relax and simulate life.","Just a game for cry baby, only for kids under 6 Years old i cant undestand buying this baby gane","despu\u00e9s de probar el juego por poco mas de mes y medio pues me dio f\u00e1cilmente 130 horas de juego, lo cual me encanto pues es un juego donde puedes hacer de todo, aun no termino mi isla como yo la quiero al final pero es porque me faltan algunas recetas y pues el sistema de obtenci\u00f3n de recetas es lo que hace que sigas jugando por mucho tiempo, mas a parte el contenido nuevo que se va agregando al juego es gratis, realmente me encanto la mec\u00e1nica del juego","Me parece un juego muy tranquilizante y divertida, perfecto para desestresarse","Es un juego realmente adictivo, siempre hay algo que hacer.

The game does have it's flaws though, with stuff like the one island per console controversy, the Switch Online app isn't very good with it, no hourly music before you unlock the resident services building, etc which is why I can't really rate it higher than an 8","Eu acho que os jornalistas enaltecem demais os jogos da Nintendo, esse a\u00ed n\u00e3o tem nada de ''LEND\u00c1RIO'', Astral Chain \u00e9 muito melhor.

From what I know of the previous instalments I think the building of your own town on this island is the best evolution possible. I enjoy the nooks and crannies of my island including the literal Nook's Cranny store, in which it's exciting to see what new items I can afford for my house. It's got a good sense of humour and it exudes positive vibes.\r With the consensus that this is a fairly good game I must denote the sometimes baffling negatives:\r -You can't have one island per user, only one per console. The 0's piling up on this website only serve to show how broken Metacritic's user system is. However it is really stupid. I don't think it's intentionally greedy, or if it's a storage thing, I think Nintendo was just stupidly paranoid about \"cheating\" but I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would totally undermine the game if they had an island per user.\r-Menus and especially shopping menus, my god. They are not intuitive at all. I hate to compare it to another game but it doesn't have the quick interface of something like Minecraft. Also the lines of dialogue need to be way faster, I don't have all the time in the world to listen to Blathers.\r-Digging, picking up stuff and landscaping can be absurdly frustrating. Again it's slow and imprecise to  hit things with your shovel, and don't get me started on how many times I've picked up the wrong object, or haven't been able to place something because it wasn't clear, or shaped the wrong cliff or river. I know it's not meant to be a platformer or action-adventure but I think avatars would benefit from a much more robust moveset, and an interface that's a lot more precise and doesn't take its sweet time.\r With that out of the way, ACNH is fun, and I'm burnt out on it now but when the world gets closer to ending I'll come back to it and have a grand old time.",".....

This is a game review site and should not be a place for butt hurt fanboys to vent their incel frustrations.  Anyway I picked up the game as I never played an ac before and wanted to see what the fuss was. The game is colourful and charming and the animals are very adorable. I like how it's random with who will be moving into your island.  But I just dont get it you fish, hunt bugs look for fossils and that's kind of it. It's a slow pace chill game and I can see why some like it as an escape but it's not for me","This should have been selected has the Best Game of 2020 on the Game Awards.\r(user score on metacritic is so dumb, this is a masterpiece but this users keep bombing with negative reviews)","Animal Crossing: New Horizons ha sido posiblemente el juego m\u00e1s esperado de la saga.Sigue transmitiendo la sensaci\u00f3n de tranquilidad y calma que ya exist\u00eda en las anteriores entregas, las mec\u00e1nicas principales se han mantenido como el uso de las herramientas ya existentes y se ha llegado a aumentar con instrumentos de mano y las ya famosas escalera de mano y p\u00e9rtiga.Un punto a favor de este juego (que para otros ser\u00e1 en contra) es la dosificaci\u00f3n del contenido. Los viajantes en el tiempo seguramente sean los que han provocado esto, para no destripar todo el juego de un d\u00eda para otro como se demostr\u00f3 que pas\u00f3 en el 2\u00ba d\u00eda de juego.Este no es el juego m\u00e1s completo de la saga hasta el momento (yo considero que el m\u00e1s completo al d\u00eda que se escribe esta review es el New Leaf por la gran cantidad de edificios que hay y sus funciones), pero s\u00ed es el m\u00e1s ambicioso, debido a la promesa de actualizaciones durante al menos los dos siguientes a\u00f1os y la adici\u00f3n de nuevas mec\u00e1nicas nunca antes vistas en la saga.Dicho todo esto, tras m\u00e1s de 300 horas jugadas puedo concluir que: este es el juego que m\u00e1s he disfrutado y sigo disfrutando en mi vida, y llegando a ser perfecto para este confinamiento que en Espa\u00f1a llevamos viviendo desde justo una semana antes del lanzamiento del juego. El mejor juego para encerrarse en casa sin ninguna duda.","Really fun game, it sucks all of your time. Graphics and activities are fun to the point they start to feel like a chore. Also I don't really like not being able to actually use the items I get or craft. I can only get to see them.","This is a great game, it's super relaxing and fun to play. It's cool that you can craft items in this game. I don't get why people are complaing about how only the one person can do certain things on the island since most of the previous games were like this. In the 3DS only the one player was the mayor, so this wasn't really a surprise.","The game is fun but can be a bit boring if you are not skipping days (cheating) but it is very fun and addictive if you do skip days and complete missions. The bad side is that you need to log in every day (like most animal crossing games).\r Mostly recommended in the quarantine.","1st time player .You literally have to wait in real life time to play. There is about 20 minutes of to do lists every day. Lot of boredom .Very limited inventory which is ok in most games but this is harmful to your progress as some things you can\u2019t recieve twice.","Aunque el juego no es perfecto, realmente es algo muy disfrutable durante la cuarentena pero para quienes jugamos AC antes rapidamente sentimos cambios para mal como la limitacion de las islas por persona  realmente me parece excesiva, aun asi lo disfruto mucho pero el juego es muy disfrutable","Don't believe the hype and don't drink the Kool-aid. While this game is graphicallly beautiful and the Animal Crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new (and better) levels. Nintendo made decisions around multi-player and family sharing that make this game broken.\rFor me personally, the multiplayer shortcomings aren't too significant. I like walking around with my son and discovering new things and showing off our accomplishments. I am not a big online person so I have not tried that part of the game, but I do understand people's frustration at not being able to combine online and local multi-player to enhance the experience.\rI am more bothered by the way families (or Switch co-owners) are required to experience this game. The concept of needing a unique game and unique Switch to have separate islands is a blatant cash grab by Nintendo. This would not be an issue were the single island shared equally. There is, however, as system where the first person to create a character in the game becomes the \"island representative\", which means they are responsible for decisions such as where new houses will be built. The location of  buildings is not a huge problem as you can spend five minutes sitting together and agreeing on these things. What is a big deal is that secondary players are EXTREMELY limited in how they can contribute to these endeavors. Basically, you can send or give materials to the primary player, but this means that when a secondary player is enjoying the game, progress is halted unless they take out two controllers. My son wants to enjoy the game in a way that is characteristic of secondary player play style, but he is the primary player. This has led to a few arguments already as I ask him to focus on an island progression task but he just wants to collect bugs. This would be tolerable if you could switch the primary player or there was some alert that this might happen, but there is absolutely no in-game indication of the significance of being the primary player.\rBottom line, we are four days in and have made lots of progress, but we are thinking of starting over to save our family relationship. This game could have been amazing and allowed me to relax and have fun with my kid, but Nintendo broke it.\rAlso, no online backup. Seriously, Nintendo, I am losing my faith in you as a company.","It really pains me to give this game a low rating because honestly it does so many things right.  In truth, this game would definitely earn a 9 or 10 out of 10 were it not for one glaring issue.  The fact that the game limits you to one island per console.  This is bad for so many reasons that countless others have already pointed out. Obviously it means that multiple people are limited to sharing a single experience instead of being able to have their own separate adventures.  But that isn\u2019t really why I am so frustrated by this game.  No, actually my fianc\u00e9 and I were very excited to build our island life together and the idea of sharing this experience was something we were both super excited for.  The real problem is that WE DON\u2019T get to share the same experience together!  That\u2019s because in this game the only person who gets to enjoy the full game is the person that founds the island.   Everyone else is treated as a second class citizen unable to trigger any of the main progression events and relegated to doing only the more tedious chores the game has to offer.  So many of the missions and DIY recipes are locked away to these players.  I could go on about this forever but to keep things brief, this one flaw in game design has single handedly destroyed our desire to play this game that we were so excited to play.  The only half-viable solution seams to be buying another console (and probably another copy of the game).  Now given the recent collapse of society, switch consoles have become exceedingly hard to come by.  But even if that weren\u2019t the case, I still wouldn\u2019t be willing to buy another system because it feels like that was the entire reason the game was designed in this manner. This feels so scummy and is the worst part of this whole situation.  Really hope that the necessary changes get made but I expect they won\u2019t.  Until then my score stands.","This game has a lot of charm and it can be fun. But it is absolutely dull if you want to play local multi-player. The second and following players lack the same decision making as the first player. Also you can't have more than one island per console.When sharing a console in a household having to buy another console just to play one game is idiotic.","Bought this game for having a relaxing time. Unfortunately the game stress the heck out of you for the wrong reasons\r -No cloud save\r-Only one island per switch and only one normal player per switch.\r Kinda not relaxing when all my progress is in jeopardy and cant even have someone fully share the experience\r -No buyable baits\r-nearly impossible to catch special fishes\r-unneccessary unskippable dialogue for every little thing(yeah it's the 10000 fish i take or the 10000 bait i made, STOP WASTING MY TIME)\r Everything is geared upon making you waste time, turning an adorable and relaxing experience in a neverending and frustrating series of chores .\r I am sorry, i really would like to love this game. But to me it's obvious that more testing, more QoL measures and a more modern approach would have been way better and needed for the masterpiece we were really waiting for.\r And FFS it's a single palyer game, leave us play how we want!","Just as other reviewers are stating, good game, however, the multiplayer aspect/island limit makes it unplayable for me. SO started the game and due to lockdown has been progressing without me, so by the time I get back into the game I don't think I'll care to play. Very disappointed.","Some seriously questionable mechanics.  Like for example, in order to play online so your friends can visit your island, you have to enter the airport, sit through the same dialog text, tell the NPC at the counter to open your island for visitors, wait while the game saves and shows a 'Connecting to internet' screen for 10 secs.  Then the island will be open for visitors.\r The problem is, if you want to do practically anything in the game (send a letter, turn in the daily ghost quest, etc), you have to go back to that NPC, turn off online play (sitting through the same text and screens), just to do that action.  Then you have to travel back once you've done your thing, and re-enable the island.  It's just annoying, tedious, frustrating, and seemingly unnecessary - considering you're always online - case in point, friends can text you on your in-game phone... they just cannot visit you.  Super dumb.\r Now lets say you want to have multiple people in the house play the game, and each person wants their own playthrough - cannot happen.  The game will literally only let you have one playthrough per Switch, and everyone has to share the same island.  That means a family member can clean the whole island out (smash all the rocks, dig up all the fossils, etc), and when you decide to play later, the island is picked clean.  Not to mention someone can advance the story, and you miss it.  Seriously not cool.  We have 3 people in our family that play the Switch, and only 1 can play Animal Crossing.\r There are also gameplay mechanics that were badly implemented.  For example, if you want to sell items (which is the only real way to make money), you have two choices: walk up to the store mailbox and sell the items -or- enter the store, wait for the load screen, talk to the store keeper and go through his dialogue, sell your items, leave the store, watch the loading screen again.  The problem is you get 100% of the sell price of your items if you talk to the storekeep, but only like 60% of the price if you use the box on the outside of the store.  They explain the outside box as a way to sell items whenever the store is closed (they are open 9am to 10pm daily), but at the penalty of changing you a heavy fee.  I get why the outside-hours-box charges a fee (even if I think it's a stupid mechanic), but why are they charging me the fee when the store is still open?  Why must I sit through two loading screens and a dialogue tree just to vend my items at full price?\r It's mechanics like this that really suck the fun out of the game, and turn it into a downright chore.  The novelty of the cute load screens, or crafting animations, or lengthy repetitive dialogue really gets in the way of fun.  Also it loses 4 points outright for the dumb single island mechanic.  Bad job, Nintendo.","My son and daughter have always lovedAnimal Crossing. They were thrilled that New Horizons was coming out and that we could all play together. The game is great for 1 player. The graphics and play ability is awesome. It stinks for multi player. As the second or third player you can\u2019t really do anything but walk behind player one. You have no value and don\u2019t add to the gameplay. I would love to see a split screen option or where each player can have the same gameplay as the creator of the island.","As a diehard fan of the series, who's sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all, and who STILL plays the GameCube version almost daily since 2002, I'm really disappointed with this one.\r I'm going to give objective reasons, followed by my subjective opinions afterward. So let's just get right into it...\r 1) One town per Switch? Why? GameCube let you have a town per memory card, and that was almost 20 years ago. Also, why is whoever founds the town, the one who can make the progress in the game?\r 2) Dialogue. It's common agreement in the fanbase that, every AC game after the original has gotten worse with villager dialogue, with New Horizons, it's really hit rock bottom. One liners seem to be the most common response when talking to villagers; Yesterday, one of mine said \"Today was fun!\" four times in a row. Are you actually serious, Nintendo?\r 3) Furniture. Where in the world are the themed furniture sets? The different series? The Animal Crossing games' lifeblood is its unique and themed furniture. Yes, I'm aware there are a few out there - Rattan, Imperial, Cute - I may be missing one or two others, but I don't think so, at least not that I'm aware of so far. And seasonal/holiday sets don't count, because they're exclusive to those holidays and events. I'm talking about run-of-the-mill sets you could always hope to find at Nook's, or receive from villagers, and so on. Where's the Modern series? Classic? Cabana? Lovely? Exotic? Why am I seeing, for the most part, the same, or identical pieces of furniture rotated in my (upgraded) Nook's Cranny? It's all the same generic, non-themed pieces with slight color variations - and this also applies to flooring and wallpaper, which seemed to be as generic as they possibly could be. Are sets being added in later? If so, why? Why couldn't they be included as part of the base game?\r 4) House expansion. There's so much extensive customization in mostly all other aspects of New Horizons, yet we have to upgrade our house in a rigid, set-in-stone order. Why? I just wanted to have the expanded central room, with the 2nd floor and maybe basement later on. Such was my surprise when I found out that I HAVE to add a back room, then I have to pay it off and then I HAVE to add the left room, then add the right room, THEN I could have the second floor. Why, Nintendo? In New Leaf, we were given the option as to how we wanted to expand, and the second story was the first upgrade after expanding your main room. I don't want side rooms, why can't I upgrade my house how I want like in the other games? I NEED to know why you've deliberately removed this.\r **Subjective gripes\r 1) Very few patterns/shirts from the other games, which have always been staples. We're still early into the year and gameplay, so I'm sure they change with the seasons, but so far I've only seen the Misty Shirt and Frog Shirt, as far as staple clothing.\r 2) Totakeke songs shouldn't be buyable from the terminal in the town hall, because it negates any real reason to listen to K.K. play songs and get the airchecks from him, since you can just buy 7 different songs in a week. More, if you're a time traveler.\r 3) Where are the gyroids? Another staple of the Animal Crossing series, completely absent, save for Lloid, and he's not furniture so he doesn't count.\r 4) Art exhibit in the museum - why is it not in the game? Art has been a collectible item in every AC game, yet not only can we not donate them to the museum (the exhibit doesn't exist), but we art pieces aren't even in the game. Not even paintings. Why? I'm sure they're going to be in some DLC down the road, but why weren't they included in the base game?\r I'm gonna leave it at this, despite probably being able to think of a few more subjective points. In conclusion, this game is fun, it's very customizable for the most part, and there's lots of interesting things to do, but as an Animal Crossing game, it doesn't hold up. There was more to do, collect, buy, etc. 20 years ago in the first game, than in New Horizons.\rNintendo (and I'm not afraid to say this) half-assed this game. It feels rushed and very incomplete, despite the fact that New Leaf came out 7 years ago, wherein they had all that time to really make the most amazing Animal Crossing experience ever. They dropped the ball, and as a passionate lover of this series, I'm extremely disappointed, and it makes me really sad to have to say that, not even two weeks after it came out.","It\u2019s a one player game, for the most part, so deal with it. For what it is, it\u2019s an amazing game. You don\u2019t need to gripe about the multiplayer. While it is a bad feature, the game is still incredibly beautiful and fun to play.","Great gameplay. Looks beautiful, and I love the calming nature of the game. However there are a few things that really bother me playing. One part are the birdcages, and this is because I know kids play this game. They are so small the birds can\u2019t move, and while they aren\u2019t real I know this isn\u2019t uncommon in real life. I don\u2019t like to be nit-picky but I would like if they could make an updated size, so people don\u2019t normalize that sort of treatment. I think the same should apply to goldfish and betta fish, very common pets among young children, which is the target audience of the game. These fish are more often than not kept in the same conditions portrayed , and I believe while it is a game, they should still make an example for kids.","Overall, I think this is a decent title and I would have rated it higher except for the problems with multiple accounts playing on a single switch.  The primary user (my wife in my case) can get certain objectives but I can help by gathering the resources she needs to complete them quickly.  Other that that, I haven't run into any real negatives in playing (although I find the new \"Bunny\" stuff rather annoying).  Overall I've had fun playing together as well as individually.","There's a few issues I have with this game. The lack of online interactive related things and unnecessary long transitions when people leave your island, the fact that there's only a \"Real time\" option, and that there's no way in game to advertise your island. I'd love a brochure to \"sell\" your island, tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it off maybe and saying stuff like \"Hey, I have a tarantula island, come on by!\" Create more of a city, involve more on your island. I just feel it's so limited for not really a good reason but to be a cop out. I'd love more interaction with the citizens and events with them. Everything seems so bare bones for a $60 game.\r I'd also enjoy it if you had sort've a function to treat it like stardew valley where it had it's own hastened day/night cycle to an extent. I'd like to at least play the game in a few weeks, enjoy all there is to see  and catch/do quests for everyone in that time frame. It's just not there, just nooks increasing debt with everything you do. I get that \"animal crossing may just not be for me\" however, I don't think a lot of what I said are bad idea's nor would make people dislike the game any.  Do people really enjoy the game mostly being played only an hour or so at a time and all these things that you probably wont ever get done because you may not be playing in the September time frame to catch certain things?\r The last thing is the most obvious though. Not sharing your island. Me and my gf share the switch because I barely play Nintendo games and so she somewhat does, so very little reason to own two. People telling others \"Why not just own 2 switches! stop being poor!\" why should we be punished for their poor design choice? Such a weird thing to defend a company on.","No se pueden crear dos islas en la misma consola. Por el resto aunque aveces algunas mec\u00e1nicas son algo tediosas no es nada preocupante excepto lo de que te puedan dar recetas repetidas eso es horrible porque te puedes tirar much\u00edsimo tiempo y no tener una mesita de noche como me ha pasado a m\u00ed por ejemplo.","Im addicted to this game however i have some major issues. First is the one island per console isnt a wise move. Second there's literally zero new content after you renovate the store ONCE NPCS are nonexistent besides villagers blathers the nooks and isabelle ( i don't count the dodos **** those guys ) like how can you have a 2020 release game have less content than the 3ds game that came out in 2012... wheres brewster wheres gracie wheres resetti?? And that rescue app doesn't count. This game is overall extremely disappointing it pretty much boils down to a happy home designer spinoff disguised as a triple a title. Im beginning to thing that they made the beginning slow on purpose to pad out the game a little bit. I can't believe this is the game we've been waiting for i hope they update it soon or come out with an expansion pack or dlc because i feel ripped off and i got this as a gift. Smh Nintendo you didnt ruin animal crossing but you definitely watered it down 2/5 compared to the other games i dont want to give it a one or a zero because the game is stunning to look at but besides that its a shadow of its former self still fun to play but i got way more enjoyment out of new leaf i still haven't unlocked everything in that game and ive been time traveling like crazy in that game. For at least a year on and off but i've pretty much unlocked everything in less than two weeks in this one... its comparable to mgsv ground zeroes and thats not a compliment","There are lots of features taken out of this game from previous games. Seems like Nintendo really just threw this game together. It\u2019s becoming more and more disappointing every day. Previous titles have way more content.","As expected the game is brilliantly fun and relaxing, I haven't skipped a day playing it since it came out and I don't see myself doing so in the future, however does that mean the game is actually any good? Well the short answer is no. The reason I come back every day is because you have to, if you want to choose which villagers you have in your town you have to come back every day and hope someone is staying at the campsite as it's near impossible to find them on islands. if you want to fill your house with furniture you actually like you're basically just hoping to get something good in the store every day. If you want something to do you have to hope there's an NPC in the village that day. It's been less than a month since it came out and I'm already just logging on, checking my shops, getting my message in a bottle, collecting my nook miles, and leaving as that's really all there is to do. I cannot decorate my town or my house any more as I've got no more furniture that would look good. I can't get new villagers because they barely show up on islands, I can't progress with the story as the amount of stars your village has depends only on having more villagers (my friend regularly tells me he wishes his island looked like mine, but he has three stars because he has 10 villagers whereas I have one because I have six villagers), I cannot try to grind bells as nearly everything ends up being an egg during this event. There really is absolutely nothing to do. then there's the huge cutscene that means it can take nearly two minutes just to go to someone else's island and every time someone comes to your island you have to stop what you're doing and wait for the stupidly long cutscene, Not to mention the fact you cannot play on two accounts unless you want to share an Island which puts you at a huge disadvantage. Overall just not a well thought-out and designed game.","\u041b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c!)\u041d\u0443 \u0441 \u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c ,\u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f, \u043f\u043e \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e!!","The game is limiting on how to get Five stars on your island, it has a set way of calculating how your island is rated but it clashes with themes and styles of building ones island. It grades based on the amount of items in the Island, meaning you can just literally fill the island with random items anywhere and get five stars but the island doesn\u2019t look how you\u2019d like it. For example, I was told by Isabelle that I have too many trees and it was problem for my ratings but my islands theme is overgrown... it worked beautifully in new leaf","A great Animal Crossing game.  Keeping the core mechanics with some added features.  Aninal Crossing has been a part of my childhood for so long.  One complaint I do have is the extremely lackluster music.  It's like they said \"Hey, this title music sounds cool.  What can we make with this theme?\"  I really wish they put more effort into music design, otherwise a really great staple Aninal Crossing game.","The game itself is great, but restricting households to one island per console is terrible and ruins the entire experience.","I\u2019m not happy with the implementation of multiplayer in this game. I bought the game for my wife and she was excited to have her own island to explore. Come to find out, when my boys created their characters they could only go to my wife\u2019s island. So there can only be one island per Nintendo switch, regardless of who is logged into the game under their own profile. So unless I buy multiple switches and multiple copies of the game we can\u2019t experience our own island..... what the actual heck is that? That has got to be the laziest game development I\u2019ve ever seen. How did the developers think it would be ok to force one island per switch???!?! This game is a huge disappointment. They really should patch the game and fix the abysmal multiplayer. I never would have downloaded the game if I had known the ridiculous decision they made. I have never played a game that had this glaring of an issue, meanwhile critics are rating it very high. Look at the user score... critics are completely out of touch with what people want in a game.

It is either a terrible design choice or intended to force parents to purchase additional consoles and copies, either way it is not acceptable and the issues it would cause in households should have been foreseen. If you're buying this for yourself or have an only child the game is great, otherwise it is one to avoid; as unfortunate as this is.","Great game, obviously. What ruining it to me is limiting one island per console. It\u2019s such a low move. It\u2019s money grabbing to me and it ruins the experience for families with one console. It\u2019s sad that people are being forced to buy another Nintendo console to experience the game fully.","We gave this game to my sons on Easter. My younger son loves this game. My older son who has to play on his younger brothers island got mad and left the room very upset. Thank you for the one island limit Nintendo and animal crossing. You ruined Easter","P\u00e9simo, simplemente una burla a quienes amamos esta hermosa saga, porque nintendo? Porque?.","The truth is that if I would want to play this game alone, my rate will be a lot better. I\u00b4m playing with my girlfriend, she is \"the main citizen\", and I can't help with anything! I don't have the main DIY recipes, I can't help in the main decisions and my experience is pretty limited. I don't have problems with the one island limitation but it feels like the co-op game experience is incomplete.\rAnd finally, why is it necessary to change the switch tools button when you are the second player? and why can't I pick items and store them in my inventory? That makes no sense to me.\rPlease Nintendo, fix the co-op experience !!!!","bought the special edition switch and the 60$ game to share with my brother, only to find out that we can't create different islands and that the second player can barely do anything, disappointing to say the least, i really can't believe that nintendo would do something like this, im 100% sure that A LOT of families are experiencing the same thing, something so easy to fix as just giving the option to have different island per user, seriously disappointed with you nintendo.DO NOT BUY THIS if you share the switch with someone and this person wants to play the game.","I particularly enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of this game. It's truly unique. You do things in your own time, at your own pace. Animal Crossing is also a neat reminder that everything takes time, in a day and age where we've grown to be accustomed to unrealistic speed and high expectations.\r I've been playing for a couple months now, and I'm enjoying it a lot. Bounding with the villagers is really cool, customising your island and character and seeing how the flowers bloom, bridges are built and seasons pass is more entertaining than I thought it would be.\r The downsides I'd say are how you can never choose quantity of items, you always have to buy and sell one by one (notable exception of flowers and shrubs, which you can buy in bulks). Also having to first craft a flimsy tool to only then be able to craft the normal one (crafting the tool directly would have been appreciated).","The game is fun, the gameplay is addicting, this low score is based on the fact that if you try to play with multiple profiles, you will only have one island. This means that one person might start the island and have it be theirs and someone else would just be a resident, unable to play the game the way it was meant to be. Resources are limited, leading to whoever plays first every day getting everything and the second being left with nothing. Even buying a separate game cartridge won\u2019t solve the problem. It\u2019s a cheap way to sell switches, and proves Nintendo is losing its dedication to customers and families. 1 Star","I like having to play on one island, but not being able to have the second player make big choices or get the cool recipes that player 1 does is infuriating.","Quality game if you have one user in your household who would like to play this game. Fairly pointless game for any other users in your household.","The first person to play is the resident representative and is the only player that really matters. Because my wife and I let my 4 year old son play first because he was so excited now we are at his whim or have to reset the game. Ridiculous and shameful of Nintendo to think.this is acceptable. GIVE US THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE REPRESENTATIVE. Will be telling my friends to not buy this game until Nintendo fixes their game.","Fianc\u00e9 loves the game, but got it for both of us to play, except we have COMPLETELY different play styles and ways we like to be creative, she has played it since it came out, i get on and i can only play on her island? Why?I cant contribute to her full museum or make major changes to how the island is laid out because she made her game first? Whats the point in even playing this game if you dont play alone? What does nintendo expect me to do? Buy another switch and another copy of this game? Its crap. And essentialy just makes this game unplayable.fix this nintendo its not hard","I have mixed opinions on this game, which I will list below:\r Positive:\r+ Addition of crafting and Nook Miles makes it more game-like, and have more incentive to play\r+ Customization of furniture, and being able to place items outside increases creativity\r+ Some Quality of life improvements, like not being stopped by store-keepers when entering and leaving\r+Animals have more animations, cute.\r+ Terraforming is a neat addition\r Negatives\r- Terraforming controls are finnicky and overly-time consuming to use\r- No way to craft in batches\r- Animals repeat themselves constantly\r- Online is terrible with dodo codes. Load times everywhere, constant errors\r- Lack of furniture sets\r- Less stores, upgrades, and main characters than in past titles\r- One Island per Switch\r- Player 2 is a glorified NPC, unable to do anything while you are the leader\r- Game repeats same song for first week, become grating fast\r- Loading in-between museum rooms is grating, same with in houses\r All in all, it is an entertaining time-waster, but this is NOT a 10/10 game. Cute, yes, but it has a wide array of issues and quality-of-life problems that alone knock it down points. After a few weeks of playing without fast-forwarding the clock, the game has become stale with little remaining depth to offer.","Like the game's single player play through, but the decision to limit it to one island per console, was the the dumbest thing I've seen.  I have 4 kids who want to play it, but no one but the one who played first is actually in charge of anything, everyone else is second class stuck on their island.  And with the island being as small as it is,, even if they weren't second class, it makes everything cramped and horrible.  Bad job, needs an update to change to one island per account.","Only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff. The other players on the island can\u2019t contribute and can only really gather resources. This limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows. I hope Nintendo fixes this.","Locking the save data to once switch, limiting a household to one island so only one person can have a full experience? I see broken homes as siblings and souses alike fight over island layouts. This is such a clear money grab.Shame on you, Nintendo.","Was loving the game up until I finally realized that as one of the secondary players (wife was first one to play game), I was locked out of basic recipes and objectives because she had not yet completed them.  This is the worst multiplayer design I've ever seen,  as basically only one person can help further the island, the rest of us are just \"there\".  Until this gets fixed I've got no desire to play again.","FAMILY UNFRIENDLY - Nintendo have decided to try and gouge families. its crazy that a game so suited to play by young kids is locked down to just one island per console. I can't justify multiple purchases for my kids, so only one of them can use NH (because she was promised it as a reward) while the others can't play. If she hadn't been promised the game, I wouldn't have bought it on priniciple - this is just user hostile. Given the colossal difference in value between X-box game pass and the cost of all the Nintendo exclusives on the switch, this will be the last but one Nintendo game I buy (if I don't by the next Zelda game, my family will kick me out).","Extremely disappointing game. I bought this thinking it would be a great couch co-op for my girlfriend and myself to play together after seeing the initial reviews of the game. It is not a great couch co-op game, the couch co-op feels like in fact it has intentionally been made to be a bad experience. Not only is the couch co-op bad but the game is effectively only good for 1 account per switch. They have made it so whoever creates the island in the game the first time creates the only island you can make for your switch. Okay so you have to share an island, thats not bad it was for couch co-op anyways. Then after starting to play you realize that the first player is the \"resident representative\" so basically they get the full game experience. Every other play: does not get to create their own island, can not place and buildings, terraform or do anything of any importance to the island they are forced to play on, they do not get key recipes they will need to make basic furniture for their house that the first player gets, they cannot advance the story past what the first player advances the story to. Again, this game design has clearly been made to sell customers on more consoles, it feels very deliberately restrictive to all players but the first. It has intentionally made couch co-op a disappointing, shallow experience. I would not recommend you spend your money on this. Spend 15$ on startdew valley and get a game with 10x more content and functionality.","C'est des d\u00e9biles chez Nintendo !!!!\rPutain ils sont je sais pas combien dans leur Pays de merde et ils sont pas foutu d'ajouter la possibilit\u00e9 d'avoir chacun sont \u00eele !

This is worse than EA and Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I have three kids and we share a Switch.  I'm not going to buy two more Switches just so everyone can have their own island.  The fact that only the first person to log into the game gets to decide everything and have the only island is absolutely infuriating. I wish I had known this before buying, because I would have never bought this game. Shame on you Nintendo.","I bought this family game for my two kids and now I realize that one of them will not be able to enjoy it because there is a limit of only one Island per switch?!? That's so incredibly impossible to understand.... Shame on you greedy Nintendo!","It's rather unfortunate to see all of the negative reviews for what should be considered such a great game. Animal Crossing New Horizons is such a fresh take on the series and offers so much more to players than previous entries. It has great online play and the visuals just feel extremely nice,  although a bit more of the gridlocked side. Villagers are all super friendly, albeit, a bit boring with their repetitive dialogue types. The small attempt of a story or some sort of plot is welcoming and very unobtrusive to the main aspects of the game. Not to mention, the Nook Miles program gives such a great incentive to keep playing the game, and just using every feature the game has to offer.\r Some things noticeably offputting- which does have a load of the fanbase lowering their reviews- is these things listed:\r -While you can speed through crafting animations, you can't essentially just skip the entire animation.\r-You can't craft multiples of things all at once, therefore having to go through tedious crafting sessions.\r-As mentioned before, dialogue with villagers still remains seriously repetitive, including main npc characters (Nook, Isabelle, etc...)\r-Local multiplayer is tedious, especially doing the follow the leader with other players. It's terrible and not incredibly fun.\r-The game being locked to one island per console is relying on a relic system from the past which should've been obsolete by now. Furthermore, players who aren't the leader of the island cannot progress through the story until the leader player does. For a game that advertises multi-user friendliness, this drawback really drains out that aspect.\r Although these are some unfortunate drawbacks overall, the game is still super good and has lots of growth potential. Hopefully, Nintendos AC dev team will listen to the complaints users have,  and fix some of these things.","This is a hard one to score, Two different scores for time travelling and non.\r 5/10 non\r8/10 TT\r Usually this would be the other way around right? because if you don't skip days then you have more to do over time. At the same time correct and incorrect. This is from a time travellers perspective though.\r For time travellers they are able to skip to any day of the year and be able to catch fish/bugs that are meant for that time of year. Games come out so frequently nowadays that you could end up forgetting you even have Animal crossing to play when another game comes out that your absorbed into. So being a time traveller you can put so much time into the game so quickly and be able to get as much possible from it without having to do so much waiting. I Time travelled and i sunk in an easy 100 hours doing stuff and enjoyed most of it. From doing all this i found some stuff that could affect a casual non TT playthrough.\r The waiting days has been in since the begining but in this game its next level, theres alot more you have to wait days to do. Which means alot less of being able to play while waiting for these. Everything is IRL time based, so its not even like you can spend time trying to finish your collections because you have to wait for that during times of the year. So combining it all it just makes less to do rather than more. Its more over time, this game is perfect for you if you can only sink in a couple hours a day. Its really not even hard to get money in this, so you can do everything you need to do in a couple hours each day. Theres no more burrying your shovel to get golden either with this new recipe thing, so you now have to do something that comes randomly each week and you have to do it 30 times. Which is another you having to wait day by day to check if that persons there. The amount of waiting you have to do has been increased by around double, which imo isnt a good thing as like i said games come out alot and you can just end up forgetting about your island. I never felt like this in the past couple of games and they still had all this in, just less of it.\r The local multiplayer really needs some work for the next game, should be two completely different save files and only join each others island if your both logged in at the same time and P1's island is the one you go to. I don't really local multiplayer though so this doesn't really affect me as much.\r All that really comes down to this is there is just alot more waiting in this one and for someone that wants to spend 10 hours on this with a day off work. You are going to get bored as the game is constantly at a dead end. Someone that can only fit in a couple hours a day this is perfect for you.","This is unacceptable. I cannot believe my entire family need to share an island this game is not at all worth the price tag on it. I want a refund. The only way to have an individual experience with the game is to buy another console with another cartridge. This is a disgusting marketing idea and a completely terrible game design. I wish I could give a negative for my score it\u2019s a greedy money grab that I thought Nintendo was better than. Guess I was wrong","it's a very simple game with simple mechanism but still, you can be creative and flexible in creating basically everything according to your taste. the only complain i had is that the nook's cranny shouldn't have closing time @10pm, bc realistically speaking, not everyone has the time to play the game let's say, at daytime.","The multiplayer of AC-NH and the events (until eastern) are trash, but the game is very nice and with a lot of love for detai, its the perfect game for come down and relax.","the dialogue can be a bit repetitive but overall this is a great game to play, I am the only player on my switch so not being able to have multiple islands is not a problem for me. visiting other island via internet is very seamless in my experience, definitely a good upgrade from new leaf and previous versions out there.","*WARNING: I do not own the Nintendo Switch Player Pak, nor the \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" Game Pak, my review will be based on what I heard from other people*\r.\r This game looks amazing, it's smooth unlike any other Animal Crossing game, its new features are some that fans have been waiting for years. From what I've seen and heard, it's addicting as every Animal Crossing game and, with every information I gathered about this game... I gotta say, you NEED to buy it.","Entendo que a limita\u00e7\u00e3o de uma ilha por console \u00e9 bastante infeliz e afete a maneira como fam\u00edlias com diversos usu\u00e1rios interagem com o game, mas isso nem de longe \u00e9 motivo razo\u00e1vel para a chuva de zeros aqui nos reviews.

The one villager representative is a downside along with the free for all time travelling, but it's how each one plays the game.\rLike in mmorpgs, put your life aside and then get to make your island with your face!","I want to start off saying this game is great and I'm enjoying it but I will say it's a bit more stressful than the DS version because there's a lot of running around and collecting but I'd say that's just apart of the game. The only thing I want changed as soon as possible is the only one island feature. I have a younger brother and he is on my island because he wants to play but cant make decisions or do really anything because its my island and I want to create it so he's only allowed to gather things which saddens both of us and on top of that he has the possibility of ruining things and he takes many resources I need. PLEASE ADD ANOTHER ISLAND FEATURE. Also the follower and leader same device multiplayer thing Is super annoying. At least make it so there's multiple islands... otherwise it's fun.","I\u2019ve enjoyed my time with new horizons a ton I loved how they improved on customization and things of the sort but there\u2019s many sore thumbs that stick out to me being a long time fan, one is how any other accounts on the switch are forced to share a island now this isn\u2019t a big problem for me as I\u2019m the only one who plays but it is a big problem in terms of progressing as you can\u2019t help out to expand the island, only the first person can causing a lot of hassle, so the rating loses a point from that, then secondly it feels like most of the loved furniture sets aren\u2019t even in the game and with that it feels empty along with multiple npcs missing it just makes me feel like a this game was rushed even though in reality it was worked on for a long time, it feels bad to be harsh like this but there\u2019s just a couple of big negatives that pushed the score down for me","One island per console? Yes, please! For the past 3 games this is the way it's been. Gamecube was the one where you could have multiple and that required multiple memory cards. Yet I don't see people review bombing those. Those were better games too.","Update: After playing it for awhile I have had a change of heart. I still believe each cartridge should allow multiple island but I\u2019ve been having lots of fun sharing the island with other users.\r Wow Nintendo! This is a very Greedy  move on your end to ONLY have ONE island per user and console! I bought this game to play with my wife only to find out you could only have ONE island. This is NOT OKAY! You used to care about your fans and customers but now I\u2019m falling out of love with Nintendo. I\u2019m not sure if I would ever buy another game because $60 is a lot of money to pay.","Alright. Honestly speaking, this game is a good 7-8/10. The core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game. Little improvements to the game, like actually having the option to move your home / being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome. The number of villagers possible to meet (and invite) is astounding! While not every villager makes a comeback in the game, but a number of characters last seen in the original Animal Crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games.\r I do find fault with the one island per console thing, but... I think that has been overly addressed to the point where  My main issue with the game is the UI / Camera Layout.\r Listen, I'm fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house. It really isn't needed. What is needed, however, is the ability to look top-down. Way too many times have I missed a glowing spot because they're hidden behind a building or something. It's great that you've included it with the end-of-game mechanic, which isn't to be named for spoiler warnings, but I think it should become part of the core game mechanic.\r The DIY crafting menu sucks, and so does the inventory menu. Let's say you're trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells. Sure, you can mash A to speed up the crafting process, but what if you don't want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing? Gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo, or something. I'd much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once. Speaking of \"multiple items at once\", it also wouldn't hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory. You need to select the item, and select \"grab one\" in order to move separate something from a stack, but only at one at a time. It'd be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time. Also worth mentioning, but I don't think the game's worth $60. I don't have a reasoning behind this, but... I think $50 might be a more appropriate price.\r With all of that said, I'm not dropping the game. I love it and will keep playing it. It sucks that my little sister can't play the game too, but since I am playing this single-player... I'm fine with this. Hopefully, they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future.\r TL;DR:\r Pros:\r- \"Similar\" enough to older games\r- Able to finally move your home.\r- So many villagers to meet, some returning for the first time in a while!\r Mixed:\r- Crafting is cool but kinda tedious.\r Cons:\r- Camera angels are kinda annoying to hold.\r- ONE PROFILE PER CONSOLE.\r- Controversial opinion, but I don't think it's worth $60.\r Verdict: Honestly a 7.5/10, but I'll give it an 8.","AMAZING! Probably one of the best Animal Crossing since it was launched for the first time on the GameCube! You have a lot of liberty in this game: you can pretty much do whatever you want.

Horrible buy Xenoblade DE instead","New Horizons is a a great addition to the animal crossing series.....However\r So i picked up New Horizons as my first game after buying a switch during lock down, i saw it as a relaxing game to kill a lot of hours to get through the current pandemic, and i want to start by saying that it did exactly that, from the moment i booted the game up i was instantly hooked on the idea of building my island from the ground up and creating the environment i want, from carefully placing items to create cute little Cafes to acquiring my favorite villagers, Animal Crossing seemed to have it all, and after 2 weeks and 175 hours of game play later i was still discovering new items and new little quirks that kept the game compelling and intriguing.\r Now however, as great as i just stated the game was, and let me reiterate still is, there are still issues with the game, for a start, Terra forming and overall island customization, i'm honestly surprised this hasn't been touched upon by other reviewers but i personally felt this side of the game incredibly frustrating and lacking in creative freedom, i lost count on the amount of times i went to place down a tree, in plenty of room, only to be told by the game that \"There isn't enough room\" on far too many occasions ideas for island designs where ruined by the games little leg room when it comes to item placing, Now. let me get onto Terra forming, now i'm willing to give the game some leniency in this department, partially because its a rare feature to find implemented in any Nintendo game period, never mind an Animal Crossing game, and while the feature is overwhelmingly well received and massive for giving the players a sense of customization and the ability to really make their island their own....its incredibly clunky, like to the point i almost don't want to use it, i don't know i feel like a lot of Animal Crossings customization features in this game are very limiting, while at the same time giving players the freedom to still do almost anything they desire, its a strange middle ground and one that while frustrating at times, i suppose i still managed to look past when you realize how simplistically charming the rest of the game is.\r In conclusion, is Animal Crossing a great game? Yes definitely, is it perfect? No, however with its charming art style, addictive game play, and ability to edit your island to your desire, is it a game that is guaranteed to keep you hooked and checking in every day? definitely","Un juego de 10, la verdad lo que es para mi esposa y para mi ha sido un juego de liberaci\u00f3n dentro de este encierro de la cuarentena del Covid19, ademas de que siento que el juego permite compartir ideas y proyectos con tu persona especial.","This game more than lived up to my expectations. Some people are complaining about the one island per console limit and that is valid. At the end of the day, this doesn't affect me as I see the Switch as more of a personal console than a family (shared) console so I personally am fine with this limitation. But on the other hand, save file limitations have been part of the franchise since its inception. You've never been able to store multiple save files (on one medium) for any Animal Crossing game. I'm sure this is meant to encourage sharing a single town for a more genuine and social experience, but some players don't like to be told how to play and I get it.\rAlmost every aspect of the game is beautiful and amazing. Though, the background music for the island is a bit monotonous and lacks the variety of previous titles. In all past titles, there were always one or more background songs that I genuinely loved but none from this one have really sung to me. Another problem I have with this game is that arranging stacked furniture outside in a particular orientation is cumbersome and sometimes outright impossible. Another final complaint, and I could be wrong here, but it seems like the non-event-specific DIY recipes are granted in a purely random fashion where a weighted random algorithm would likely be more fair and enjoyable to players.","simplemente, buenardo.Es que, como explicar la tranquilidad que transmite el juego.

It's my first animal crossing game, and I love it so much. The 1 island per switch thing is ridiculous though. Not even 1 island per game cartridge. 1 island per switch. Do you want another island? 300 dollars for that.","Been playing this game since launch and was really excited for this game beforehand, at first I was in love with the game and just happy to play a new animal crossing game on switch, I loved the fact we started off with basically nothing and had to work with Tom nook to build up our island, but after completing the little story mode in nook and having played the game for a while it\u2019s not all I thought it would be. First I do love the fact that we have a lot more ways when customising our island such as getting to place and move villager houses, shops and museum and even our own house and the new terraforming tool is great, also really like the idea of crafting our own items and furniture feels like it gives me more things to do in the game itself and helps me when wanting more furniture/ items when doing my island up. Also love getting to go to the NMT islands to find villagers instead of getting a random villager moving in when one moves out. There is also a lot more seasonal events in the game which gives the player a lot more to do in game. Graphics have obviously improved and I actually like the new music in the game, and there is a lot more with character customisation. I feel like they have gone all out with the customisation in the game which I love as I can really be creative with my island But I feel like a have more negatives than positives which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game. The game has improved in many ways but in others it just lacks a lot, firstly I feel like a lot of the personalities of the villagers just feel the same and they say the same things quite a lot and as soon as you speak to them once they kind of get sick of you if you try again, there is only 2 shops in the game (able sister and nooks cranny) and evening though these shops are good, I feel like we need more shops in the game and the shops we have could me improved so much more, for instance in able sisters when going into the changing room you can only buy a set of clothing and then need to come out and then back into the changing room and rinse and repeat if you want to buy multiple sets, it gets quite annoying after a while, also nooks cranny is lacking I feel like a get a lot of repeat furniture and the shop itself only has one upgrade with is a downgrade from previous games, this game does offer crafting so we can make most stuff ourselves but there\u2019s a lot of furniture you have to buy and also I loved upgrading the shop multiple times as I became a goal for me. The game is either missing previous NPC\u2019s or they are again lacking such as Leif and kicks only showing up every now and again only with a stall with a select amount of items and then the likes of rooster and his shop and a bunch of the ACNL Main Street shops missing with there NPC\u2019s missing. The Nook mile tickets are w good idea but the items you can buy or always the same apart from the fence diys as they change daily, and I feel a lot of the NMT Islands become very similar after a while and don\u2019t really offer anything unless your looking for a villager or a specific rare island but even then I feel like they should offer more, also more of a minor issue but I think we should have more custom design slots, we do have more than what we had in ACNL but still we should have a lot more, I feel like I see so many amazing custom designs online but I can\u2019t use them as I have filled all my slots which custom designs that I am currently using on my islandAlso there is another 2 main issues I have with the game first being that there can only be one island per switch so if you share a switch with someone and you both want to play the game you have to play on the same island and only one player can do most of the stuff such as starting the island up when you create it, feel like this is such a step back considering the switch itself feels like its advertised as a family sharing console, also don\u2019t like the fact that there is no cloud saves so if you make an island on one switch you can only play it on that switch, I think they are trying to make a way round this but still annoyingI think a good thing about this game is that the devs are frequently updating the game and adding stuff in to the game bit by bit so a lot of the issues I have could be added in through an update which is good but that\u2019s if they choose to add this stuff into the game and also I feel like some of my issues and things missing from the game shouldn\u2019t of been added through updates they should of been apart of base game Overall I am still enjoying this game a lot but it could be so much more.","Animal Crossing es una experiencia incre\u00edble que crece d\u00eda a d\u00eda. Nunca antes hab\u00eda jugado algo de la saga y ten\u00eda mis dudas porque no sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo un jueguito as\u00ed me podr\u00eda divertir: no tiene metas reales sino las que te propongas t\u00fa qu\u00e9 b\u00e1sicamente es hacer tu isla y tu casa bonita. Pues resulta que es m\u00e1gico, es un juego hermoso que te enamora cada d\u00eda. Llevo m\u00e1s de 210 horas jugadas y sigo queriendo m\u00e1s. Cada actualizaci\u00f3n le da mas vida al juego y siempre hay cosas qu\u00e9 hacer, a pesar que ya hayas alcanzado las famosas 5 estrellas.Los residentes de la isla son mis amigos y, de un tiempo ac\u00e1, decidimos que \u00edbamos a dejarlos ir cuando se quisieran ir, y es doloroso porque los voy a extra\u00f1ar. El mundo que hay fuera que hacen los que juegan este juego es maravilloso y es que te contagia la buena vibra de alguna forma. Quieres ayudar a todos, ser amigos, conocer islas.El apartado t\u00e9cnico est\u00e1 muy bien: los gr\u00e1ficos son s\u00faper bonitos, la m\u00fasica es un espect\u00e1culo, un gran 10, la jugabilidad est\u00e1 bien, adecuada para lo que se requiere. Luego est\u00e1 la lentitud del juego, pero creo que es parte de la experiencia.El juego no es perfecto. Tiene errores muy puntuales  que los corregir\u00edan con tan poco, pero creo que no quieren corregirlo: 1ro: una sola isla para todos. Vamos que esto deber\u00eda ser una opci\u00f3n y no una imposici\u00f3n, pero la verdad es que va con el rollo del juego de todo bonito y tal, de compartir, pero quita la experiencia al segundo jugador. 2do: el online es tan mediocre y fastidioso que uno se lo tiene que pensar antes de visitar a una isla o recibir visitas. \u201cAlguien est\u00e1 llegando a tu isla\u201d. En conclusi\u00f3n: un verdadero must. Pagu\u00e9 46\u20ac y los volver\u00eda a pagar y volver\u00eda a gastar 210 horas en hacer de mi isla un hogar.","Excelente juego. Super entretenido y adictivo. Me encanta el realismo contrastante en los bichos, peces, f\u00f3siles y obras de arte con el resto del juego.","Animal Crossing is a very fun game to play, mostly in the beginning. First off you're first two islanders are not totally random as the male will always be a Jock villager and the female will always be an Uchi villager. So in those regards if you're favorite villager is in one of those two categories then you could just keep soft resetting until you get one of them.  Now there is a lot to do once you begin like fishing and catching bugs for your museum, but there is a lot of halt in progress in trying to get materials once you need to open the shop and it is expected in Animal Crossing that you will need to wait for it to open. There's really no problem with this and if you can't really wait just time travel a day ahead if you really don't wanna wait, it just depends on how you want to play. Now as of now it seems like a just long halt waiting for something new to happen. Of course since it's now June there is a lot more fish and bugs you're able to catch so that can give you something to do, but what happens when you catch everything you need? It seems like a cycle of just waiting for something new to come or just hoping a new event will happen soon, but besides that right now we need some quality of life changes. Like being able to access materials from home, people able to craft multiple things at once, etc. We got an upgraded inventory and it still feels small having to hold all these materials around all the time. Now moving on the topic of villagers, at least now you don't have to worry about a villager moving away on you randomly since they will always ask if they should leave or not, but it does get a little repetitive talking to them because they mostly say the same things all the time and if you have two of the same personality types of two villagers, you're not seeing double, you're seeing the same dialogue. But besides that, they are at least very interactive now and don't just walk around aimlessly doing nothing. On to the topic of online, since I only really play with one person it doesn't work that badly, but when in a group of people it could be very annoying seeing someone arrive every 5 minutes and having to wait through the loading time. Besides that, it doesn't really feel like there's much to do online, it just feels like you're doing your basic activities but on someone else's island. Sure you could come up with some mini games to play with your friends, that's always an idea, but that's not content from the game. That's you coming up with your own ideas of how to make the game fun. As of right now the game feels very stale, and just waiting around for something new to do isn't very exciting, hopefully we get some new content soon because as of right now everything just feels repetitive.","Love this game. I play it every day.  Slow , easy , relax to layout my land.","Mejor que cualquier juego de Sony. Excelente, divertido, altamente adictivo y preciosista.","Es el mejor juego de switch, sus gr\u00e1ficas tiernas adem\u00e1s entretiene mucho 10 de 10","Not taking in account of second players or multiplayer as those factors will affect the rating. This game is a nice sequel on the switch and the gameplay is nice and subtle over the course of every day as resources take time to gather. it is a nice slice of life game and hope that they will put in the effort to help issues involving additional players to the island.","Buena jugabilidad,tiene muchas opciones implementadas.Tiene varias carencias como por ejemplo no poder crear varias cosas a la vez y problemas leves con la visi\u00f3n ya que no se puede ver bien lo que hay detr\u00e1s de un \u00e1rbol.","So relaxing game I love it best game of the year my boi yes the best nintendo","Got it during the pandemic, and oh boy how happy I was when I got this game. It a laidback and relaxing game. Got 2 Switch just to play this game with my wife. Yes, bought 2 Switches just because of this game. Trading, hunting for villagers, visiting the island, and other stuff during this hard time seems appropriate. Nintendo sure is lucky, they released this game during world lockdown and the sale explodes because of that.","Best community game. I mean this game make me so happy that play with my friends.","Para m\u00ed es el mejor juego de la saga sin duda. He jugado desde Wild World, y las posibilidades que ofrece New Horizons son una maravilla. Siento que han escuchado a los fans, que antes hac\u00edamos caminos y personaliz\u00e1bamos el pueblo con dise\u00f1os, al implementar el terraforming. Que puedan ponerse muebles en todo el exterior hace que tu isla pueda ser \u00fanica, es la evoluci\u00f3n que esperaba de la saga, la que siempre dese\u00e9. Adem\u00e1s, hay much\u00edsimas opciones de ropa y personalizaci\u00f3n del personaje. Los cambios por estaciones son geniales, los gr\u00e1ficos son bonitos, la m\u00fasica es relajante, la sensaci\u00f3n al jugarlo es muy agradable. Siento que tengo un lugar al que huir del estr\u00e9s.No le doy un diez por algunas cosas: no me gusta encontrarme casi siempre los mismos muebles en la tienda, de los mismos colores, ni que me den casi siempre las mismas recetas. Por otro lado, las conversaciones con los vecinos se hacen un poco repetitivas. Las introducciones de Canela son tan repetitivas y aburridas que las paso sin leerlas, lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible. Y aunque no viajo en el tiempo (me parece que cada uno puede jugar como le plazca), no me gusta depender de las actualizaciones para tener el juego completo, en mi casa el internet no es bueno y muchas veces no tengo siquiera conexi\u00f3n. Por otra parte, decir que es normal que s\u00f3lo se pueda tener una isla por juego, en todos los Animal Crossing s\u00f3lo puedes tener un pueblo por juego, es exactamente lo mismo. Lo que no me parece bien es que la isla est\u00e9 ligada a la consola, lo veo un gran error. Si compras otro juego, deber\u00edas tener otra isla, que para eso lo has pagado.","El juego es bueno, el apartado t\u00e9cnico est\u00e1 muy bien y en general es muy entretenido para dedicarle un tiempo diariamente. La limitaci\u00f3n de una isla por consola y el multijugador local es algo que puede ser mejorado.","This is the best Animal Crossing game and in my opinion the second best Switch game. It is dumb that you can only have one island per console but it isnt a huge problem for me because i only want one island","a pleasant getaway from reality with lots of different ways to be creative and make your own unique island. only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 is i wish there were more ways to interact with the environment, but with updates constantly being made i'm sure that will be fixed. A game to play for years to come!","This Game it's amazing.It's a verte addictive game. The graphics look really good. I love the Game","Fun game. Updated from the ds days. Hours of fun. Would recommend to everyone","It's a relaxing and really nice game, it looks really good. Interesting, good game overall.","A good game, suitable for playing with friends. I will play every day. The animals are cute.","I see alot of hate on this game for only having one main player and to that I say does it really deserve a 0?","Best game for those who likes to sit back and enjoy their game. Also for those who wants to test their creativity!","Un juego que viene de maravilla en estos tiempos de cuarentena.\rAdictivo a m\u00e1s no poder, ayuda a sociabilizar con otras personas a\u00fan en distancia y posee jugador local, aunque al final los invitados son como los esclavos del due\u00f1o de la isla XD supongo que se hizo as\u00ed para que no dejaran la cagadita en la isla y lo cual tiene sentido, pasaba lo mismo con New Leaf. As\u00ed que no comprendo a esa gente que se queja de \"un rey, 7 esclavos\" evidentemente jam\u00e1s jugaron un animal crossing... o se trata de un anti nintendo que le molesta saber que este juego tiene muchisimo potencial y no en sus juegos de su consola favorita.\r Interesante eso de poder decorar sin necesidad de tr\u00e1mites en el uso de muebles tanto interior como exterior de tu casa, lo cu\u00e1l abre la puerta a m\u00e1s posibilidades.\r El \u00fanico aspecto negativo del juego lamentablemente cae en lo m\u00e1s importante del juego. Los condenados animales del AC.\r\u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\rPorque al parecer los desarrolladores estaban m\u00e1s ocupados en hacerle caso a lo que ped\u00edan los youtubers que en su vida hab\u00edan tocado el juego ni con un palo y por mera moda ped\u00edan cosas como m\u00e1s gente en el online, que estoy en un 100% seguro que no todos lo usan a full. Basta que uno tenga mal conexi\u00f3n y toda la diversi\u00f3n termina en el tacho de basura.\r Nuevamente los animales se sienten como bots, que dependiendo de su naturaleza gru\u00f1ona o feliz, etc, siempre dir\u00e1n lo mismo. Por lo cual es decepcionante. Estamos hablando de m\u00e1s de 300 animales y fallan en la profundidad de dichos, cosas que en juegos anteriores si pose\u00edan e incluso secretos de cada uno, que ac\u00e1 son inexistentes, al menos en todo el tiempo que lo llevo jugando.\r Por eso nada m\u00e1s le ha costado llevarse el \u00faltimo punto para llegar al 10, en algo que debiera ser primordial, hacer m\u00e1s \"natural\" en los animales y que no se sientan como bots.\r Muchas gracias youtubers caquitas que piden cosas demasiado est\u00fapidas, s\u00f3lo para hacer que m\u00e1s gente participe en sus directos que m\u00e1s que seguro ya ni usan.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons es la secuela que he estado esperando, proporcionando innumerables horas de juego y siendo una experiencia casi perfecta, definitivamente se ha modernizado, conservando ese estilo de juego cl\u00e1sico que se ha vuelto tan ic\u00f3nico. Tiene un sistema gratificante en su lugar, y tantas nuevas mec\u00e1nicas interesantes para aprender, este es sin es uno de los mejores juegos de la Nintendo Switch.","Bruh just the 5.3 user score:\rThe multiplayer sucks,\rOnly one island per console.\rLook new leaf","This game is very good.\rBut I don't know why user ratings are being attacked.\rPerhaps the Forest of Animals will win the Game of the Year in 2020.\rIt's amazing how you can create a game where you can heal with these cute and cute animals when it's not a violent and stimulating game.","This was my escape for the first few weeks of lockdown. Fun and relaxing, I only stopped playing after visiting friends' islands and seeing how much time they put into them and realising there was no way I was going to do the same.","Es una combinaci\u00f3n de relajaci\u00f3n y diversi\u00f3n. Hay tanto por hacer que el proceso de mejorar tu isla y decorarla a tu gusto se vuelve adictivo. Deber\u00edan de quitar la opci\u00f3n de una isla por consola, es est\u00fapido.\r Propongo una lista de juegos que pueden curar los malos d\u00edas, la tristeza, la depresi\u00f3n y el estr\u00e9s, Animal Crossing: New Horizons formar\u00eda parte de ella.","Really enjoyed it. Has some pacing issues and if you don't want to timeskip you run out of stuff to do pretty quickly. If you're an old fan of the series, you're gonna love this one. If you're new to town, get ready for some minor but strange mistakes.","It is a really fun game that I can share with all kinds of gamers. The game aesthetic is charming and customization is incredible. The plot is non existence and the game can grow rote.","Great , \u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 , \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442(","Amazing game :) very beautiful graphics and decorations for you island! I definitely recommend!","Fun and their so much to do. Being building my island for months and still do not get tired of it.","This is very cool game! I like this game sorry my English very bad very cool lol","While I would give this game a 10/10 the fact that there is only one island per switch is kinda garbage but the game is really fun","It\u2019s a great game, but it\u2019s not GOTY contender. I was done with it in about a week, which is a compliment, I sunk a lot of hours into building up my island. The problem with this game is that after I beat it, I had no urge to go back. I had no thoughts about it, no anything. For me, to be a GOTY contender, a game has to leave a lasting impression on you, this game was fun the moment but that\u2019s as far as it went.","Veo que uno de los problemas que se comenta en toda review es la funcionalidad de una isla por consola. Hijos m\u00edos, esto lleva funcionando as\u00ed, por lo menos, desde el Wild World. No s\u00e9 cu\u00e1l es la sorpresa.\r El juego tiene una calidad gr\u00e1fica y sonora sublime. Las animaciones est\u00e1n pulidas y se nota que Nintendo le quiere ponerle mimo al juego al comprometerse a ir actualiz\u00e1ndolo a medida que pase el tiempo.\r Como contras dir\u00e9 lo siguiente: La cantidad de objetos del juego es escasa, a mi parecer. Los eventos semanales son bastante repetitivos: Que si viene Gandulio, que si viene CJ, que si vuelve a venir Gandulio... Sin embargo, no me quejo tanto de que vengan de vez en cuando estos personajes, sino de que resulta realmente dif\u00edcil que venga Ladino.\r Como detalle neutral dir\u00e9 lo siguiente: El sistema de edici\u00f3n f\u00edsica de la isla es incre\u00edble, pero se hecha en falta poder hacer puentes sobre terrenos y no s\u00f3lo sobre r\u00edos, o el poder hacer t\u00faneles, al cavar una secci\u00f3n de tierra bajo otra, etc.","La mejor versi\u00f3n de Animal Crossing y el mejor complemento para jugar en compa\u00f1\u00eda.","Without a doubt, the thousands of customization options in the game allow everyone to have an island to their liking. The online multiplayer mode is as good as its predecessor games, the only thing that it does not preserve is the possibility of meeting unknown people, which was very good if you had no friends. The part that multiple people share the same island on the same console is something that all the games in the series have done, I share an island with 3 other people and we are all satisfied. It is definitely a great game that I have been playing for hundreds of hours. With all the updates they will add, I am sure it will be very difficult for me to stop playing it.","Following your first steps off the plane you\u2019re hit with an awesome sense of adventure. One that continues day after day, there\u2019s plenty to do, see and customise. It\u2019s exactly what people need right now. However a frustrating crafting, inventory and online system is all that stands in the way of New Horizons and a 10.","It's cool, nice to spend some time playing with friends, and I like my neighbors","Muy entretenido y relajante, lo \u00fanico malo es que solo hay una isla para todos los propietarios de la Nintendo, pero no es un problema para m\u00ed ya que solo juego yo.","Great game for passing time, the multiplayer mechanics are pretty bad, but unless you're sharing your switch it's pretty much whatever, the events make for a great way to look forward to the date. The updates give more content in a paced manner that helps the game not feel overwhelming.","De los mejores juegos que hay en la nintendo switch la verdad se merece 10 por el tiempo y calidad de juego que es","If you can get through the waiting it's an amazing game for everyone to enjoy and is always adding new things!","great game, especially if you're not sharing a console with anyone. The ability to redesign your island and move things around is a great addition to the game, though even in this there are some arbitrary buildings/structures that cannot be moved, and this seems silly.\rThe recent announcement for the 'summer update' is a bit insulting to anyone in the Southern Hemisphere, but even the ability for us to have seasons match our own is great.","love the game, is just bad the island lock, and it lacks some features from the old game, but they are updating it so is a 8 for me","Probably the most relaxing game I've ever played and was the biggest comfort I've had during quarantine. For the first three months, I literally could not put it down. I love the amount of customization avaliable and how you and your friends' islands and residents will always be wholely unique.\r After six months of playing on my 5-star island, I do have to admit I've run out of things to do. I only log in once in a while to fill out my catalogue, say hello to my favorite neighbors, or the occasional new idea project that arises. I do really admire how Nintendo puts out monthly updates to keep you interested, though I haven't really found any of them to be super substantial besides the swimming update. I would've liked more quality-of-life improvements to make crafting and decorating more seamless, or even some multiplayer additions. It's always fun to visit my friends' islands and vice versa, though visiting is really the only extent as you can't build or play games together. My time with the game now is more pleasant than it is life-drainingly engaging. But it's hardly something I can really fault the game for, because I put over 170 hours into it! Most games I can't even break 30 hours before I'm tired of it.\r I know I'll never be done with it, even if I don't play it as much now. And I know, I'll be eating up any new Animal Crossing games should they ever make another. For now, I'll keep holding out for a multiple islands update or some multiplayer minigames.","Simplemente adictivo, ideal para la situaci\u00f3n del coronavirus, se va actualizando cada mes, por lo que novedades no faltan, puedes socializar con tus vecinos, etc.","Muy bueno, el problema es que se vuelve repetitivo despu\u00e9s de jugar unas horas, hay solo como 8 islas diferentes y eso se vuelve demasiado castrante","Animal Crossing New Horizons still has the charm of the old games. So many things that the developers have kept the same - with some minor changes.\rI was really excited when the game came out and I played it for about one month straight. I know that this AC is mainly targeting new players, but all in all many things just are a little bit too easy.\rI've filled the fossils in the museum after around 60 days of playing. When I think of Wild World and New Leaf, this felt way too quick. Also to pay your house and all other expenses to Tom Nook was really easy.\rWhat I really like is the new interaction of the villagers, how they are not just simply walking around anymore, but do different kind of actions, they react to the environment and with each other. This is incredibly cute and makes them feel much more lively.\rEven though the developers announce new updates and tried to slow the progress of the game down with the different waiting times for e.x. the museum, the excitement for this game burnt down rather quick.\rAdditionally, I am really bummed about the furniture. There is so much less than in New Leaf and so many sets were thrown out... resulting in always getting the same kind of furniture in Balloons, Trees, the Nook Cranny and so on. And this is kinda frustrating.\rI personally think they did this so you visit other islands more often, but for me Animal Crossing is a game to relax and often I just want to play for myself.\rStill, I am playing Animal Crossing almost daily, as I am excited for the visitors and now with the Summer Update, I love swimming around and collecting more sea life. But I am not playing as much anymore as I was used to. Often I just do the dailys like collecting miles or the DIY recipe (which never results in a new DIY) and that's it.\r BTW: Everyone who hates on \"there is just one island\" has never played an Animal Crossing before - and it shows. They always just had one city for one game. That this wouldn't be different on the Switch was obvious. Just inform yourself correctly and don't blame the game for it.","this game is very relaxing, and i had a lot of fun playing while listening to a podcast or some music.

It misses some things that other animalcrossing had, but that's not a reason to give this game a 0.\r Ignoring all previous animal crossing games, this game by itself will give you enough entertainment to make it a worth purchase. It gives you incentives to play it every day which keeps you coming back and play it, although after a month or so it starts to get repetitive.\rMe and my wife spent ~140h on this game, and we like to share the same island so show/visit each other houses, give items, etc..\r I think this game really lacks coop/multiplayer. So many times I wanted to play with someone and we end up facing each other doing emotes/reactions but chatting on discord/whatsapp.\r Since the game managed to get me hooked for a couple months and made me talk about it with friends and wife, I think it deserves an 8.","Este juego es increible, es infinito, tu le pones el klkimite a este juego, lo malo de ser un juego a tiempo real es que te limita mucho.","absolutely love this game ,first animal crossing game I've played so I can't compare just endless things to do is why I like it alot and building an island is alot of fun , just wish it had vegetables to farm or a few more ways to make money .","The perfect quarantine game. Fun, addicting, and adorable! Just, everything is cute in ACNH!!","Score: 9\r-----------------------------------------------------------------","This is my first animal crossing game , I can see why this series is so popular as it is mainly a life simulator where you build and run your own island with the aide of a cast of adorable and lovable characters. although the gameplay is very repetitive and mostly consists of finding fossils , fishing , crafting tools and furniture , running into characters and doing mini fetch quests , managing finances , that results in your island slowly expanding and getting better. Plus I\u2019m sure more activities and content will be added in overtime. The graphics are good for a switch game and overall the game is very relaxing , charming and addictive. Just the experience needed for 2020. If your a casual fan or a hardcore there is something for you to enjoy. However the amount you get out of this game is limited to how much you enjoy the grind and repetitive gameplay or how creative you are as it offers a vast creation suit.","I think it's a very fun game. Lots to do and customize all the time. Granted it seems to get kind of dull to be sometimes and at some points I just get on, sell fruit and get off. But it's still such a lovely colorful game and the characters are full of fun things to say. It's a very nice game.","Im so sad about this game, it has Not enough here to entice me to come back to it so often like the old games. If your gonna make a game so bland at least have good characters! These characters are boring with nothing good to do but walk around. In older games they acted like people. They could invite you over, have parties, actually be rude, and even give you tasks. In this you walk around, catch bugs, and earn money. That\u2019s all there is to do. Gone is the interesting gameplay. But even the crapiest of games has some good. While I am playing the story based part of the game I had a grand old time. Tom Nook is actually pretty funny, and it\u2019s fun. The rest is boring. Again I\u2019m so sad to say this","It's cute, engaging, and has daily short term + long term goals.  Yah, I guess having 1 island shared between two or more users is a downer, but no one has explored the idea to create an expansive island, with CRAZY HOMES.  If Nintendo could make 1 change, I'd request for villagers to have multi level homes that you could customize.  The game has reached a point, after 1-2 months, where you're limited to only the Island itself + your home, as the sandbox.  Giving control and additional creative freedom within villager homes would, imo, stay true to animal crossing whilst allowing players to appreciate their villagers more so, than simply gifting.","In my opinion this is one of the best games for Nintendo switch. There is so much to do, I have spent almost 300 hours in this game and I am still not bored. The only real problem I see with this game is that you can only have one island per console which is stupid. For me it is no problem since I am the only one using my switch but for people who share the same console I can see tis being a really big and annoying problem.","It's one of the best switch games I've ever played you can play hundreds of hours collecting fish and insects upgrading your Ireland playing with your friends unlocking new stuff it's addicting I never played Animal Crossing game before but I ride keeps on raining low while I got to seen cuz you only have one Island to f****** cares well I haven't played any other games but still it's still great game even if you get one Island if you have a problem with it being a real time based game you can just fast forward it with your system settings on your Nintendo switch they're going to keep on updating game and I saying Go the f*** Ford cuz you it's one of the best game I've ever played if grammar bad it's because I'm using the microphone and not typing and you can just play co-op which is you're going to have to get used to but the controls are very different and having one Island to be a problem if you have Nintendo switch online which is $19.99 a year  so but no ****  but still play this game I'd recommend Halle Berry dating Larry very addicting no wonder its of the tendo switches best sellers","Perfect game for the switch.

My husband  decides where things go, builds shops and bridges and houses, and I get the immense pleasure of....dropping off raw materials in front of his house. Beyond disappointed, what a waste of a purchase!","As someone who doesn't share an island with anyone, I love this game. Cannot stop playing. While the game is being bombarded with 0 star reviews for the one island per console, which is stupid I agree, but apparently they had something similar in New Leaf, and that doesn't get bombarded. Why? I guess it's because that was less of a shared console, and it wasn't quarantine. Or maybe people darling New Leaf because it's nostalgic for them. So I find the criticism really unfair. I play it every day, and I've grown so attached. I love decorating the island, hanging out with my villagers, and just soaking in the atmosphere. I've played for 250 hours and I'm still not in any way bored with it, and don't see myself stopping any time soon, as I haven't nearly done all there is to do. I haven't gotten a 5 star island and I haven't completed the museum. Routine is cool and all, but every day feels like a new adventure to me, not to mention the upcoming updates, which I'm really excited for. This game is one of the few things where I trust the critic score over the user score. Highly recommended.","Solo por que tiene mas cosas merece un 9.9, por que eso lo hace un buen juego, muchas cosas destacada demasiado","Me encanta , es refrescante y muy tranquilizador.Es un juego relajante y divertido , ademas los vecinos me hace sentir acompa\u00f1ado.

My wife and I having to share an island is the worst. If I could refund it. I would.","It suffers from a severe lack of innovation. It uses a the same formula from previous Animal Crossing but extremely watered down. The villagers are still cookie cutter NPCs that have little difference between each other in their respective personality groups. It was good that they brought new features like landscaping and outdoor decoration, but those features highlight the emphasis by the developers to make things look good rather than have actual value.","Only allowing one island per console is very frustrating. other than that i would only be nitpicking to find negatives. Very chill and fun game.","Apparently you can't play together on the same console because buy another one! You're not poor, are you?","I've specifically made an account on MetaCritic to warn people off from this game.\r There is a feature in the game called \"Primary Player.\" This player is the only one who is able to make progress in the game.  There is no way to make another island for other players.  There is no way to transfer power outside deleting the island and restarting.\r If you are buying this for a family, don't.\r Let's talk about dysfunctional relationships.  They are often caused by unilateral decisions and lack of communication.\r The decision to have a primary player is a unilateral decision by the developers despite complaints. It leads to unilateral decisions by the primary player placing their wants and needs over the \"secondary\" players.\r There is no warning for this.  There is no documentation of this.  The only way you find are are reviews and comments online.  In other words, no communication.  Not only that, but it creates a communication inequality within the family.  The \"lead\" player makes the decisions.  They can listen to other players, but they don't need to.  The other players can suggest ideas, but there's no way to delegate or enable other players.\r The game both practices and fosters dysfunctional relationships.  Both between designer and player as well as within the family.\r I gave it a zero because my family cannot play the game.  I bought it for my family.  It is worth zero to me.  If they fix it, or you play it solo, I'd probably give it an 8-10 dependent on later content that I was unable to reach due to the Primary Player bug.","Like the game a lot, had a lot to do and a big change from the last animal crossing.","\ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ud765\ud589\uc744 \ud588\uace0 \ub2cc\ud150\ub3c4 \uc2a4\uc704\uce58\uc758 \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc62c\ub9ac\ub294\ub370\uc5d0 \ud070 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ud790\ub9c1\uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5ec\uc131 \uac8c\uc774\uba38\ub4e4\uc774 \uc120\ud638\ud558\uc600\uace0 \ub300\ub780\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uace0 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc790\uae30 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\uc11c \ud30c\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uc558\ub2e4.","It's a wonderful game each space is magnificent and the stuff is incredible, but is true, the restrictions about made a new island is sad, if I have enough with one switch, I'm not planning buy another one to have the opportunity of build a new island","Not allowing more than one save file per switch?

The terraforming aspect really adds to the game and gives you endless possibilities when it comes to decorating your island. You can build your own decorations and furniture with materials you find, which help towards the goal of reaching a 5* island.The villagers within the game are as adorable as always. An added bonus is that your villagers no longer leave without warning, so you can technically keep your favourite villagers on your island for as long as possible. You can also go out hunting for your next villager which is a fun element.The regular updates keep players hooked to the game, particularly the seasonal updates such as Easter, Halloween, etc. Seasonal updates gives you additional goals to work towards which brings you back to the game yet again.Whilst I always return to New Horizons regularly, I\u2019ve found that in recent months that I spend less and less time playing as I\u2019ve run out of things to do on my island, which is a shame. There\u2019s always the possibility of redecorating your island, but once you\u2019ve finalised your design then it becomes difficult to find tasks to do to keep yourself busy.Another negative that seems quite small, but can become quite frustrating, is the lack of storage. Usually it wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue, however when one big element of the game is to craft items to use across your island, having nowhere to store your materials over time causes you to dump items on your island, bringing the rating down. This is disheartening over time when you can no long aim for a 5* island due to items being dropped on the ground.All in all, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a lovely, relaxing game that keeps you coming back for more. The game could easily be a 10/10 game if some of the small frustrations were fixed.","Amazing graphics amazing gameplay 400 hours already its a magical game and got ppl out of depression furing quartine","I've played the game out of curiosity.

Tras 150 horas de juego sigo divirti\u00e9ndome jug\u00e1ndolo como el primer d\u00eda. Es un juego divertid\u00edsimo, con una jugabilidad tranquila y satisfactoria y con muchas cosas por hacer. El apartado t\u00e9cnico es muy bueno y estable (teniendo en cuenta las limitaciones de la Switch), el art\u00edstico es simplemente excepcional y la m\u00fasica es muy relajante. La historia es tremendamente simple pero sirve como tutorial para empezar a jugar; y el multijugador con amigos puede hacer del juego una experiencia espectacular. Adem\u00e1s, la hora del juego se ajusta a la de la realidad, algo que puede ser bueno, par dividir las horas entre distintos d\u00edas, o malo, ya que te \"obliga\" a conectarte para obtener los beneficios de cada d\u00eda. Entre otras cosas malas est\u00e1 el hecho de que a algunas personas se les puede hacer repetitivo, la escasez de di\u00e1logos e interacciones con los vecinos y la falta de nuevo contenido de anteriores ediciones de Animal Crossing.

It's a relaxing experience.\r Though. They **** need to fix the multiplayer thing, which is utterly trash and so disrespectful for nintendo's fan. I play solo so I don't care, and I will never pay for their online trash service. I would probably never have bought this game if it was to play with my friends or roommate (if I had one).\r When I compare the first AC on GCN to this one, we can clearly see that there are improvements (fortunately, lol). But even if every single details are nice, I'm kinda worried that the interest will wear out in a month or two. Like every AC games. Which is sad because they really could find ways to update it and make it more enjoyable to play, with significant updates like in MMO games. But we know Nintendo, it's never going to be the case. We are going to have cheap updates every 4 months for Valentine, Halloween, Christmas, etc... and that's it. I got it for half the price so I don't really care, but this game is never gonna be worth the full price or the online membership to play with your friends.\r So play it if you're solo and can have it for half the price, or just pass.","Awesome game.

The gameplay feels nice, and the customization is a step up from New Leaf, the first Animal Crossing game I ever played. If you want local, same console multiplayer, this game is not for you. The local, different console multiplayer and online multiplayer where you visit other player islands is really nice. I'd recommend this game if you have a Switch.","Beautiful game but the fact that you can\u2019t have your own island on a different user is very annoying. Been waiting to play the game for ages and I\u2019m now either the awful step-mum that won\u2019t let her step-son change her island etc or I have to fork out another \u00a350 for a new game card!","This game is a masterpiece, the best Animal Crossing. I just cant stop playing it.","This game is great and although there are some problems, such as the island resident and a few others,  it\u00b4s still a great game.","Nintendo, the company that we love that also hates us, really stupid decision for an island per console. I'm feeling robbed.","The fact that nintendo will not budge on their stupid \"one island per console\" scam is disgusting. The november data transfer update still fails to negate the fact that you'd need TWO CONSOLES. Considering this game has spent it's whole existence in the covid crisis when people can't afford to feed their families letalone to go out and buy two or more $300 consoles... you would think the company could be a little less tone deaf. This puts Nintendo ahead of EA games when it comes to corporate greed. They already have a monopoly on many of the most popular IPs in video gaming...","Just love it I LOVE IT IT'S AWESOME I'M IN LOVE OMG IT'S SO COOL REALLY THAT'S SO COOL I RECOMEND IT","Overall it is a good game and a great entry point for those who are new to the series.\rThe art direction,  music and design screams polish. BUT for those who are familiar with the series this game will likely leave you disappointed because the content just isn't there to keep you entertained once you have gone through the new features.","Not worth the buy unless your a rich person. Sharing one island with other people can get really annoying, especially when you want to progress but you can not without the island owner progressing first. Its a huge waste of money, and Nintendo is just trying to take all your money from you.","People basing their entire reviews on the single aspect of only being able to create one island per game is ridiculous, and the fact that Animal Crossing New Horizons has a user review of 5.5 almost solely because of this issue is just angering to me. This game would almost certainly have a score of 9.0 if you all weren't so petty.  While I agree it is frustrating, since you can't even create an additional island if you bought a second copy, (since it saves to the device and not to the game itself) but this is not new. It's been like this in every version of the game that has been released. Animal Crossing has always been an extremely innovative, fun, and relaxing game. I've played every game since the first American version on the GameCube, and each release is better than the last. Always with more things to do than the one before it. If you haven't played an Animal Crossing game yet, I would strongly recommend you ignore the poorly thought out reviews, and try it for yourself. Take some time to read the reviews of previous versions, or listen to fans of the games to hear about all the fun you can have. Animal crossing is great in the way that it gives you a reason to come on and play everyday throughout the year.","Got this for my 4 year old daughter and Im helping her read it and get set up. My 8 year old son wanted to have a go since it's his switch and daughter was happy for him to make his own island and play it sometimes. Only issue is you are only allowed to make one island... Ever. I don't want him playing her island and rushing past the tutorials as she needs the help to understand what to do.So until nintendo make the simple addition of multiple save slots ie like every Mario game they've ever made, then the rating will have to be a 0 due to the problems this decision has made for us. Kids aren't happy.","This is my first Animal Crossing, and I cannot stop playing, it is a very relaxing game and has a lot of things to do, really linking it so far.","This animal crossing includes many improvements that I like and, this game will give you many hours of fun. It should be noted that the searches for neighbors with tickets are very good. You must play this game.","El juego es bastante bueno sobre todo los 2 primeros meses, es entretenido y relajante sin embargo despu\u00e9s de much\u00edsimo tiempo mi inter\u00e9s por el juego fue disminuyendo\rpd: una cosa que me molesta bastante del juego es que sus tiempos de carga son muy lentos","i spent so much money on this game and tbh it just was sooooo boring. i expected to love it like everyone else but i genuinely found ymself invested for ??? a month at most then never picked it up ever again.","I love acnh (animal crossing new horizons) it looks great but after 4 months and no time traveling it gets a little boring still play it every day!.The story to get k.k. (a dog who sings) on my island was fun and making my dream island is fun too.If that add new stuff then it would be a 10 or 9!","A very fun and relaxing game, suitable for all ages! I particularly liked the different festivals that periodically take place on the island","When I first got my hands on animal Crossing new horizons I spent almost every awake minute on it.. Building my village from scratch it was very enjoyable and I found myself spending way too much time on it.However I actually stopped playing the game after the Holloween patch I felt it was starting to get very bland and very boring real fast yes.. this could be because I did play the crap out of it but it was the similar situation on the Nintendo 3DS where I found myself playing for long period of time and then just figuring out that is quite boring and that\u2019s coming from a guy who spent 200 hours+ on the game.All in all Animal crossing new horizons is a great game to start off your Nintendo journey however play for as long as you like you don\u2019t necessarily need to pay for the rest of your life but I do recommend you play it up to a certain point. A point where you\u2019re happy with your village and everything is going smoothly. To which then you can probably move on to another game. The reason why I didn\u2019t give it 10 out of 10 is.. I feel like Nintendo has started to throw in elements which aren\u2019t really related to the animal Crossing franchise they just do it for the fan base or an excuse to hype gamers into playing it again.I might or might not find myself playing it in the future that\u2019s disappointing because I love animal Crossing. Also it has become even more bland as people have started to cheat and started selling Animal crossing items, money, tickets etc on the Internet which ultimately made the game even more dull as obtaining items have become meh.","I bought the game for me and my 6 year old daughter to play separately, occasionally together with co-op. One save file per game is not ideal whatsoever. A 6 year old playing a game like this can be chaotic, to put it lightly. Not being able to have my OWN personal experience in this game is a gigantic downfall.\r It's very obvious that nintendo wants to sell more consoles. I'm not giving them my money and I suppose I'm also not playing animal crossing anymore either.\r Thanks for the royal **** up Nintendo.","I've been playing Animal Crossing games since the very first. New Horizons is better in countless ways. New Leaf is the only other game I can think that had a handful of features that I wished made it to New Horizons. I'm over 100 hours in and still loving it.","I'm about to enter 2021, I can't understand why Nintendo, with its dire and incomprehensible decisions, spoils one of the best games that has been released this year on its portable console, making the absurd decision to allow only one island per console, limiting greatly increasing the game options to users who have not started the game, and forcing those players to play on the island that the first user created, limiting progress to the pace of the creator of the island. There is not even the option to buy another game for the same console, if you want to play on your own island, your only option is to buy a new console (\u20ac 350). Thank you very much NINTENDO, thank you for taking care of and thinking about the people who feed you, your players.","Big hype like for that boring gam\u0119.

I feel the holidays are worse in this than previous games. The base model of the game had huge potential but they missed the mark on content. They need to innovate. It hurt when my friends gave up on it within a year and I gave up in just over. I didn't like how unattainable and unnecessary some of the achievements were. Seems they set the bar high for tedious things because there is so little to do in other aspects of the game. Very much satisfied and also disappointed; this might be the end of my interest in this series.","First things first let me just be clear here. I've been playing this game since the day it first came on March 20, 2020 so I have seen every single thing that the game has to offer. I do not hate New Horizons its still a good game despite the flaws it has. So anyways I feel stuck on what to do next? I completed my museum (all fossils, sea creatures, bugs, fish, statues, and paintings), terraformed my island the way I wanted it to be, and got the villagers that I wanted so now I am just asking myself \"what do I do now?\". This question has been bothering me for the longest time.\r I seen all the events and they were fun for the time and whenever there was new stuff added I would be interested and try it out and then after about a day I get bored so quickly. I try to motivate myself to keep playing daily but it just doesn't feel good anymore. I have a lot of Nook Miles which I probably am not going to use given that I already finished hunting for villagers using nook mile tickets and I got amiibo cards last year. I guess what I'm trying to say is the game just feels stale and really lacks longevity. If anyone asks I did time travel. Only because it just took too long to like order stuff from the Nook Shopping and you are forced to wait a day until it comes tomorrow which was getting pretty annoying. I did the same thing when first building bridges and inclines when I was still making my island last year.\r Ihis game feels like a Happy Home Designer 2.0 where it focus a lot more on designing rather than building a community. I try to feel more relax in New Horizons but because of how terrible the Villager dialogue is I just cannot do it. I took a break from this game, came back hoping something actually would happen for the 1 year anniversary but nope all I got was a cake and the villagers just repeat the same topics.","To put it simply, this series thrives more than any other I know of on its long term appeal. Traditionally the series has done this primarily by filling the game with such an abundance of content that you can play for years and still be surprised and see new things occasionally. This particular game in the series has FAR less content to support its long term appeal than ANY other game in the series long history, despite the fact that the majority of the features it does have are not even new.\r Yes, they are releasing free content updates occasionally. But at the rate they are going with these updates, it would take many many years to even catch up to this games predecessor in terms of content (AC: New Leaf, 3DS), let alone surpass it.\r This game has made a number of improvements to the formula, but it's severe lack of content kills it for me. It takes quite a few hours of playing for you to really notice how much less this game has, but once you really get a feel for that it is hard for me to still give this game any praise. I have very little hope that Nintendo is every going to fully correct this unless they seriously step up their game with the updates.","Earlier Animal Crossing games are better, the DLC requires subscription, and my daughter can't have a different island than mine.","I was super exited for this game when it was first announced. Animal Crossing is my favorite video game series. The wait was brutal, but was it worth it in the end? I'd say it is! The graphics look pretty nice, the music is cheery and relaxing, and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games! This game isn't perfect though. It doesn't actually become like Animal Crossing for 10-20 hours. The good news is it's still fun during the beginning. The whole crafting mechanic is really only for those early hours. Once I livened up my island (cleverly named Island), I rarely ever crafted after that. I don't appreciate how desperate it is to be different from the rest of the series, because I really miss some of the old characters. I do love the new ones, and at least Dr. Shrunk isn't in this game... But I did have some problems. For one thing, why is there still a 10 villager limit? The first game had 15! Island is big enough to fit a few extra people (or animals)! I'd even settle for 12! Also when you use a Nook Miles ticket to visit a deserted island? It's a really cool idea, but the island is way too tiny, so there's nothing to do, and a villager will only appear there when your town isn't full. I really want to get some of the new villagers, but I can't when it's restricting your opportunities. Granted, I was lucky enough to find Judy, a new cub, on an island, but that was after farming like 10 tickets! Also, there have only been 8 new villagers shown at this point! Are those the only new ones? I mean, I really like them, but that's just pitiful. The amiibo functionality is good too, but the crossover villagers from Welcome Amiibo aren't in this game! I miss Inkwell... Also you just have to get extremely lucky to get a new villager. I really want Cyd the elephant and Raymond the cat in my town, but there's no amiibo for them... I'm suprised that I was able to talk about the negatives for so long... Now on to the positives! Let me just say I haven't been this happy playing a video game since...maybe never. This might be the happiest game ever made. I bet it could cure depression (I'm serious)! The characters in this game are way cuter and funnier here than in any other Animal Crossing game. Everyone has their favorite one/ones, but this gave me several new favorites, and I love my old favorites even more! This game also has a lot of funny dialogue (maybe more than Paper Mario: Color Splash). This game has so much personality, and I love it! Its just so much fun! Even pulling weeds is fun now! This game is my 3rd favorite Animal Crossing game, my 4th favorite Switch game, and is probably in my top 20 games of all time! It really satisfied my expectations. It was pretty much exactly as good as I thought it would be. Most games nowadays are either slightly better or slightly worse than you expect it to be. The delays and stuff were really painful, but it was worth the wait, and every Switch owner needs this game! (Also why are so many people complaining about the first player doing all the hard work for you? The others players get to enjoy Animal Crossing sooner.)","Biggest issue = One island per Switch\r Other than that the user interface is testing your patience. For example, if you have a stack of say 40 weeds and you would like to take 20 to sell them you have to separate one by one until you have 20 additional single weeds in your inventory and after that you have to put them together to a 20 piece stack. Letting you click at least 60 times to do that. There are plenty of other such instances. It is just Ridiculous!","So I had written another review where I gave Animal Crossing: New Horizons a score of 10. On the anniversary of the game, I lower it back to 5 as the developers did NOT deliver the updates that they had promised. The game is barren, and nothing changed since last March when the game launched. For a long-term game like ACNH, this is unacceptable. Update by update, it just got more boring.","As someone who's gotten into Animal Crossing through Pocket Camp among other things, I enjoy playin' this game way more (even though this series would be right at home on a phone now), but it has many flaws and lacks a ton of things.\r For one, the villagers should have their own unique personality to set 'em apart from each other. They're a main part of this little series, yet there's nothing interesting about 'em other than appearance. Personality-wise, there's zero distinction between, say, Beau and Puck for example. In general, you give a villager a gift, they mindlessly accept it as the best thing ever. The only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to their looks, not really what they say and it makes 'em bland. They never show any emotion other than absolute happiness. It's feels like a utopia (which I ironically wanted to name my island at one point). Everything is supposedly so perfect and no one ever has anything to talk about other than positive vibes only. It feels so feels artificial. By the way... I don't think it would hurt to have romance. It is fictional and the villagers have anthropomorphic qualities.\r Anyway, special characters aren't much better. The Able Sisters, specifically Sable, is the only one of the three with any kind of interesting dialog and that ain't sayin' a lot. Now that I think about it... STOP with the non-existent conversation trees. Everyone blasted the hell outta Pok\u00e9mon Sword &amp; Shield for the same thing (if you could even call it that), but of all games, Animal Crossing should be actually doing it. What's the point of choosing dialog when it either amounts to nothin' or has the same outcome as the other choice. Anyway, there's another thing that annoys me: the island sandbox. Why is it that every game uses this formulaic Minecraft-like \"world\" layout (actually, that would be insulting Minecraft's world generation since it's actually vast compared to Animal Crossing's hub world generation)? It'd be really nice if they designed an actual world instead of just \"Hey, there's this new thing happening right now. Here's your new home. Have a good life!\". Oh, and why don't villager homes expand? It'd be pretty cool if they also invited you to their homes for whatever reason. I could imagine Muffy inviting me to a sleepover or Beau and Puck wanting me to watch TV together.\r Another reason I'm mixed on this game is that I wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin', bug catchin', shell collectin', fossil huntin', flower planting, and island designing that's been in every game. With all these props in the game, you'd think you could interact with more than a handful of 'em in a more interesting way. Y'know, something akin to those two 3DS minigames from New Leaf, but expand that to certain items. Maybe have villagers occasionally challenge you to a match? Also, I think the game should really move on from the overhead view. It'd be nice to see everything with a free camera. It's aesthetically dull when every building or object is or has to be oriented forward to work with the overhead view.\r I almost never use local multiplayer since I do thing on my own in this game and people got me covered on why online is lame.\r It's dumb how cloud saves weren't a thing from the start (even though the way it is still kinda ass). Is cheating really that big of a problem in a game where you create your own experience? Are you serious? It'd be one thing if somethin' like this was runnin' rampant online in multiplayer games, but come on. If people rather stick to the legit way of playin', that's their decision. If people rather put their time into moddin' the game to speed up the progress or whatever, that's their decision. Simple. Whether they regret it or not in the long run is on them. Or god forbit someone simply wanted to have fun changing stuff on their game, affecting no one in the process.\r I like this franchise, but there's a LOT of room for improvement; I didn't talk about all the problems or thoughts I had on this game and the series as a whole. Maybe some of the game's issues will be patched. I'm not optimistic though. The day this series upgrades from being a budget version of The Sims is the day I can truly call it good","How cool to be the only player on the console.\rWell, if about the game - live, trade, build, fish, travel, catch bugs, pay a loan, pay a loan, pay a loan, rebuild the island. And you will find that you have only 3 stars out of 5.\rThe best life simulator for quarantined people.","Amazingly incredible! Creative gameplay and something totally incomum in nowadays gaming!

The slow pace admittedly isn't for anyone, but it's perfect to pick up for an hour each day and just explore your island.","So much missing content in this game, no NPC\u2019s. Your villagers are all boring and have the same dialogue. The island customization is fun but everything else has no substance.","UPDATED REVIEW:\rAnimal Crossing WAS a great game, we were promised so much and the initial release was great since there was so much to explore and everything was new.\rSadly that initial state of the game stayed...even until today. AC:NH has not gotten any major update for a long long time. Even the major updates that happened last year wore off already.\r Nintendo really promised us 3 (or so) years of updates, sadly what they meant is 3 years of the same god-damn events every time. Gets quite sickening.\r The villagers are also getting tiring, same dialogue, same robotic interactions. Not fun anymore.\r I've spent 100hrs in this game and that's it to be honest, the game is stale and not fun anymore.\rEverything just feels really old and boring and there's nothing new to do.\r This is part of a bigger problem of Nintendo, over the years they started slacking more and more. Yes they do release amazing games every now and then (Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild) but a lot of their releases feel very \"clean\" with no life in them.\r OLD REVIEW 9/10 (Jun 28, 2020) :\rThis game is amazing.\r Animal Crossing is a game in which you can just sit back and relax to. A perfect game to escape reality with. The control is in your hands as you land on a deserted island with nothing but tents, you can build a thriving community. I love it!\r With each new day you get access to new components of the game, yeah some might call it an unnecessary hindrance but this allows for a fresh dose of content each new day. Animal Crossing isn't about completing EVERYTHING in a day or two. You really do have to invest a lot of time and the game rewards you for doing so. Yeah not for everyone but for those who love games such as Stardew Valley this game is perfect.\r The villagers (or I suppose Islanders) are very charismatic and make the island that much more fun. Yeah not all of them are great but there are just so many villagers that you can easily pick out your favourites and invite them to your island.\r I love this game, I really do but I am also not a fan of the idea of singular saves per console. It really annoys me, I personally don't share my switch with my family as they don't care for Nintendo games but this is really spoiling the fun for others, also there is currently no CLOUD SAVING even though Nintendo brags about having that option for the NSO Subscribers. I hope Nintendo gets a grip and address this issue in the next update(s). Other than that I honestly have not major complaints.","I really love this game but the one thing that really bums me out is that I will never be able to play most of the time based events such as the fishing tourney due to work. I wish these events were 24 hours or have them split in the day like a morning tourney and a night tourney so that people who work can enjoy this part of the game. All day today my co workers and I who own ACNH lamented that we worked 9-6 and would miss out on the first fishing tourney of the year and then to find out this event only happens 4 times a year on Saturdays so we will never have this experience is upsetting.","This game is great! If you have your own switch that is. Me and my brother bought a copy of the game excited to start our own islands, but little did we know after him starting the island we had to share it. Since he's the mayor he's always one step ahead of me in everything and has more privileges than I do. Alot of people tell me \"it's tradition in the franchise\" but I think it's time for a change. I can afford a second copy but I'd still have to share the island and quite frankly that's an EA move. As a resident I give it a 3 but if I had my own island I'd give it a 10. Wake up Nintendo, wake up and smell the ashes.","WARNING:\r this game makes you suffer psychosomatic disorders.\r it starts gradually, and then it gets worse, and worse and worse.\r which is why 1) people get testy and argue with their bf/gf/wife/hubby/siblings\r which is why 2) people have to take a break from the game. because when playing this loop, they are reportedly much more mentally fragile, get triggered easily, suffer bouts of mania, and have mental breakdowns\r 3) which is why people hit plateu here after that initial high. it's addictive but not in a fun game sorta way, but like addiction proper. nook miles become external goals that prevent your brain from ever \"finishing\" aka getting some rest.\r don't let this game ruin your life. it's not cute, it's a dreadful game that wreaks havoc on your mental health once you see it for what it is.","2nd accounts (the one that is \"not\" creator of the island) can not advance at the same pace as the principal...

But rate 0 for this game just because it have one island per 1 console isn't fair. I play alone so i haven't got problems with this.","Animal Crossing New Horizons is just as addictive as ever. The visuals are improved and the core gameplay is engaging if you're looking for a relaxing experience. However, the game isn't without some major flaws.\r I'm not a big fan of the loading times to get into the game.  You sit through a load to get to the title screen, then another to be greeted by Isabelle, followed by another load screen to finally start playing the game. It's unacceptable that it takes longer to load into ACNH than it takes to load into a massive game like Breath of the Wild.\r Also, there's the big issue of \"One island per console\".  This would've been made a little better if it were possible to change the \"main player\" after starting an island. I wonder how many people started with one primary player who no longer has any interest in playing. Now you're faced with the choice of continuing with your limited experience or starting over and losing everything.\r This game could be the best game on Switch, but it's plagued by some serious issues that brings the game down for me.","A fantastic game to casually play on and off, but too many small issues keep it from greatness.","This game deserved to be the game of the year, it is relaxing and super calm. It's a little management game where you have to manage your island,","Es una delicia. El juego explota su genero al 100% salio el 2020 un a\u00f1o de pandemia donde todos pudimos encontrarnos con nuestros amigos por este juego, las notas 0 son de pura envidia, no le haga caso a estos gringos SONYERS borregos del amo sony, que nunca tendr\u00e1n un juego as\u00ed en su consola.","I like it, every day something different happens. But it kinda gets boring after time","Hundreds of hours of content, beautiful graphics... This game is a very good one, it should just have better menus","To me the game is pretty good I don't have to deal with the whole 2 player thing I do enjoy the game but it gets boring after awhile doing the same stuff","It's really fun and the reason I bought my Switch, but I feel it lacking since the 60th hour or so... I keep doing my daily routine because it's nice and lovely in graphics, music and vibes, but I find myself playing Pok\u00e9mon White in an emulator much more these days, more than a hundred hours after starting the game for the first time.","\u0130f you are the only person using Your Switch, it is a fun  game. But if you are the second person and another person has alredy a island, being p2 in New horizons sucks. Except  this problem it\u2019s a pretty good game","Animal Crossing: New Horizons hat 2020 definitiv ein ganzes St\u00fcck ertr\u00e4glicher gemacht.","Animal Crossing. An international video game franchise that has impacted the lives of millions. The brand new follow up game has been released. I mean, when I went to go get my copy of this game, I waited in line for at least half an hour. But guess what? It was 110% worth it! I would have waited 2 hours in line if that meant I could wrap my hands around this mysterious wonder! It is such a peaceful, violence free, fantastic game that is great for anyone of any age. Today, I\u2019m going to tell you how much of a great game Animal Crossing: New Horizons is. Without further ado, let\u2019s get right into it!First, you need to know what Animal Crossing: New Horizons is all about. It starts off with you, buying the Deserted Island Getaway Package. You are dropped off at a completely deserted island along with a few other random villagers. What I mean by villagers is talking animals which each have completely different personalities! For example, Jitters, the green duck who can never get enough exercise. He even dreams about running thousands of miles a day without stopping. Or Bubbles, the hippo always wearing dresses who can never stop talking about becoming a pop star. The island starts out covered in weeds and is swarming with bugs. All you and your fellow islanders have are tents with radios but as you progress, your island does too. You and other villagers begin to live in houses which you can customize to the very last piece of furniture. A museum is forged which displays fossils, art, fish and bugs that you gather. A convenience store is built where you can sell almost anything for some extra cash. The tailor shop is made which sells the finest of clothing. A town hall is installed which provides all necessary help and information to make an island that suits you! Every time I show my mom this game, she falls asleep because of the beautiful songs that the birds sing and the image of a tree\u2019s leaves getting rustled by the gusting wind,which leads me to my next point. The audio is so realistic and the visuals are calming, colorful and just a pleasure to glance at. This game is set with real time so when it\u2019s dark out in real life, the shooting stars rain from the dark night sky in this never ending story.  Plus, you will never get bored! There are always things to do like do favors for villagers, make some paths or even expand your house! The amount of lively energy that was poured into this amazing creation is incredible! Islanders now send you mail, do yoga in front of the town hall, talk to each other about starting bands and even doing daily activities like fishing. Even for people who don\u2019t like video games, you should give this beautiful piece of art a shot! I guarantee you will enjoy every last minute of it! Animal Crossing: New Horizons is truly a magical experience and almost whimsical.","Don't get me wrong this is amazing, but that's only if no one else is playing ANCH on your Nintendo Switch. The devs put in a feature into the game where if more than one user is playing the game on the same console then you can't do story mode and for that single feature I give this game a zero and don't recommend unless you have more than one console for each person playing Animal Crossing","i would give the game a ten out of ten but the crafting system doesn't allow for you to craft multiples of items that seem like they should have a multi craft (fishing bait), manilla clams don't stack even though they aren't furniture or a donateable creature to the museum, and 1 island per switch console as a person who has always bought either multiple copies or memory cards to play multiple towns this breaks my heart as a die hard animal crossing fan, scorpion spawn rate was nerfed too heavily to the point that catching multiple is almost annoying because theyll fall into water or theyre will be a water bug that you cant see in any of the views for the camera. if the game fixes these issues i would deffinitly give it a 10 /10.","In theory - this supposed to be the most sandboxy sandbox of them all. But sadly, this game feels like... job? I mean, I like always having something to do but in here it's just so forced and come on - artificial restrictions of the gameplay based on real life time? Who came up with this nonsense?\rGet when discounted and play when you don't have anything engaging. A coffee break timewaster. This is what this game really is.","Simplesmente fant\u00e1stico! Fiquei com muito receio de adquirir esse game, principalmente pelo estilo de jogo, que nunca foi muito atraente para mim, mas acreditem, vale muito cada centavo!\rPontos positivos: Trilha sonora, gameplay, imers\u00e3o, relaxamento ( isso \u00e9 muito real!! n\u00e3o lembro de jogar um game que me acalmasse tanto, ele est\u00e1 sendo uma verdadeira terapia nesse nebuloso ano de 2020)\rPontos negativos: v\u00edcio!  Ele vai fazer parte da sua rotina di\u00e1ria e voc\u00ea pode deixar de fazer afazeres essenciais na sua vida.\r Enfim, ele \u00e9 diferente de tudo que j\u00e1 me apaixonei no mundo dos games. Ele me fez rever muitos conceitos e preconceitos que tinha nesse estilo de jogo.\rEstive, estou e estarei amando esse game, pois acredito que vai fazer parte da minha vida durante um bom tempo...","Such an amazing game, but why do I get so burnt out? I don't know if it's my fault or the game's, but it definitely does negatively affect my feelings towards the game. Also there's just some small stuff that would make the game a lot more enjoyable that Nintendo just keeps on not implementing. Still really amazing though.","Stopped playing this game months ago after amassing 100's of hours and just getting bored.Decided to start it up again today, to make a new island, to see whats new......couldnt bring myself to have to \"delete\" my old island.**** you nintendo.","Total Score: 52/100 - Although this can be fun and addicting, the fact that Nintendo is deliberately promoting patch culture instead of just making a quality game from the start is disgraceful. They could make sure Mario Odyssey was great, but this game? Nah. This could almost be excused if this still didn\u2019t run on actual time. Games shouldn\u2019t be played like they\u2019re a job. You should be able to play the game on your time not theirs. This game is extremely unrewarding to the point you\u2019re forced to exploit the game for money. Sadly these exploits have been patched out so if you\u2019re looking to get this game, buy it physical and keep it unpatched until you have your home paid off and 10-20 million bells in the bank. This game feels like Nintendo testing out a live service. Expect monetization in the next title.\r Full Score Breakdown\r Story: 2/10 - The same as any other game, except you\u2019re on an island. The neighbor characters are still just as one dimensional.\r Graphics: 8/10 - Good looking switch game. Could look a bit better in some places.\r Sound Quality: 3/10 - The music is nice and calming, but there\u2019s no voice acting and there\u2019s only so much gibberish speak you can tolerate. No excuse to not be played on mute honestly.\r Gameplay: 5/10 - Being able to decide where everything goes is by far the best new feature. Unfortunately the game still runs on real time, so there\u2019s only so long you can play it for at a time. Overall gameplay is like any other title, except somehow more inconvenient in some places.\r Fun Factor: 7/10 - Pretty fun to maintain the island and arrange it to your liking.\r Stability: 9/10 - You can do some pretty weird things by placing items in strange places but that\u2019s pretty much it.\r Game Vs Service: 4/10 - Playable offline, but Nintendo are constantly releasing cut out content back into the game every month instead of just releasing a complete game.\r Start To Finish: 3/10 - Getting K.K to play at your island can be done in 20ish hours if you exit the game and fast forward time.\r Longevity: 6/10 - You\u2019re either gonna play it forever or get tired of it after a couple weeks. This score is the even ground between casual and hardcore players.\r Worth: 5/10 - It won\u2019t get cheap anytime soon, but i you see it for $30 or less, grab it.","Switch+\u52a8\u68ee+Corona=2020\uff0c\u5bf9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\u653e\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u52a8\u68ee\u90fd\u8fbe\u4e0d\u52302020\u5e74\u7684\u70ed\u5ea6\u3002\r\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u817b\u7684\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6bcf\u5929\u767b\u9646\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b63\u8282\u540e\uff08\u6625\u590f\uff09\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u89c9\u5f97\u65e0\u804a\uff0c\u518d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8fdb\u53bb\u8fc7\u3002","This game is a masterpiece. With great graphics and pleasant game play, you'll be playing this game non-stop for several months. However, at least for me, after about 3 months of playing this game, it starts to get a little old and I burnt out a little bit, which I think is one of the main problems with this game. Regardless of that though, it's still an incredibly fun experience and I recommend it.","Nintendo update the game and allow at least 2 islands per switch, just do that","Un timo. Resulta que si quiero que jueguen mis dos hijos tengo que comprar otra consola, sino uno solo puede ir a la isla de otro. Unos fen\u00f3menos estos de Nintendo.","The game is very entertaining and relaxing, I love to be playing according to the season in which we are, and also includes events, no matter whether you are a casual player or not, the important shelf is to know enjoy the game without having to throw unnecessary toxicity","It\u2019s fun for the first 20 hours then it\u2019s gets REALLY SOUR and I just don\u2019t like it I would say buy when all of the updates come out and it could be 100 hours of fun gameplay","If you are first player, the game is amazing. If you're not... I stopped playing the game when I realize that I couldn't achieve some major developments or enjoy the full experience. Not even with another copy of the game...","This game is beautiful and relaxing, but for me they've fallen a bit short. The mechanics are simple, very simple, but I feel that a complex system will ruin the game. Would be very fun that they add minigames like in previous games, maybe a supermario in the NES or something like that, or a pinball on the pinball you can buy. The villagers are so cute, but the limit of 10 is stupid when you have a big island. Is always the same, they have something right but they fall short.","This could have been a Nintendo masterpiece, however the fact that I had to buy a second Switch (lite) just so that both my wife and I could play is really terrible customer service from Nintendo.  I am now super frustrated that I cant move my game over to the bigger Switch and play on the TV. I have been stuck with the small screen for months and despite the fact that my wife is done with the game I have no option but to use the lite version.  I pay for the online service but cant transfer my game between the two devices that I had to purchase! With every other game I own I can use both consoles as it suits. Nintendo has basically ruined the whole point of owning a Switch with this game. Again, terrible policy/customer service.","I simply cannot write a positive review of this game due to the one island for the entire console idiocy.  Why did Nintendo choose to do such a stupid thing?  My other games can handle it.  Come on Nintendo, put out a patch!!","If you have more than one person in your household that wants to play this game, everyone but the primary person is screwed. Only the primary person is gets the recipes to craft most of the furniture, and only the primary person can build homes for new residents or do any of the stuff required to advance the story. The other people can't even help out, other than gathering resources (woo fun).","Look. Play the older games before this. If you don\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t get the whole concept. Animal Crossing is supposed to be based off a town, not an island. Many characters got removed from previous games. If you have slow WiFi, you can\u2019t get the updates, which are limited and are just returning features from previous games. Every previous AC game didn\u2019t require Internet, but this one does. I am warning you, don\u2019t play this. Play the older games. If you have a GameCube or Wii, get Animal Crossing GameCube.","This is a truly great game for the Switch. I understand why people review bomb this game, but it doesn't mean that this game gets a 0.","Such a lovely game - was an introduction to me into the world of Nintendo Switch platform. It gives you anything you need to feel calm and pleasant while playing it. Complaints about weak multiplayer are reasonable.","The multi-player policies tied to this game are truly outrageous\u2014truly, truly, truly outrageous. It's always sad to see a well-crafted game brought to its demise by admin.","I know it's kinda weird how there is only 1 island per console but as the single user of my Nintendo Switch, it doesn't really matter.","It was very fun for about a month and a half. After that, the game was just too tedious for me to personally keep playing, and I wish they were more proactive about having small updates.","I'm addicted to this game... It's great, but t's awful to have only 1 island avaible per console and game","This game is incredible! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fThe progression, the differences that happens every day. I love my experience and it is the game that I most played on my switch.","On one hand, I do truly adore this game. The ambiance is spectacular, the in-game holiday celebrations are something I genuinely look forward to, and the amount of connection I feel to my little town and villagers is a bit embarrassing, and seeing the community and creations within and surrounding this is fantastic. It's been genuinely helpful in establishing a routine while at home all day, and I owe it loads for that. On the other hand, I try to be objective on some level.\rACNH makes a number of significant improvements to player experience- but it stops so, so short. The one island per console restriction, the abysmal multiplayer that nearly (unintentionally) captures the absolutely dreadful, slow experience of going to a real airport, tool breakage that serves no gameplay purpose, excruciatingly slow animations for just about every action the player can preform, and so much more make this game so incredibly clunky. Nothing feels streamlined. Nothing feels good to interact with. The villagers have nowhere near enough dialogue to feel realistic, and at a point the gameplay loop gets extremely repetitive, and yet charm alone stops me from rating this any lower.\rThere's a lot to say about atmosphere in video games, and this is a prime example of the drastic effect it can have on games. If you're interested in a nice quaint experience, you should absolutely buy it. if you're looking for a good game, look elsewhere.","\u0417\u0430 2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0437\u0430 5\u043a \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430 2,5\u043a,\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443... \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e,\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0436\u043e\u043f\u0443! \u041d\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439!","In my eyes, this game is near perfect. Granted, I don't have the gripes other people have with the game as I've spent most of the game playing on my own so far (girlfriend is getting a switch this week). The progression is not a big issue, it keeps me coming back to the game every day. There's not always a ton of stuff to do everyday, which is one of my issues, but there's enough going on to keep you coming back and coming back each day.\r Villagers feel reasonably alive and you actually begin caring about them, giving and receiving gifts is a nice touch. I also started out with a sisterly villager (Rocket) who always seems to give me recipes and gifts when I'm having trouble. For a lot of people this is the game that got them into Animal Crossing (it certainly is for me), and I don't think that's a problem at all as the game lays out a lot of the groundwork for you and explains a lot of the ins and outs fairly quickly. There is definitely some figuring out to do and that's fine.\r Maybe the one island thing will become a problem for me in future, but at the moment it's not and I'm rather enjoying logging in every day and seeing what's new and what's going on. If you have your own Switch to have by yourself, I think you'll have fun with this game and get a lot of enjoyment out of it. For me it's a 9, for some others it might be a 5 (or lower) and that's perfectly fine. The gripes I've seen from others are legitimate, especially players who are sharing a switch as I can imagine that would get annoying so I'm not going to gloss over those but I will say it obviously hasn't been something that has affected me.\r Where I think the game falls short from a 10 generally is there is a lot of waiting. Waiting can kill your enjoyment for that day and I've found myself quitting the game and waiting for the next day (which is occasionally 5am as I'm on Blathers' time). But with that said, I have logged into the game everyday since I bought it, and it's honestly a blast. 9/10 is a fair score for a game like this, at least in my opinion.","Really good game, it was so beautiful playing this at quarantine, 200 hours in 2 months of quarantine, I don't remember any other game that make me play like a crazy boy.","\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. 220+ \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430! \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u044c\u044e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438, \u0441 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c! \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f. \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u044f\u043b\u0432\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435. \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0421\u0432\u0438\u0447 - \u0432\u044b \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0435 - \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438\u044e.\r 12/10 \u043e\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f!\r just an amazing game. 220+ hours of pure delight! game with the friendliest community, with interesting features and just a positive mood! and with all this, the game continues to evolve. the seasons change, new chips appear that were not there before. if you have a Switch - you should definitely try this game.\rwith a Nintendo subscription, it's even more interesting - since you can play with a friend.\r12/10 from me!","The one island per switch thing is nonsense, instant 0/10.

The online connectivity is bonkers and is super annoying when connecting with multiple people. Not sure why I have to watch a 2 minute video everytime someone comes and goes from my island. The crafting system is a neat addition, but sharing the island on the switch means that resources are quickly used up by one player.","I'm sorry but this game was released incomplete. It has half of the content that New Leaf had on the 3DS, 7 years ago. No furniture sets, no gyroids, no upgrades for shops, no other shops, no rare sets, no silver tools, no various minerals, no minigames, the online is really awful and has a 40 seconds load time for each person that visits. I'll just go bacj to the 3DS as it had more content and actual STUFF to do besides just \"decorating\" which seems the whole point of the game as it is now. My advice is don't buy it. Updates won't even save it probably.","I'm sure this game is awesome, but too bad I'll never play it. I can't give a game a score above 0 if it isn't even playable to myself and many others (yeah secondary players can join an island, but let's be real they can't do much). Needing 1 console per player is insane, I hope they fix this some day.","My spouse and I decided to get this game as a gift to ourselves for christmas, money was tight, but we heard such great things about Animal crossing so decided this was the game for us. I guess I should have searched for \"Is Animal Crossing trash for the second player\" before opening the game package(and voiding the return policy), but who would have though that would even be a concern. Well, it is absolute trash for the second player on the console. So unless you have multiple switches, and multiple copies of animal crossing, don't even bother getting this game if you intend to share with your family. I was OK with sharing an island with my spouse, but didn't realize that the game would make player two feel like a second class citizen, who's only goal in life is to work manual labor without any satisfaction of game progression opportunities.","Very fun game. Love the expansive world. Really disappointed by the limits put on any player that is not the \"Resident Representative\". I was so excited to get this game. My partner got it for me and we were both so excited to play together. But we have been very disappointed by the way that his player can play almost no part in the development of the island. It is a very fun game, but he is being kept from playing it, which makes it disappointing and less fun for me to play.","I've bought this game with my sister. Well, I thought it was me doing something wrong but now I see i'm not. The one primary residence per console is quite annoying. I'm extremely disappointed. Asking to fix it please!","A great game and in my opinion the best animal crossing game ever. The graphics are a huge upgrade from its prequel and it offers almost everything an Animal Crossing game should have. In addition to this it also has an interesting setting and you can always find something to do. But although it is great I have two issues with this game: The lack of multiple islands on a single system have disappointed a lot of people and even though I am not bothered by it too much, because I have my own switch, I can definitely understand the criticism and my second issue is that I simply don\u2019t enjoy talking to the villagers that much anymore. In past games villagers had more personality and could actually be a bit mean to you, in new horizons however I feel like the villagers are just always pretty nice and generic with sometimes lines repeating after you spoke to them a few times. In the predecessors I felt more attached to my villagers while in the current title they feel kind of bland and uninteresting. But despite those negatives it still makes a great game which I have put hundreds of hours into and is definitely worth it\u2019s money. An outstanding experience but with a few drawbacks that don\u2019t quite make it perfect in my eyes.","It is a perfect life sim game with one substantial drawback - if you own only one switch console there is no way to create more than one island. It does not affect me, because even if there was an option to start separate island, I would not like to do so. However, there should be an option.\rAnd only because of that I rate this game 9/10. Overall it is very solid game, that I recommend to anyone.","This is an amazing single player game. Unfortunately the truly lovely dev team didn't learn from other contemporary multiplayer games. You can't join your friends easily because there are 5 obnoxious hoops you have to jump through. Fix the multiplayer please! Have an app on the nook phone that just teleports you an online friend if they accept. There should not be such a tremendous roadblock even if they were trying to protect kids from online gaming or something.","Few games, if any, have so serendipitously been released in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. For many, Animal Crossing: New Horizons provided the perfect conduit of escapism from the uncertainty and constant change in norms that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. And it doesn't hurt that, beyond the creature comforts and good vibes, there's a genuine case to be made for New Horizons as the best Animal Crossing ever. For the type of player who is extremely focused on curation, New Horizons offers the most customizable experience to date. And yet the more time you spend engaging with everything its world has to offer, the more likely it is for a profound sense of frustration and hollowness to set in. Many improvements to the series formula feel incremental rather than revolutionary, and there's a certain clunkiness to many design elements that you might expect a series to have ironed out by its fifth main installment. Worth noting is that despite numerous updates over the last year, the game still isn't nearly as rich in features or activities as its predecessor on the Nintendo 3DS. These are largely moot points, however, because the game delivers where it counts for many: As a fever-dream of cozy fantasy, and a brief antidote to increasingly uncertain times.","A very good game and came in the perfect timing. I can\u2018t stop playing this game!","Extremely disappointed with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. We bought this game thinking the whole family could play. Turns out only one person can truly play. Secondary and any additional players on the island are not able to participate in the story line or further the game progress. If you are a secondary player, you are doomed to an existence of collecting junk and decorating your house. That\u2019s it. Extremely boring. This game will be thrown on the junk heap of games that are never played. What a waste of money.","It's just boring, progress is slow and a couch co-op mode is made in the worst way what you can think about. There isn't a split screen just one lead player and rest of them need to follow. Only one have access to equipment. It is just terrible experience. Even if you want to fish with other... You can't because usually there is just one fish on the screen which you can get.","Limiting the game to one island per switch is ridiculous. Nintendo just keeps getting more mediocre and greedy instead of getting better. There is no good reason for this limitation,  hope y'all fix it cause this is effed up.","Wanted to have a go at my sons game. Couldn't play without crashes his island. I'm not buying a second console just to experience a solo game each. Trying to extort switch sales by limiting functions in their games. Tut-tut Nintendo.","This game would be a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fact the game is stretched along days and months just to get certain things done. I also don't appreciate how you have to pay for two separate switches, two separate games each costing 40$ and a Nintendo switch online membership. If you look past all of that the game can be really really fun especially with fishing, crafting and villagers. Not a perfect game though.","I was very hyped about this game in first month of playing. After several house and shop upgrades game became more boring. Repetitive announcements without good info like weather, who is at island, same route everyday and talking with villagers is not really entertaining-repetitive conversations. I'm stuck in lack of ideas for decorating, I wish that there were more items.  Multiplayer is really irritating, when a player invites more than one player (freeze screen when one is leaving).\r Loading screens when I see my face on switch screen make me think: What am I doing with my life?. Was that Nintendo goal?\rIf yes, then be happy, you made it.","It's a well-made game though. I love how well detailed this game is, and everything you do before you get a 4-star island feels rewarding.  However the amount of activities feel so limited compared to New Leaf and GCN. Everything feels repetitive from the announcements to the villager dialogue. Also, the multiplayer sucks and one island per console feels suspicious. It isn't like Wild World and its Spinoffs, but it isn't Top 3 best though.","if you dont like to wait for things and do almost the same things every single day dont buy this, it has infinite playability but its just to boring for my taste,  I like quiet games sometimes but this game doesn't even have a normal story, altho thats nintendo :/","I recently restarted my island after dropping off from the game around June last year and am enjoying it again so far, collecting all the bugs and fish and sea creatures and moving islanders in. It's a beautiful game, and I really enjoy the landscaping and creative freedom you have when creating your island. Unfortunately, after you finish building, there's nothing very worthwhile left to experience. I think this is why I stopped playing originally.\r Compared to previous games, the events are much more focused around collecting items/DIYs than interacting with your villagers and the special visitors. As a result, every seasonal event feels sort of the same. The villagers themselves are also super boring to interact. At first, they give you tasks, but as you progress that seems to stop. Even then, the number of tasks you get isn't comparable to previous entries at all. It is very much unlike the previous games in that regard, where helping your villagers felt like a focal point. Villagers of the same personality also feel very similar. I think this is because they tend to talk about what you did yesterday, rather than asking questions or talking about themselves. I've heard this is because of the way dialogue is prioritised, not because it's limited.\r The incremental updates have improved the game over time and kept things interesting, and since Nintendo says the game should have a 3 year lifespan, we can probably expect more. Long story short, if you like the idea of designing and collecting (bugs, fish, fossils, art, DIYs, items etc), buying New Horizons is well worth the time and enjoyment you'll get out of it. If you prefer the older games because of the dynamic interactions you get with villagers, or New Leaf for the interesting/varied seasonal events, maybe skip this one out.","acnh\r pros\r- great music\r- near perfect diy mode\r- kept bell service is gold\r- perfect fishing system\r cons\rexpensive items and terrible resident services\rbut every other thing fully makes up for the cons","Gameplay:\rAnimal Crossing New Horizon is a life simulation game based On a world full of cute animals. Your goal in this game is to build a house, craft tools, and beautify your tropical island. You have to borrow the \" Bell \" which is the currency in this game from Tom Nook to pay the debt, players can get from doing a variety of in-game activities.\rThis game is based on real-time on doing the activity on the islands every activity takes time to finish. It has a free play style. You can start by building a house, decorate a garden, go fishing and do gardening or catching insects, and others. The game also has upcoming events to explore based on real-world events. Animals in your village can interact with you on your island which is the charm of this game.\rThe game also features seasonal events like the previous ones, such as winter or summer, with different fruits or fish and insects.  You can also be able to select the region of your island which will affect the environment in the game. The uniqueness is that players can choose the location of their neighbor's home. Of course, players can be able to bond with their neighbors by interaction, and it will result in the acquisition of cool items and the events that will occur.\rAnimal Crossing New Horizons also has an online feature system where you and your friend's island. You can do activities together which makes the game even more fun. We have the ability to customize the island with the Terraforming feature which is a new system in the Animal Crossing franchise.\r Graphics:\rThe arrival of Animal Crossing New Horizons on Switch comes with great graphics performance. Because a hybrid console specification makes it perform much better than the previous games. The graphics in the game still come in the same style that looks lovely. The character design is not different from the original, but it is cute and looks very good, and has always been unique to the Animal Crossing series. The game has a very nice color scheme in design that is pleasing to all ages. The camera angle in the game can be adjusted a little.\r Soundtrack:\rNintendo has brought the talented team of musicians behind Animal Crossing: New Horizons' music back together for a beautiful acoustic performance with the stylish tropical life simulator's soundtrack that includes more than the 96 K.K. Slider songs that players can collect and listen to.\r Overview:\rAnimal Crossing New Horizon is very free. This game can be very enjoyable when we have to stay at home to enjoy an island full of activities to do. This game can still play for years without the same boredom. Even though the game pace looks a bit slow, there is a lot of hidden stuff in the game to unlock waiting for you to explore.","The Animal Crossing series has created a unique sense of relaxation and joy for close to twenty years. The newest entry, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, continues that tradition while elevating the gameplay to new levels. This elevation in gameplay is quite literally in-game now where a player can actually change the geography of their island. Island terraforming is debatably the biggest addition to this version of the game. In past iterations, customization was reserved for the players home and clothing, but it is now possible to modify everything from where your cliffs and rivers are located, to a coffee cup placed on an outdoor table. The debut of vast island customization options are accompanied by a robust crafting system. Players can now gather resources located across the island to craft custom furniture and tools. These new aspects feel like they were heavily influenced by survival games, like Minecraft, but they still retain the Animal Crossing charm that fans cherish.\r One added survival game mainstay that has caused some outcry amongst Animal Crossing fans is tool degradation. In previous entries, tools like shovels, fishing rods, and nets could be used indefinitely without breaking, but in Animal Crossing: New Horizons players have to fight the constant battle of tools being destroyed through use. It appears that this decision was made to strengthen the need for the crafting system, however it seems to impede on the relaxing elements of the game, like fishing. One of the most frustrating aspects of this game is being in the midst of a peaceful fishing trek around the permitter of my island only for my rod to break with a half full inventory of fish. Then forcing me to return to my islands town center to craft a new one. In the past, this return to town was driven by a need to sell your goods from that fishing session. This rewarding journey into town to sell your commodities is now joined by a similar but shameful trip into town to craft another fishing rod. This new element has certainly detracted from the joyful and relaxing cornerstone of fishing in Animal Crossing games.\r Though the crafting system is a cumbersome addition in regards to tools, its inclusion has certainly evolved the overall gameplay from a depth perspective. It has added more incentives to collect items and forage for resources across your island while rewarding you with interesting things to craft. Island customization is a welcome addition that can result in hours of rewarding gameplay. One of my favorite things to do is to add a small decorative piece to the island and wait to see if my wife notices when she is playing with her character. I don\u2019t ever see my island being \u201ccomplete\u201d and I plan to constantly tweak aspects of it throughout the years.\r Island customization adds to the replay-ability of the game, but something that pulls me back in even more are the seasonal updates and events that Nintendo releases for free. Two large updates were summer updates that debuted new gameplay elements to the Animal Crossing franchise like swimming in the ocean and diving to the depths of your coasts to retrieve sea creatures. Nintendo is even teasing their next big update which appears to be a Halloween themed addition. These updates provide a reason to hop back in and you will quickly find yourself sucked right back into the joyous gameplay.\r One unfortunate side effect of island living in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is that it minimizes the enjoyment, previously supplied in previous entries, of adventuring to other islands. In previous entries, players could leave their continental town and take a boat ride to explore a tropical island where unique fish and items could be found. This enjoyment to escape your typical scenery has been replaced with the option to take a plane ride to randomly generated islands. Beyond plundering an island of its fruit and potentially discovering the elusive tarantula island, the incentive for players to get away isn't quite there anymore. An update that I would love to see Nintendo explore would be to diversify what you might find when taking a plane trip. Potentially discovering different biomes and fauna on these excursions would be a fantastic way to incentivize exploration and could recapture the magic of island visits from previous entries.\r Overall this entry is a welcome addition to a beloved pedigree of games. Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes the chill and relaxing vibe of previous titles and modernizes it with more customization and structure. For Busch League, this game bordered a 9.5 out of 10, but features like item degradation and a less enjoyable island exploration process were steps back for the series. Busch League Gaming gives Animal Crossing: New Horizons a 9 out of 10.\r For our full podcast review, visit https://www.buschleaguegaming.com/podcast/animal-crossing-new-horizons.","The game has a slow start but after playing it for 3 weeks now and I am addicted to it. Even if I have nothing to do I'm still playing just walking around.","Esta divertido y todooo eso mi unico problema es el crafteo de objetos es lo que no me gusta del juego fuera de todo eso para mi esta bien","I would give this a 92%\rThis is a nice calm game to play solo\rbut the thing is if you have the same console and you want to start a new island on a new account you have to restart which is annoying they should give you a option but besides that it is a good game!","My emotions has been a roller coaster ride with this game so far since I never experienced playing New Leaf. I've clocked about 150 hours into this game so this is my review so far:\rThe best way I can describe this game is that at times it feels like the Sims 4 but with animals. At times it can come off as just a choir and d\u00e9cor game were all you do is just the same thing day in and day out: go fishing, look for shells, sell or buy something, gardening, talk to neighbors who really don't have much of anything important to say.  It just comes off as very repetitive with extremely slow progress. The only reason I've clocked this many hours is because I started this game off with my fianc\u00e9e at first, it was fun for a while until you notice that this game is not meant to be a two person player type of game. Who ever is first player, you will have to follow them around *everywhere* they go and if you don't then you will get poofed to the location that they are in.  This makes multiplayer extremely frustrating when you want to do two different things on the opposite side of the island cause it's impossible to do. One of you will just have to sit there and wait and occupy yourself with something in the immediate area first player is in until they decide to move. This game doesn't allow two or at least 3 different saves you are only stuck with one island, in my opinion, this was a terrible decision for this game and shouldn't have been done. My fianc\u00e9e had lost interest at playing at one point since things were to slow to his liking, I continued playing but noticed I was getting no where with my island, not much of anything was occurring until I released my fianc\u00e9e was still player one. I ended up deleting the first save and started fresh.\r Once I started over, I noticed huge amount of  improvement. I noticed more bugs, got more land and started meeting more characters, so that is an upside. Now that I'm somewhere in the middle of updating my new island, I released  that you or your villagers can't interact with their surrounding, for the most part all of my villagers do is just walk around, talk to each other now and then, possible water the plants and that's it. Not once have a seen a villager or visitor go inside the museum, buy anything from the nook shop, you pretty much have to gift them everything. Some gifts that you gave them won't even be in theirs homes so it will be as if you never gave it to them..it just depends on what the item is.  It would be nice if d\u00e9cor objects were interactable with my character and villagers, It's pretty to look at but just feels like pointless objects that do nothing but  lying around your island. I want more than just \"pretty to look at\" especially with a game like animal crossing.\r Lacking the ability to evict certain villagers or decorate objects in this game is bothering when this entire game is about creating your own world.  I dislike that there is no option to go into town hall and evict a villager you no longer want on your island, your forced to be mean or isolate them in hopes of them wanting to move but there's no telling when that will occur same with waiting for a visitors to arrive at the campsite. It's also disappointing that you can't recolor store items or balloon gifts cause they may already come with variations, the only thing you can recolor is DIYs you make which is restrictive for no reason. Tools constantly breaking after a couple hits is huge annoyance! Recrafting the same **** over and over again is not fun after the 100th time, especially when you're adding iron to the object- it should last longer than that!\r The game also has a huge problem with regeneration! I can't tell you how many times I have collected a bunch of fossils only for Blathers to tell me that one (sometimes NONE) out of many fossils I had over to him are good cause they are already in the freaking museum! Why is the island regenerating the same damn fossils!? This problem is also occurring with bottle and balloon DIYs and Nook Mile ticket islands that end up wasting 2,000 miles on cause it's the SAME empty island I've already gone to before despite them saying you can't ever visit the island again? I have yet to find any new villagers at my campsite or any of these islands. It makes traveling frustrating and not worth it at times.\r This issue of blocking certain islanders to maintain 10 only caused Leif to stop showing up entirely. For the first time ever, I had to time travel (changed my time zone to Honolulu) just to get him to finally show back up again since the last time I had seen him was a while ago.  I'm still playing, I paid for this game so i want to see what happens next but there's room for tons and tons of improvement.","By far one of the best games on switch I would say. Being able to escape the real world and make a deserted island your new home is a fantastic experience, and now being able to craft furniture and pop it outside is a massive improvement for the animal crossing series.\r This game is extremely addictive, as there is so much to do with your island. Eventually you will probably get sick of it, but you only feel like that after you've played it for ages.\r A common gripe I have seen is tools breaking. Yes, it can be a little bit annoying at times, but it certainly shouldn't stop you from playing this fantastic game, and I didn't find that it disrupted my gameplay too much.\r I highly recommend playing this game, as it will provide hours of fun for anyone.","Es un genial juego que todos deber\u00edan probar, aprovechando que este juego a revivido la saga. No todo es positivo debido a que faltan cosas de otros juegos de la saga (peluquer\u00eda, observatorio de estrellas...)Si quieres empezar jugando a la saga Animal Crossing recomiendo este","one of the best nintendo switch games but it is not for everyone if you are looking for a relaxing game that lets you squeeze your creativity to the fullest this is your separate game that you can dedicate more than 500 hours but if what you are looking for is action and destroy monsters better get away and is more for 1 person so if you want a good multiplayer game choose another game","Its a fun game in the first month, but after that it just kinda sucks. Progress goes veeeery sloooow.","Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a simulation type of game where you can make stuff, pay debt and be friends with animals! It's a fun concept, and it was well executed here! But, it did lack allot of what made Animal Crossing... Well, Animal Crossing. The crafting mechanic is cool, but, It's very annoying when your tool breaks, you have to rebuilt it all over again with the materials. It also lacks allot of the charm New Leaf had in my opinion. New Leaf had cool bonus items like a Wii U and even Nintendo game themed items! Animal Crossing: New Horizons lacks allot of that. But, don't get me wrong, It's a blast making your island look cool with furniture, visiting other's island and even playing with friends once in awhile is great! I would recommend it to almost everyone, since they updated the game to have more to it, but, It didn't grab me back as much as New Leaf did.","Boring.I thought this game was some what like a \u201cslow Sims\u201d But after I found out that in order to continue this game, I need to do laboring continuos things like fishing over and over\u2026when I find out that there is nothing much story flowing which made me boring and stop playing this game.","This game was suppose to be the savior of this pandemic. Nintendo said, they would update this game for years. but i cant see that happening. when it released, you weren't even able to swim. on an island setting.... so that they fixed that with an update was just a must. all events are just the same with different settings. the rewards are meaningless and don't serve anything of value. it is simply aweful that you have to get all the furniture with DIYs from balloons and villagers and so on. you get way too many duplicates. its absolutely not fun. beeing forced to go in online forums and look for someone who maybe has a needed DIY. the shops are absolutely small. they offer so little products. its annoying. you can craft in bulk its just annoying. many things of this game are just there to take ages. just like the terraforming. but the devs had to make it as annoying and time consuming as possible for every single chore. because the game has absolutely nothing to offer gameplay wise. you cant do anything with friends. no minigames. no nothing. you are forced to make your own imaginary games. i simply cant understand how this game has a perfect score from official media. this game is incredibly shallow. all villager say the same everyday. they don't have any character. they are not interesting at all. have nothing to say. the game lacks so many features, furniture, events and gameplay from past games. the game still haven't got an update 2.0. its been over a year now and they still didn't implement anything of value to the game. all they do is recycle events and bring some more seasonal items to the game. they basically don't update the game at all til now. for over a year since release. (because the last big thing was the ability to swim. and this was simply a must. and even that wasn't even a new thing -.-)\r and one more annoying thing... they don't listen to the community at all. they ignore everything. so its just worse that they make twitter posts on a regular basis everytime they implement another meaningless item. or recycle an event again. they got their money and now they just don't give a damn about this game anymore or their fans. oh and the multiplayer is just the worst. there is absolutely nothing positive about it. but that was expected. Nintendo has no skill for online experiences. they screw up every single multiplayer ever.\r to end this review on a more positive note... there are some good things. the graphic is pleasing and the soundtrack is great. good for chilling. the rest of the game is nothing but a dumpster fire.\r tl;dr\rpros:\r- soundtrack\r- graphics\r- nostalgia\r cons:\r- gameplay\r- NPC AI\r- crafting\r- gameplay\r- all the time wasting gameplay mechanics\r- all the small shops\r- all the missing shops and villager from the past\r- all the missing furniture from the past\r- gameplay\r- no minigames\r- online multiplayer\r- only one island per switch console\r- the ticket islands are just boring and repeat way too often and look all the same\r- items break way too quick with no indication\r- gameplay\r- building, placing and terraforming is very very imprecise and clunky\r- all events are recycled and the rewards are bad.\r- getting all the stuff from redd is just the worst. it can easily happen that you wont see him for month!!\r- gameplay\r- and basically everything else which makes games, games.","Even if people find the game boring because of the lack of updates, I still find it interesting because creativity is a strong factor for me that keeps me coming back. I could go on forever and ever about this game, but long story short, this game deserved it's 10/10 rating from me.","The game is pretty mediocre, the graphics looks astoundingly beautiful and minimalistic, but that's pretty much it. Content-wise it has less content than indie games like Stardew Valley that costs six times less and it's miles better. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is severely lacking if compared to the previous ones, a lot of NPCs and shops were cut out, the villagers interactions are pretty dull and becomes repetitive pretty fast, the numbers of buildings went from 13 (New Leaf) to a baffling 4 in New Horizons. Also they got out with some pretty nasty and scammy decisions that tainted the experience for me like for example:\r -One island per console. If you want to create another island, buying another copy of the game isn't enough, you'd literally have to buy another $300 console\r -The game released pretty unfinished, and they got out with it by saying they would implement free updates. Well, one year later and those updates proved to be VERY underwhelming and repetitive (literally every holiday event is: collect this item on the map, trade it for furniture, repeat). And even after one whole year the game is still severely lacking compared to previous ones or the microtransaction one (Pocket Camp)\r -Some RNGs in the game are pretty much broken, my art museum is still pretty much empty because the Redd boat was programmed to almost never show up in the Island, so unless you're willing to time travel (which shouldn't even be a feature) you'll probably never gonna complete your museum collection.\r -After, like, two weeks playing the game you'll probably =burn out everything the game has to offer and the only thing left for you to do is to check the holiday events that, again, is pretty much the same thing with a new skin.\r -The mini-games, common in every Animal Crossing entry, are non-existent in this one.\r -Brewster, Tortimer and Kapp'n aren't in the game and probably won't be added\r -The gyroids, also common in every entry, are also non-existent in this one\r -The game is probably abandoned by Nintendo at this point and won't have updates anymore.","A solid entry in the animal crossing franchise, but do we really need crafting?","This is a fun, relaxing game. The crafting mechanic is fun for a little bit. It gets tiresome crafting the same thing while spamming the A button (especially to make fish bait). I wish that they had a craft all button or something like that. The main reason for this low score is because of the \"one island per console\" move that Nintendo pulled when they released this game. It's such a scummy move. They also had a bunch of features cut that were present in New Leaf cut only to bring them back in a later update. This was also perhaps the first time Redd wasn't in the base game at launch. Also the tool breaking function is really annoying especially when you're in \"the late game.\" There really isn't a benefit to getting golden tools like in the previous games. The golden tools break in this game which kind of feels like a slap in the face especially for the amount of work you need to do to get the golden tools.\r Overall this game is really fun and I enjoyed it. Annoyances aside, Nintendo's scummy implementation of game mechanics brought the rating down from a 8 to 10 to a 4.","An extremely lacking game in which I could barely give a 3. The music's boring. The graphics are very plastic-like. The dialogue is repetitive. There are few tasks, and this game could get put on the shelf within a few days. It's tedious to work with. It's bland and I've gotten some bored of this game, that I have sold the game back to the store. Not even two weeks in. I can't believe I even bought this game. Why is it $60? It's worth about $5 to me. I might try Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but for now, I need to rant.","The game suffers from being a sequel to New Leaf and also trying to be a Minecraft alternative.\r New Leaf was an amazing game, one of my favourites of all time. My first year of playing, I managed to sink in over 500 hours. The game added so much, improved upon so much, it was one of my favourite video games of all time!\r Then imagine my excitement when it was revealed a new Animal Crossing was coming to Switch. I was over-joyed! I was thinking about all the new possibilities, the new features, how it expands off of New Leaf! The trailer came in for February 2020, and then my hype was slightly narrowed down when they revealed Crafting... I was concerned at the time, however soon my concern would turn into a nightmare when I got the game on March 20th. I put the game in my Switch and was having a blast, however instead of what happened with New Leaf, where the game lasted me over half a year before I felt the need to take an extended break, it only took me just over a month to think that New Horizons should have been avoided. My Nightmares became true. The crafting was almost everything the game centred around, and it wasn't fun. Many objectives I was given, wether for Nook Miles or because of some Tom Nook stuff early on in the game, felt tedious rather than fun, like I didn't actually want to get these and look for these, but instead I felt an obligation to so then I could complete the game.\r Then when I eventually got far in the game, I begun waiting for updates, because there were numerous issues the game faced. No Roost, No Shampoodle, No Re-Tail, no Shops besides Nook's Cranny and Able Sisters. The game was empty in features, and I sat down in my seat during every Direct, every trailer, hoping for a new building to be revealed. The realisation came in around Autumn, these were never going to come. The game was doomed to be a dissappointment.\r The game was the first dissappointing Animal Crossing experience for me. I first started with City Folk / Let's Go To The City, and I loved it to death! Then I played Wild World for a short bit. Despite being a downgrade from the first game even, I still thoroughly enjoyed it for a more laid-back feeling, like you don't have to worry about coming on time for events as much, and you could go at your own pace, and it would still be fun. Then I played New Leaf, and like I said, one of my favourite games of all time, with City Folk / Let's Go To The City not far behind. Then I played the First game a few months after getting New Leaf, loved the game to death as well. Notice how all of the prior games to New Horizons, I loved playing like they were the only games I had in my collection. Hell, I even enjoyed Happy Home Designer and Amiibo Festival, and have started 2 towns for every game in the series, except for one... New Horizons...\r New Horizons wasn't fun, and generally it was a mediocre - bad experience. It lacked the soul and features of other game, so you might as well buy those ones and their respective consoles instead, even if it costs more, it's still more worthy of the \u00a350 - $60 price tag slapped on this, at best \u00a320 - $25 experience.\r One issue I would like to discuss quickly which can really show Nintendo's True Intent was that you could only have 1 island per Switch! So if you shared a Switch with family members, good luck trying to have your own independant experience!","PROS:\r- Tiene una introducci\u00f3n maravillosa.\r- Es tremendamente inmersivo y sus personajes te hacen tener \"sentimientos\" r\u00e1pidamente.\r- Sus mec\u00e1nicas nuevas respecto a entregas anteriores hacen que sea tan diferente pero a la vez sin perder la esencia de lo que es.\r- Soundtrack exquisito.\r- Es adictivo jugablemente.\r CONTRAS:\r- Llega un momento en donde no hayas m\u00e1s qu\u00e9 hacer, lo cu\u00e1l es cr\u00edtico para este tipo de videojuegos.\r- No hay una vasta variedad de di\u00e1logos de los vecinos; hay solo 10 tipos de di\u00e1logos seg\u00fan su personalidad, pero much\u00edsimos m\u00e1s de ellos, lo cual causa que solo cambien en apariencia.\r- Pantallas de carga y tutoriales excesivamente molestos al momento de jugar en l\u00ednea.\r- Falta de minijuegos.\r- Para lo que significa el g\u00e9nero, puede que por momentos lo relajante se vuelva aburrido.\r El m\u00e1s reciente t\u00edtulo de la saga Animal Crossing cubre muchas carencias que ten\u00edan anteriormente, pero al mismo tiempo le quita personalidad y se vuelve muy mon\u00f3tono a las horas antes de \"acabar\" el juego. Tambi\u00e9n a\u00f1ade contenido invasivo que f\u00e1cilmente podr\u00eda no estar, pero eso no quita que sea un juego de calidad, bien hecho y con contenido suficiente, hasta cierto punto. New Horizons es un boleto de entrada a la saga y sirve de base para la consola de Nintendo, pues cualquiera que cuente con una deber\u00eda tenerlo.","I got Animal Crossing New Horizons in March.First it was really interesting and I played almost the whole day, but when I was finished with the main part ( having all the villagers, having all shops/ houses and being happy with how my island turned out) it got boring very quickly. I didn't play for weeks now because I have nothing to do. I have to say that Animal Crossing New Leaf was much better except for the graphics. The villagers were fun and you could to talk to them without them telling u the same few phrases over and over again like in New Horizons. Also it had much more shops and locations like the island with its mini games, the hairdresser and many more. In conclusion I think New Horizons is a fun game but compared to New Leaf it's being left on track.Also it's bothering me, why couldn't nintendo just take New Leaf upgrade it a little bit and leave it there, bet that would've been outsold too in no time...","Hours of fun creating your own island paradise. Set it up the way you want and change anytime. Ultimate control. A great way to waste several hours.","One Island per switch. What the actual? So stupid and scummy. The game itself is ok. Lots of items and ways to shape and decorate your island to make it like home. A few small changes and this game could be a lot better.","They just killed my villagers and special npc's and they let some of them sneak into the game with a threat minimum because they are so terrified that they don't even retain their respective personalities...\r Jokes aside, the game is unfinished almost a year and a half after launch and there is nothing to do in it.\rThe hope that they change it is still there but ... It has two newscasts left.","The game is unfinished and there's only one island per Nintendo Switch. Not only that, but the dialogue is really repetitive. I do not recommend getting this game.","Definitely the weakest in the series after City Folk.\rMany missing features and the new features are a betrayal to the identity of the franchise.\rIt used to be about moving into a new neighborhood and slowly becoming one of the locals. Now it's just about having your personal island dollhouse.\r It makes me worried about the future of the franchise because removing these new features in future titles will make it look reductive but keeping them in will cause the franchise to stagnate. The future is grim.","This game was definitely hype for switch owners when it first came out, but I haven't really played it too much since.  I am looking forward to the DLC, but nobody is looking forward to the expansion pass.\r The graphics are adorable with so much detail and the music is relaxing and rich.  It's just too much text and not enough optimization of the game-play sometimes.  You want to already go there or do that, but you have to deal with that nonsense text.  Stardew Valley was better in this regard.\r Yet I still spent a lot of hours into the game during COVID.  The time just flew by which was sometimes a real problem.","Mentally scaring, could not beat the Tom nook boss fight, way too stressful and difficult, forget mario party, this is the new hardest game of all time","Really good game but you do have to put a lot of time in if you want to progress your island as much as possible. If you\u2019re not worried about completely beating the game it is good just to spend 20 minutes or so on it and just walk around your island.","There are few games that I have sunk more hours into than Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It sucks you in and compells you to return day after day. It's a solid game, as you would expect, from Nintendo. There is a wealth of things to do each day, although earlier in the game it limits you a little \u2014 probably to stop it sucking away your entire life \u2014 and once you've completed the main story arc there is still plenty to do. As the game progresses the story falls away and it becomes more and more like a sandbox game.\r It's not perfect, of course: dialogues are lengthy and often add nothing, and the control mechanism for tools can be infuriating at times (\"no don't dig that up,\" \"put that fence back,\" \"I didn't want to talk to them!\") And as many haters have already stated endlessly, you'll really have to have one console per player in the house since all players on a console share the same island. But in spite of its flaws it's a game that makes me feel good. I will open the game in the morning to check one or two things and then, before I know it, I realise I'm an hour late for work. The online community really makes this game too. Visiting others' islands via online multiplayer is great fun and can help new players get ahead quickly, and it's amazing just how much content (characters, items, recipes, fossils, artworks, bugs, fish, characters' dialogue, etc) they've squeezed in. Well worth the cost when I look at how many hours of ejnoyment I've received from this little gem of a game.","I love the animal crossing franchise don\u2019t get me wrong.. but this game just has so many disappointments I had to say something. It has been over a year and they are JUST NOW adding characters to the game that we have had in almost every other game in the series so far from the beginning. Also with all the updates, and knowing what people are most upset about they have not fixed the issue of one island per switch. It is unrealistic to expect everyone in the household will have their own switch just for this game. It was more reasonable to think that with the 3DS and even then multiple cartrigas got you multiple islands. On the GameCube multiple memory cards meant multiple saves. On the switch it\u2019s one island per switch and everyone who uses that CONSOLE (as much as they want it to also be a handheld, it\u2019s a console) has to live on the same island and only the person who starts the file actually gets any real say in how the island progresses. That makes it so that no one else really gets to enjoy the full game. If you have multiple family members sharing a switch that want to play the full game prepare to be disappointed. This fix would not be hard but they chose to ignore the issue in the hopes maybe people will buy more consoles? The new update coming is so large they definitely could have made this part of it and they didn\u2019t. Now that they finally \u201cfinished\u201d the game they released too early over a year later they are starting to release paid dlc? Not surprised they are mostly concerned with money and not their actual fan base.","\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b.\r\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 - \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c?","this game is literally just an early access game disguised as an animal crossing game. there's literally more things to do in new leaf\r edit: nevermind","What a game! I love everything about it - from the adorable characters to the relaxing nature of doing whatever you want on your island.","Disappointing.\r i've seen very polarising reviews here, on one hand you have game critics universally giving every game a 9/10 and never critiquing anything, not this game either. And on the other hand you have the barrage of user reviews slamming a 0/10 because of stuff unrelated to the game or not being able to have several islands per copy. Im gonna try to save gaming and actually review the game.\r Animal crossing is in everyway except for graphical fidelity a step down from new leaf.\rAfter the tutorial there is no real progression and it really shines a light on how little there is to do in the game. You can go grind ingredients for recipes you dont have, listen to the 4 possible repeating sentences your villagers can say, or catch bugs/fish. Why is talking to your villagers such a bore? talking to them brings up a submenu basically asking \"are you sure you want to listen to the repeated dialogue again?\". In new leaf, you could talk to villagers for a long time before they started repeating themselves, i really dont know why it is so limited here, since its such a crucial aspect of the game.\r With these main gripes clear, i would like to say that the game isnt all bad, designing your island and home is fun. Fishing is also fun, filling up your museum is the replacement for any progression the game otherwise lacks.\r Overall this is a clear downgrade and the praise the game has gotten (perhaps because of release timing and new players) is not promising. I would recommend new leaf over this every day of the week, and you'll save 30 euro!\r What a shame.","You either love it or hate it I had fun with this game but it is a matter of opinion obviously
