    "# Exercise Ten: Mapping, Twitter Style\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's exercise, we will be working from the class demo. To use the live features, you'll need to get a Twitter account approved through the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) as reviewed in class. If you can't get approval, you can use the alternate method of importing your data via [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your application should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import or collect tweets using a keyword or hashtag. Watch your rate limiting!\n",
    "- Use Pandas to sort and analyze your tweets. \n",
    "- Calculate user coordinates, where feasible, for the set of collected tweets. Again, watch your rate limiting!\n",
    "- Map the tweets using the calculated locations.\n",
    "- Use at least one data visualization from a previous exercise, demo, or the course text to analyze a different element of your tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus challenge, try to map some other quality of your data. For instance, you might only map the locations where a certain word or hashtag is used, or try to visualize the quantity of tweets that share a location using a larger radius dot."
