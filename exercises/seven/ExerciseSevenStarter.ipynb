    "# Exercise Seven Starter: Textual Analysis\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this exercise, I will not be providing the subheadings. Work from our code examples and the textbooks to construct a well-documented notebook that provides a model for initial textual analysis of a multi-document corpus.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Your workflow should:\r\n",
    "- Import at least three documents you would like to compare (from text files, or using another format for a challenge.)\r\n",
    "- Preprocess the text and create a tokenized corpus from the text of the imported documents.\r\n",
    "- Create a document term matrix to enable comparative textual analysis across the full set of documents\r\n",
    "- Chart at least one comparison between the documents, using word frequency to map the text\r\n",
    "- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the documents, using two key words as the point of comparison \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a bonus challenge, consider trying one of the other types of distance modeling described in the text."
